item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop  market  sell and support a wide range of software and hardware for digital media production  management and distribution 
digital media are video  audio or graphic elements in which the image  sound or picture is recorded and stored as digital values  as opposed to analog  or tape based  signals 
our diverse range of product and service offerings enables customers to make  manage  and move media 
we operate our business in two reporting segments  video and film editing and effects video and audio 
an important part of our strategy for the past few years has included expanding and enhancing our product lines and increasing revenues through both acquisitions and internal development of products 
in january  we acquired munich  germany based nxn software gmbh nxn  a leading provider of asset and production management systems specifically targeted for the entertainment and computer graphics industries 
this acquisition expands our offering in digital asset management by enabling our film and video post production  broadcast  audio and d animation customers to leverage the workflow capabilities of the alienbrain r product line 
nxn has been integrated into our video segment 
in august  we completed the acquisition of irwindale  california based m audio  a leading provider of digital audio and midi solutions for electronic musicians and audio professionals 
we have integrated m audio into our audio segment and will market its line of audio products alongside digidesign s digital audio workstations for the professional and home hobbyist markets 
finally  in september  we acquired avid nordic ab  a sweden based distributor of avid products operating in the nordic and benelux regions of europe 
this acquisition allows us to directly serve customers in this region 
we previously had no ownership interest in avid nordic ab 
we generally derive approximately half of our revenues from customers outside the united states 
this business is  for the most part  transacted through international subsidiaries and generally in the currency of the end user customers 
therefore  we are exposed to the risk that changes in foreign currency could materially impact  either positively or adversely  our revenues  net income loss and cash flow 
to hedge against the foreign exchange exposure of certain forecasted receivables  payables and cash balances of our foreign subsidiaries  we enter into short term foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
we record gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on these contracts in results of operations  offsetting remeasurement gains and losses on the related assets and liabilities 
the success of this hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are over or understated during the periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we regularly re evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for product returns and exchanges  allowance for bad debts  the valuation of inventories  goodwill and other intangible assets  income tax assets  and reserves for recourse under financing transactions 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies most significantly affect the portrayal of our financial condition and involve our most difficult and subjective judgments 
revenue recognition and allowances for product returns and exchanges we recognize revenue from sales of products upon receipt of a signed purchase order or contract and product shipment to distributors or end users  provided that collection is reasonably assured  the fee is fixed or determinable  and all other revenue recognition criteria of sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  and securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  are met 
within our video segment and for much of our audio segment  we follow the guidance of sop for revenue recognition since our products and services are software related 
however  for certain offerings in our audio segment  software is incidental to the delivered products and services 
for these products  we record revenue based on satisfying the criteria in sab no 
in connection with many of our product sale transactions  customers typically purchase a one year maintenance and support agreement 
we recognize revenue from maintenance contracts on a ratable basis over their term 
we recognize revenue from training  installation or other services as the services are performed 
we use the residual method to recognize revenues when an order includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered element  typically maintenance and support  is deferred and the remaining portion of the total arrangement fee is recognized as revenue related to the delivered element 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  we defer all revenues and only recognize them when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
fair value is typically based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately to customers 
however  in certain transactions  fair value is based on the renewal price of the undelivered element that is granted as a contractual right to the customer 
our current pricing practices are influenced primarily by product type  purchase volume  term and customer location 
we review services revenues sold separately and corresponding renewal rates on a periodic basis and update  when appropriate  our fair value for such services used for revenue recognition purposes to ensure that it reflects our recent pricing experience 
in most cases  our products do not require significant production  modification or customization of software 
installation of the products is generally routine  requires minimal effort and is not typically performed by us 
however  a growing number of transactions  those typically involving orders from end users for a significant number of products for a single customer site  such as news broadcasters  require that we perform an installation effort that we deem to be complex and non routine 
in these situations  we do not recognize revenue for either the products shipped or the installation services until the installation is complete 
in addition  if such orders include a customer acceptance provision  no revenue is recognized until the customer s acceptance of the products and services has been received or the acceptance period has lapsed 
telephone support  enhancements and unspecified upgrades typically are provided at no additional charge during the product s initial warranty period generally between days and twelve months  which precedes commencement of the maintenance contracts 
we defer the fair value of this support period and recognize the related revenue ratably over the initial warranty period 
we also from time to time offer certain customers free upgrades or specified future products or enhancements 
for each of these elements that is undelivered at the time of product shipment  we defer the fair value of the specified upgrade  product or enhancement and recognize that revenue only upon later delivery or at the time at which the remaining contractual terms relating to the upgrade have been satisfied 
in  approximately of our revenue was derived from indirect sales channels  including authorized resellers and distributors 
within our video segment  our resellers and distributors are generally not granted rights to return products to us after purchase  and actual product returns from them have been insignificant to date 
however  distributors of our avid xpress dv  avid xpress pro and avid mojo product lines have a contractual right to return a percentage of prior quarter purchases 
the return provision for these distributors has not had a material impact on our results of operations 
in contrast  some channel partners  particularly those who resell our audio products  are offered limited rights of return  stock rotation and price protection 
channel partners within our audio segment are granted return rights to return or exchange products on a case by case basis but are not provided a contractual right to do so 
in compliance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  we record a provision for estimated returns and other allowances  as a reduction of revenues  in the same period that related revenues are recorded 
management estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing and maintaining a sales allowance for expected returns and other credits 
in making such estimates  we analyze historical returns and credits and the amounts of products held by major resellers  and consider the impact of new product introductions  changes in customer demand  current economic conditions  and other known factors 
we maintain a rolling history of returns on a product by product basis and analyze returns and credits by product category 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our estimates of potential product returns or other reseller credits prove to be materially different from actual experience 
at the time of a sale transaction  we make an assessment of the collectibility of the amount due from the customer 
revenue is recognized only if we are reasonably assured that collection will occur 
in making this assessment  we consider customer credit worthiness and historical payment experience 
if it is determined from the outset of the arrangement that collection is not reasonably assured based upon our credit review process  revenue is recognized on a cash collected basis to the extent that the other criteria of sop and sab are satisfied 
at the outset of the arrangement  we assess whether the fee associated with the order is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties 
in assessing whether the fee is fixed or determinable  we consider the payment terms of the transaction  our collection experience in similar transactions without making concessions  and our involvement  if any  in third party financing transactions  among other factors 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized only as payments become due from the customer  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if a significant portion of the fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are generally  but can be up to  days after the invoice date  we evaluate whether we have sufficient history of successfully collecting past transactions with similar terms 
if that collection history is successful  then revenue is recognized upon delivery of the products  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
we record as revenue all amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling costs and record the actual shipping costs as a component of cost of revenues 
we record reimbursements received from customers for out of pocket expenses as revenue  with related costs recorded as cost of revenues 
with respect to sales of solutions  we are able to invoice the customer under a billing plan in advance of providing products and services or maintenance and support 
in these instances  we record invoiced amounts and cash payments received prior to revenue recognition as deferred revenue 
allowance for bad debts and reserves for recourse under financing transactions we maintain allowances for estimated bad debt losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments for products or services 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowances  we analyze accounts receivable balances  historical bad debt experience  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
we provide third party  lease financing options to many of our customers 
avid is not generally a party to the leases  however  during the terms of these leases  which are generally three years  we remain liable for any unpaid principal balance upon default by the end user  but such liability is limited in the aggregate 
see footnote i to our consolidated financial statements in item we record revenue from these transactions upon the shipment of our products since we believe that our collection experience with similar transactions supports our assessment that the fee is fixed or determinable 
we have operated these programs for over nine years and to date defaults under the program have consistently ranged between and 
we maintain reserves for estimated recourse losses under this financing program based on these historical default rates 
while we have experienced insignificant losses from defaults to date under this program  deterioration in the financial condition of our customers who participate in the program could require additional reserves 
inventories inventory in the digital media market  including our inventory  is subject to rapid technological change or obsolescence 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and write down inventory to its realizable value to reflect estimated obsolescence or unmarketability based upon assumptions about future inventory demand generally for the following twelve months  and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than estimates by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
business combinations when we acquire new businesses  we use the purchase method of accounting as required by sfas no 
 business combinations 
we allocate the purchase price of businesses acquired to the assets  including intangible assets  acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values  with any amount in excess of such allocations designated as goodwill 
significant management judgments and assumptions are required in determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities  particularly acquired intangible assets 
for example  it is necessary to estimate the portion of development efforts that are associated with technology that is in process and has no alternative future use 
the valuation of purchased intangible assets is based upon estimates of the future performance and cash flows from the acquired business 
if different assumptions are used  it could materially impact the purchase price allocation and our financial position and results of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets we assess the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets on at least an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or component thereof will be sold or otherwise disposed of  significant underperformance relative to the historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  a reduction of our market capitalization relative to our net book value and other such circumstances 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we no longer amortize goodwill and certain intangible assets 
the goodwill impairment test prescribed by sfas no 
requires us to identify reporting units and to determine estimates of the fair values of our reporting units as of the date we test for impairment 
we have two reporting units that are currently the same as our operating segments  video and audio  as described in note n of notes to consolidated financial statements 
both of our reporting units include goodwill 
in the goodwill impairment analysis  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and its implied fair value 
in determining the fair values of our reporting units  we first estimate the fair value of the total company by reference to the quoted market price of our stock and then allocate this fair value among our reporting units using a discounted cash flow valuation model 
this model focuses primarily on estimates of future revenues and profits for each reporting unit 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and industry data 
we completed our annual impairment tests as of the end of the fourth quarter of each year and concluded that no impairment charge was required 
if future events cause the reporting units fair value to decline below its carrying value  an impairment charge may be required 
in the identifiable intangibles impairment analysis  the fair value of each asset is compared to its carrying value 
if the asset s carrying value is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value  we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value 
the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
we analyzed certain of our identifiable intangible assets for impairment as of the end of the fourth quarter of and found some of them to be impaired as described in footnote f to our consolidated financial statements in item income tax assets we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits  operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we regularly review deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into consideration such factors as historical losses after deductions for stock compensation  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires us to record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
based on the level of deferred tax assets as of december   the level of historical us losses after deductions for stock compensation  and the level of outstanding stock options  which we anticipate will generate significant us tax deductions in the future  we have determined that the uncertainty regarding the realization of these assets is sufficient to warrant the continued establishment of a full valuation allowance against the us net deferred tax assets 
in the year ended december   we removed the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets in our irish manufacturing operations 
this resulted in a non cash million tax benefit recorded through our provision for income taxes 
the decision to remove the valuation allowance was based on the conclusion that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset in ireland would be realized 
our assessment of the valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets could change in the future based upon our levels of pre tax income and other tax related adjustments 
removal of the valuation allowance in whole or in part would result in a non cash reduction in the provision for income taxes during the period of removal 
in addition  because a portion of the valuation allowance as of december  was established to reserve certain deferred tax assets resulting from the exercise of employee stock options  in accordance with sfas no 
 removal of the valuation allowance related to these assets would result in a credit to additional paid in capital within stockholders equity rather than the provision for income taxes 
if the valuation allowance of million as of december  were to be removed in its entirety  an million non cash reduction in income tax expense and a million credit to paid in capital would be recorded in the period of removal 
to the extent no valuation allowance is established for our deferred tax assets in future periods  future financial statements would reflect a non cash increase in our provision for income taxes 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated for the year ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development marketing and selling general and administrative restructuring and other costs  net amortization of intangible assets impairment of intangible assets total operating expenses operating income interest and other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income net revenues our net revenues are derived mainly from the sales of computer based digital  nonlinear media editing systems and related peripherals  licensing of related software  and sales of related software maintenance contracts 
this market has been  and we expect it to continue to be  highly competitive 
a significant portion of these revenues is generated by sales near the end of each quarter  which can impact our ability to accurately forecast revenues on a quarterly basis 
increasingly  revenues are also being derived from sales of solutions encompassing multiple products and networking capabilities that enable users to share and manage media throughout a project or organization 
such solution sales may include training and installation services  as well as workflow management assistance  to be provided by us or a third party 
depending upon the complexity of the arrangement and the level of our involvement  the revenues resulting from these solution sales may be deferred for one or more quarters while the services are being performed 
net revenues increased  from million in to million  in revenues in our video business increased million or  to million from million  while revenues in our audio business grew by million or  to million from million 
we estimate that approximately or million of the growth in the video segment during relates to increased sales volume of our products and services  including a full year of sales of the avid dna family of products released during the second and third quarters of this increased volume growth was partially offset or million by lower average selling prices of our various products despite favorable foreign currency exchange rates  especially with respect to the euro

for the audio segment  the revenue growth in is primarily the result of higher average selling prices of our products  including the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes 
net revenues derived through indirect channels were approximately for compared to for and for the increase in direct selling from to was due primarily to the growth in sales to our broadcast customers  which generally require a longer selling cycle with more direct support 
we expect sales to broadcast customers will be an area of continued revenue growth in the future 
international sales ie  sales to customers outside the united states accounted for of our net revenues  compared to for and for international sales increased by million or in compared to and increased by million or in compared to the increase in international sales in occurred in europe and asia  with the impact of currency translation and the acquisition of m audio being factors 
the increase in international sales in occurred principally in europe  with the impact of currency translation being a factor 
gross margin cost of revenues consists primarily of costs associated with the procurement of components  post sales customer support costs related to maintenance contract revenue and other services  the assembly  testing  and distribution of finished products  warehousing  and royalties for third party software included in our products 
the resulting gross margin fluctuates based on factors such as the mix of products sold  the cost and proportion of third party hardware and software included in the systems sold  the offering of product upgrades  price discounts and other sales promotion programs  the distribution channels through which products are sold  the timing of new product introductions  sales of aftermarket hardware products such as disk drives  and currency exchange rate fluctuations 
our gross margin increased to in from in  which had increased from in the gross margin increase in reflects primarily a favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on revenue  especially with respect to the euro 
we also achieved reduced material and manufacturing overhead costs in the video segment in as compared to the gross margin increase in primarily reflects a positive impact from higher average selling prices of our products  which in was particularly impacted by favorable foreign currency exchange rates  especially with respect to the euro 
average selling prices also include the impact of price changes  discounting  and mix higher or lower end of products sold 
we also achieved reduced material and manufacturing overhead costs in the video segment in as compared to research and development research and development expenses increased by million or in compared to and by million or in compared to the increase in expenditures in was primarily due to higher personnel related costs partly due to the acquisitions of nxn and m audio during as well as to our bonus plan 
these costs were somewhat offset by reduced consulting fees 
the increase in expenditures in was primarily due to higher personnel related costs  in particular accrued expenses associated with our bonus plan 
these costs were somewhat offset by reductions in other spending categories

various marketing programs and increased advertising also contributed to the increase 
the increase in was primarily due to higher personnel related costs  including salaries and related taxes and benefits as well as expenses associated with our bonus plan and commissions expense due to higher revenues 
we also had higher net foreign exchange losses specifically  remeasurement gains and losses on net monetary assets denominated in foreign currencies  offset by hedging gains and losses  which are included in marketing and selling expenses  in these increases were partially offset by lower marketing expenses such as advertising and direct mailings

restructuring and other costs restructuring activity in was primarily related to paying down existing obligations on vacated facilities 
additionally  in september  we recorded a charge of million to reflect the decrease in rent to be received from one of our subtenants and reversed a charge of million associated with unutilized space in tewksbury 
our restructuring actions during consisted of severance and facility charges made to increase efficiencies and reduce expenses  and a revision to a previous restructuring charge recorded on unutilized space 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a charge of million for employee terminations and million for unutilized space in santa monica  california that included a write off of leasehold improvements of million 
also during  we recorded charges of million related to a revision of our estimate of the timing and amount of future sublease income associated with the daly city facility discussed below based on working with a real estate broker during the year to attempt to sublease the space 
in december  we recorded a charge of approximately million in connection with vacating excess space in our daly city  california  tewksbury  massachusetts  and montreal  canada facilities 
the tewksbury charge of million was a revision of our estimate related to the august restructuring action discussed below  based on our attempts to sublet the related space during the remaining portion of the charge for daly city and montreal was the result of our ceasing to use a portion of each facility in december and hiring real estate brokers to assist in finding subtenants 
we believe the daly city charge of million reflected a depressed real estate market in the area 
during  we implemented various restructuring plans to decrease costs through the consolidation of operations and the reduction of approximately jobs worldwide 
in connection with these plans  we recorded charges to operating expenses totaling million 
the restructuring charges included approximately million for severance and related costs of terminated employees and million for facility vacancy costs  of which million represented non cash charges relating to the disposition of leasehold improvements that were abandoned upon vacating the related properties in and these restructuring actions were expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately million  and management believes that these savings were achieved 
in connection with these and prior plans  we made cash payments in of million related to personnel severance related costs and million related to vacated facilities 
in  we made severance related payments of million  facilities related payments of million and wrote off million of leasehold improvements 
in  we made severance related payments of million and facilities related payments of million 
in  we made facilities related payments of million 
as of december   we have an aggregate obligation under leases for which we have vacated the underlying facilities of approximately million  including facilities in daly city  california  tewksbury  massachusetts  london  england and montreal  canada 
we have a remaining restructuring accrual balance for vacated facilities at december  of million  which represents the difference between this aggregate obligation and expected future sublease income under actual or estimated potential sublease agreements

amortization of and impairment of intangible assets in august  we acquired m audio  a leading provider of digital audio and midi solutions for electronic musicians and audio professionals  for cash  net of cash acquired  of million and stock and stock options with a fair value of million 
as part of the purchase accounting allocation  we recorded million of identifiable intangible assets  consisting of completed technologies  customer relationships  a trade name and a non compete covenant 
the unamortized balance of the identifiable intangible assets relating to this acquisition was million at december  in september  we acquired avid nordic ab for cash  net of cash acquired  of euro million million 
as part of the purchase price allocation  we recorded million of identifiable intangible assets consisting solely of customer relationships 
the unamortized balance was million at december  in january  we acquired nxn software gmbh  a leading provider of asset and production management systems specifically targeted for the entertainment and computer graphics industries  for cash consideration of euro million million  less cash acquired 
as part of the purchase accounting allocation  we recorded million of identifiable intangible assets  consisting of completed technologies  customer relationships and a trade name 
in december  the customer relationships and the trade name were analyzed in accordance with fas  and were determined to be impaired 
see note f to our consolidated financial statements in item we recorded an impairment charge of million for the quarter ended december  the remaining unamortized balance of the identifiable intangible assets relating to this acquisition was million at december  from to  we recorded intangible assets as we acquired the following companies or their assets rocket network  inc and bomb factory digital  inc in  iknowledge  inc 
in  inews  llc in  and the motion factory  inc in in connection with these acquisitions  we allocated million to identifiable intangible assets consisting of completed technologies and work force  and million to goodwill 
as of january   in connection with the adoption of sfas  we reclassified million of the previously recorded assembled work force intangible to goodwill and  as a result  ceased amortizing this amount 
the unamortized balance of the identifiable intangible assets relating to these acquisitions was million at december  included in the operating results for  and is amortization of these intangible assets of million  million and million  respectively 
the increased levels of amortization primarily reflect the addition of the m audio assets acquired in august and the nxn assets acquired in january the unamortized balance of the identifiable intangible assets relating to all acquisitions was million at december  we expect amortization of these intangible assets to be approximately million in  million in and million in other income and expense  net other income and expense  net  generally consists of interest income  interest expense and equity in income of non consolidated companies 
during  other income and expense  net  decreased million from million of income on a net basis in to million in this decrease was due to a charge in of million related to the settlement of a lawsuit  which was partly offset by increased interest income earned on higher average cash and investment balances 
during  other income and expense  net  increased million from million in this increase was due to increased interest income earned on higher average cash and investment balances  as well as to the absence in of a impairment charge recorded in to write down an investment in an unconsolidated entity accounted for under the cost method 
provision for benefit from income taxes we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
is an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we account for investment tax credits as a reduction of income taxes of the year in which the credit arises 
our effective tax rate was   and  respectively  for   and the tax rate in each year is significantly affected by net changes in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into consideration such factors as historical losses after deductions for stock compensation  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
sfas no 
requires us to record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
based on the level of deferred tax assets as of december   the level of historical us losses after deductions for stock compensation  and the level of outstanding stock options  which we anticipate will generate significant us tax deductions in the future  we have determined that the uncertainty regarding the realization of these assets is sufficient to warrant the continued establishment of a full valuation allowance against the us net deferred tax assets 
in the quarter ended december   we removed the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets in our irish manufacturing operations 
this resulted in a non cash million tax benefit reflected in the rate indicated above 
the decision to remove the valuation allowance was based on the conclusion that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset in ireland would be realized 
due to the removal of the valuation allowance  in future periods  we will have a non cash increase to provision for income taxes related to our irish operations 
excluding the impact of the valuation allowance  our effective tax rate would have been for and for these rates differ from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to income in foreign jurisdictions  which have lower tax rates 
excluding the impact of the valuation allowance  our effective tax rate would have been for this differs from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to state taxes  while savings due to the us federal research tax credit more than offset a higher level of taxes from our foreign subsidiaries  which are taxed at different rates 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations to date through both private and public sales of equity securities  including stock option exercises from our employee stock plans  as well as through cash flows from operations 
as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in and million in in each case  cash generated from operating activities primarily reflects net income after adjustment for depreciation and amortization 
in addition  cash flows reflect cash generated through increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets 
in  cash flows also reflect cash generated through increases in deferred revenues and accrued expenses  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable 
in  cash flows also reflect cash generated through a decrease in accounts receivable and increases in accounts payable and deferred revenues 
this was partially offset by an increase in inventories during at december  and  we held inventory in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
these balances include stockroom  spares and demonstration equipment inventories at various locations  and inventory at customer sites related to shipments for which we have not yet recognized revenue 
we review these balances regularly for excess quantities or potential obsolescence and make appropriate adjustments to write down the inventories to reflect their estimated realizable value 
of the million increase in inventories from december  to  approximately million relates to the acquisition of m audio 
accounts receivable increased by million to million at december  from million at december   driven primarily by the year over year increase in net revenues 
these balances are net of allowances for sales returns  bad debts and customer rebates  all of which we estimate and record based on historical experience 
days sales outstanding in accounts receivable increased from days at december  to days at december  net cash flow used in investing activities was million in  compared to million in and million in in  we had net sales of marketable securities in the amount of million 
the marketable securities in which we invest our excess cash typically include corporate obligations  asset backed securities  commercial paper  taxable municipal obligations and us treasuries and other governmental obligations 
we also expended cash of million in for the acquisitions of m audio  nxn  and avid nordic and the final payment for bomb factory digital 
we purchased million of property and equipment during  compared to million during  and million in purchases of property and equipment in both and were primarily of computer hardware and software to support research and development activities and our information systems 
our capital spending program for is currently expected to be approximately million  including purchases of hardware and software to support activities in the research and development  information systems and manufacturing areas  as well as for facilities renovations 
however  this amount could increase in the event we enter into strategic business acquisitions or for other reasons 
during  we made a cash payment of approximately million to acquire selected assets of iknowledge  inc as part of the purchase agreement  we were required to make certain contingent cash payments  depending upon the future revenues of the products acquired from iknowledge through december as of december   contingent payments paid to date or owed were immaterial 
in connection with the acquisition of the motion factory in  we might have been required to make future contingent cash payments limited in the aggregate to million  depending upon future revenues and or gross margin levels through december of the products including technology we acquired from the motion factory 
no contingent payments were paid or are owed through december  during  and  we generated cash of approximately million  million and million  respectively  from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
in  we made a prepayment in full satisfaction of a million note to microsoft 
in connection with restructuring efforts during and prior periods  as well as with the identification in and of excess space in various locations  we have cash obligations of approximately million under leases for which we have vacated the underlying facilities 
we have an associated restructuring accrual of million at december  representing losses to be incurred or expected to be incurred on subleases of space or lease vacancies 
these payments will be made over the remaining terms of the leases  which have varying expiration dates through  unless we are able to negotiate an earlier termination 
all restructuring related payments will be funded through working capital 
see notes i and m to our consolidated financial statements 
our cash requirements vary depending upon factors such as our planned growth  capital expenditures  the possible acquisition of businesses or technologies complementary to our business and obligations under past restructuring programs 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
in the event we require additional financing  we believe that we will be able to obtain such financing  however  there can be no assurance that we would be successful in doing so  or that we could do so on favorable terms 
contractual and commercial obligations including off balance sheet arrangements the following table sets forth future payments that we are obligated to make  as of december   under existing debt agreements  leases and other arrangements in thousands less than after total year years years years capital lease obligations operating leases      unconditional purchase obligations   other contractual arrangements that may result in cash payments or the issuance of avid stock or options to purchase avid stock consist of the following in thousands total less than year years transactions with recourse   stand by letter of credit   contingent consideration for acquisitions    through a third party  we offer lease financing options to our customers 
during the terms of these financing arrangements  which are generally for three years  we remain liable for any unpaid principal balance in the event of a default on the lease by the end user 
our liability is limited in the aggregate based on a percentage of initial amounts funded or  in certain cases  amounts of unpaid balances 
as of december   our maximum exposure under this program was million 
we have a stand by letter of credit at a bank that is used as a security deposit in connection with our daly city  california office space lease 
in the event of a default on our lease the landlord would  as of december   be eligible to draw against this letter of credit to a maximum of million  subject to an annual reduction of approximately million but not below million 
the letter of credit will remain at million throughout the remaining lease period  which runs through september as of december   we were not in default of this lease 
we conduct our business globally and  consequently  our results from operations are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we enter into forward exchange contracts  which generally have one month maturities  to reduce exposures associated with the foreign exchange exposures of certain forecasted third party and intercompany receivables  payables and cash balances 
at december   there were no open forward exchange contracts in place 
as part of the purchase agreements of both m audio and avid nordic ab  avid may be required to make additional payments of up to million contingent upon the operating results of m audio through december  and of avid nordic through august  see note f to our consolidated financial statements in item recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 which is the result of its efforts to converge us accounting standards for inventories with international accounting standards 
sfas no 
requires idle facility expenses  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage costs to be recognized as current period charges 
it also requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
on december   the fasb released sfas no 
r 
this new accounting standard requires all forms of stock compensation  including stock options issued to employees  to be reflected as an expense in the company s financial statements 
public companies must adopt the standard by their first fiscal period beginning after june  sfas no 
r allows three alternative methods of transitioning to the standard modified prospective application mpa  without restatement of prior interim periods in the year of adoption  mpa with restatement of prior interim periods in the year of adoption  or modified retrospective application 
the company intends to use the mpa without restatement alternative and to apply the revised standard beginning in the quarter ending september  although the company has not finalized its analysis  it expects that the adoption of the revised standard will result in higher operating expenses and lower earnings per share 
see note b to our consolidated financial statements for the pro forma impact on net income loss and income loss per common share as if we had historically applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
to stock based employee awards 
on october   the president signed the american jobs creation act of the act 
the act creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
although the deduction is subject to a number of limitations and significant uncertainty remains as to how to interpret numerous provisions in the act  as of december   the company believes that it has the information necessary to make an informed decision on the impact of the act 
based on the information available  the company has determined that its cash position in the us is sufficient to fund anticipated needs 
the company also believes that the repatriation of income earned abroad would result in significant foreign withholding taxes that otherwise would not have been incurred as well as additional us tax liabilities that may not be sufficiently offset by foreign tax credits 
therefore  the company does not currently plan to repatriate any income earned abroad 
these initial findings could change based on clarification of the rules and changes in facts and circumstances of the company s operations and or cash requirements in the us certain factors that may affect future results some of the statements in this form k relating to our future performance constitute forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements are based upon management s current expectations and involve known and unknown risks 
realization of any of these risks may cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in the forward looking statements 
certain of these risks are as follows poor global economic conditions could adversely affect demand for our products and the financial condition of our suppliers  distributors and resellers 
the revenue growth and profitability of our business depends primarily on the overall demand for our products 
if global economic conditions worsen  demand for our products may weaken  as could the financial health of our suppliers  distributors and resellers  and our business and results of operations could suffer 
our performance will depend in part on continued market acceptance of our digital nonlinear editing products 
we continue to introduce new digital non linear products based on our digital nonlinear accelerator architecture  including upgrades and enhancements to our media composer adrenaline and newscutter adrenaline systems  as well as avid xpress pro with avid mojo and avid ds nitris hardware 
we will need to continue to focus marketing and sales efforts on educating potential customers and our resellers about the uses and benefits of these products 
the future success of certain of these products  such as avid ds nitris  which enable high definition production  will also depend on demand for high definition content and appliances  such as television sets and monitors  that utilize the high definition standard 
in addition  there are several other risks involved with offering new products in general  including  without limitation  the possibility of defects or errors  failure to meet customer expectations  delays in shipping new products and the introduction of similar products by our competitors 
at the same time  the introduction and transition to new products could have a negative impact on the market for our existing products  which could adversely affect our revenues and business 
the broadcast market is large  widely dispersed  and highly competitive  and we may not be successful in growing our customer base or predicting customer demand in this market 
we are continuing to enhance our presence in the digital broadcast market and have augmented our newscutter product offering with the avid unity for news products  and other server  newsroom  and browser products 
the broadcast market is distinguished from our traditional video business in that turnkey  fully integrated  complex solutions including the configuration of unique workflows  rather than discrete point products  are frequently required by the customer 
success in this market will require  among other things  creating and implementing compelling solutions and developing a strong  loyal customer base 
in addition  large  complex broadcast orders often require us to devote significant sales  engineering  manufacturing  installation  and support resources to ensure their successful and timely fulfillment 
as the broadcast market converts from analog to digital  our strategy has been to build our broadcast solutions team in response to customer demand 
to the extent that customer demand for our broadcast solutions exceeds our expectations  we may encounter difficulties in the short run meeting our customers needs 
meanwhile  our competitors may devote greater resources to the broadcast market than we do  or may be able to leverage their market presence more effectively 
if we are unsuccessful in expanding our share of this digital broadcast market or in predicting and satisfying customer demand  our business and revenues could be adversely affected 
a portion of our revenue is dependent on sales of large  complex solutions 
we expect sales of large  complex solutions to continue to constitute a material portion of our net revenue  particularly as news stations convert from analog  or tape based  processes to digital formats 
our quarterly and annual revenues could fluctuate if o sales to one or more of our customers are delayed or are not completed within a given quarter  o the contract terms preclude us from recognizing revenue during that quarter  o news stations migrations to networked digital infrastructure slows down  o we are unable to complete complex customer installations on schedule  o our customers reduce their capital investments in our products in response to slowing economic growth  and o any of our large customers terminate their relationship with us or significantly reduce the amount of business they do with us 
when we acquire other companies or businesses  we become subject to potential events or circumstances that could hurt our business 
we periodically acquire other companies or businesses 
for example  in january  we acquired nxn software gmbh  a company that manufactures asset and production management systems specifically targeted for the entertainment and computer graphics industries  and in august  we acquired midiman  inc d b a m audio  a leading provider of digital audio and midi solutions for electronic musicians and audio professionals 
the risks associated with such acquisitions include  among others o the difficulty of assimilating the operations  policies and personnel of the target companies  o the failure to realize anticipated returns on investment  cost savings and synergies  o the diversion of management s time and attention  o the dilution existing stockholders may experience if we issue shares of our common stock or other rights to purchase our common stock as consideration in the acquisition  o the potential loss of key employees of the target company  o the difficulty in complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations  o the impairment of relationships with customers or suppliers  o the risks associated with contingent payments and earnouts  o the possibility of incurring debt and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  and o unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence process  which may include product quality issues and legal contingencies 
such acquisitions often involve significant transaction related costs and could cause disruption to normal operations 
in the future  we may also make debt or equity investments 
if so  we may fail to realize anticipated returns on such investments 
if we are unable to overcome or mitigate these risks  they could undermine our business and lower our operating results 
the markets for our products are competitive  and we expect competition to intensify in the future 
the digital video and  audio markets are highly competitive  with limited barriers to entry  and are characterized by pressure to reduce prices  incorporate new features  and accelerate the release of new products 
some of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  distribution  support  and marketing resources than we do 
such competitors may use these resources to lower their product costs  allowing them to reduce prices to levels at which we could not operate profitably 
delays or difficulties in product development and introduction may also harm our business 
in addition to price  our products must also compete favorably with our competitors products in terms of reliability  performance  ease of use  range of features  product enhancements  reputation and training 
if we are unable to compete effectively in our target markets  our business and results of operations could suffer 
new product announcements by our competitors and by us also could have the effect of reducing customer demand for our existing products 
new product introductions require us to devote time and resources to training our sales channels in product features and target customers  with the temporary result that the sales channels may have less time to devote to selling our products 
in addition  our introduction of new products and expansion into new markets can put us into competition with companies with whom we formerly collaborated 
to the extent such companies discontinue their alliances with avid  it could have a negative impact on our business 
our products are complex  and may contain errors or defects resulting from such complexity 
as we continue to enhance and expand our product offerings  our products have grown increasingly complex and  despite extensive testing and quality control  may contain errors or defects 
such errors or defects could cause us to issue corrective releases and could result in loss of revenues  delay of revenue recognition  increased product returns  lack of market acceptance  and damage to our reputation 
we have a significant share of the audio market  and therefore our growth in this market will depend in part on our ability to successfully introduce new products 
products from our digidesign division have captured a significant portion of the audio market  due in large part to a series of successful product introductions 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to offer  on a timely and cost effective basis  new audio products and enhancements of our existing audio products 
this can be a complex and uncertain process  and we could experience design  manufacturing  marketing  or other difficulties that delay or prevent the introduction of new or enhanced products  or the integration of acquired products  which  in turn  could harm our business 
a component of m audio s business strategy is to expand into the highly competitive consumer market channel  a sales channel in which we have limited experience 
historically  a significant portion of our audio revenues has been derived from sales to professional musicians and studios 
m audio is currently expanding its sales channel to include sales through the broader consumer market channel 
members of m audio s senior staff have experience in this market  but our overall experience addressing the consumer market channel is limited  and the process of developing a channel for non specialty stores and establishing our products in these stores will be difficult 
while we are not anticipating that a material portion of our revenues will come through this channel in the near term  there are costs related to pursuing the consumer market channel which are  to a large extent  fixed 
as a result  we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall  which would harm our operating results 
also  to the extent we increase sales of our audio products through the consumer market channel  we expect to experience greater seasonality in sales of such products 
typically  sales of consumer electronics and software increase in the second half of the year  reaching their peak during the year end holiday season 
our use of independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development and manufacturing activities could expose us to risks that could adversely impact our revenues 
independent firms and contractors  some of whom are located in other countries  perform some of our product development and manufacturing activities 
we generally own the software developed by these contractors 
the use of independent firms and contractors  especially those located abroad  could expose us to risks related to governmental regulation including tax regulation  intellectual property ownership and rights  exchange rate fluctuation  political instability and unrest  natural disasters  and other risks  which could adversely impact our revenues 
an interruption of our supply of certain products or key components from our sole source suppliers  or a price increase in such products or components  could hurt our business 
we are dependent on a number of specific suppliers for certain products and key components of our products 
we purchase these sole source products and components pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time 
we generally do not carry significant inventories of these sole source products and components and have no guaranteed supply arrangements 
if any of our sole source vendors should fail to produce such products or to supply or enhance such components  it could imperil our supply and our ability to continue selling and servicing products that use these components 
similarly  if any of our sole source vendors should encounter technical  operating or financial difficulties  it could threaten our supply of these products or components 
while we believe that alternative sources for these products and components could be developed  or our products could be redesigned to permit the use of alternative components  an interruption of our supply could damage our business and negatively affect our operating results 
our gross profit margin varies from product to product depending primarily on the proportion and cost of third party hardware included in each product 
from time to time  we add functionality and features to our products 
if we effect such additions through the use of more  or more costly  third party hardware  and are not able to increase the price of such products to offset these increased costs  our gross profit margin on these products could decrease and our operating results could be adversely affected 
we rely on third party software for some of our products and if we are unable to use or integrate such software  our product and service development may be delayed 
we rely on certain software that we license from third parties  including software that is bundled with our products and sold to end users and software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions 
these third party software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  and the software may not be appropriately supported  maintained or enhanced by the licensors 
the loss of licenses to  or inability to support  maintain and enhance any such software  could result in increased costs  or in delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software could be developed  identified  licensed and integrated  which would likely harm our business 
qualifying and supporting our products on multiple computer platforms is time consuming and expensive 
our software engineers devote significant time and effort to qualify and support our products on various computer platforms  including most notably  microsoft and apple platforms 
computer platform modifications and upgrades require additional time to be spent to ensure that our products will function properly 
to the extent that the current configuration of the qualified and supported platforms changes or we need to qualify and support new platforms  we could be required to expend valuable engineering resources  which could adversely affect our operating results 
our operating results are dependent on several unpredictable factors 
the revenue and gross profit from our products depend on many factors  including o mix of products sold  o cost and proportion of third party hardware and software included in such products  o product distribution channels  o acceptance of our new product introductions  o product offers and platform upgrades  o price discounts and sales promotion programs  o volume of sales of aftermarket hardware products  o costs of swapping or fixing products released to the market with defects  o provisions for inventory obsolescence  o competitive pressure on product prices  o costs incurred in connection with solution sales  which typically have longer selling and implementation cycles  and o timing of delivery of solutions to customers 
changes in any of these factors could affect our operating results 
our international operations expose us to significant exchange fluctuations  regulatory  intellectual property and other risks which could harm our operating results 
we generally derive approximately half of our revenues from customers outside of the united states 
this business is  for the most part  transacted through international subsidiaries and generally in the currency of the end user customers 
therefore  we are exposed to the risks that changes in foreign currency could adversely impact our revenues  net income loss  and cash flow 
to hedge against the foreign exchange exposure of certain forecasted receivables  payables and cash balances of our foreign subsidiaries  we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
the success of our hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are over or understated during the periods of currency volatility  we could experience currency gains or losses 
other risks inherent in our international operations include changes in regulatory practices  environmental laws  tax laws  trade restrictions and tariffs  longer collection cycles for accounts receivable  and greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property 
our operating costs are tied to projections of future revenues  which may differ from actual results 
our operating expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations of future revenues 
such future revenues are difficult to predict 
a significant portion of our business occurs near the end of each quarter  which can impact our ability to precisely forecast revenues on a quarterly basis 
further  we are generally unable to reduce quarterly operating expense levels rapidly in the event that quarterly revenue levels fail to meet internal expectations 
therefore  if quarterly revenue levels fail to meet internal expectations upon which expense levels are based  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
terrorism  acts of war  and other catastrophic events may seriously harm our business 
terrorism  acts of war  or other catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our employees  facilities  suppliers  distributors  resellers or customers  which could significantly impact our revenue and operating results 
the increasing presence of these threats has created many economic and political uncertainties that could adversely affect our business and stock price in ways that cannot be predicted 
we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorism  acts of war  and other conflicts and events 
if we fail to maintain strong relationships with our resellers  distributors  and suppliers  our ability to successfully deploy our products may be harmed 
we sell many of our video products and services  and substantially all of our audio products and services  indirectly through resellers and distributors 
in our audio segment  a few distributors account for a significant portion of the revenue from sales of our audio products 
the loss of one or more key distributors could reduce our revenues 
the resellers and distributors of our video segment products typically purchase avid software and avid specific hardware from us  and third party components from various other vendors  in order to produce complete systems for resale 
any disruption to our resellers and distributors  or their third party suppliers  could reduce our revenues 
increasingly  we are distributing our products directly  which could put us in competition with our resellers and distributors and could adversely affect our revenues 
in addition  our resellers could diversify the manufacturers from whom they purchase products to sell to the final end users  which could lead to a weakening of our relationships with our resellers and could adversely affect our revenues 
most of the resellers and distributors of our video products are not granted rights to return products after purchase  and actual product returns from such resellers and distributors have been insignificant to date 
however  our revenue from sales of audio products is generally derived from transactions with distributors and authorized resellers that typically allow limited rights of return  inventory stock rotation and price protection 
accordingly  reserves for estimated returns  exchanges and credits for price protection are recorded as a reduction of revenues upon shipment of the related products to such distributors and resellers  based upon our historical experience 
to date  actual returns have not differed materially from management s estimates 
however  if returns of our audio segment products were to exceed estimated levels  our revenues and operating results could be adversely impacted 
changes in accounting rules could adversely affect our future operating results 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
these principles are subject to interpretation by various governing bodies  including the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission  which promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting regulations 
a change from current accounting regulations  including accounting for stock based compensation  will have a significant effect on our reported financial results 
our future growth could be harmed if we lose the services of certain employees 
our success depends upon the services of a talented and dedicated workforce  including members of our executive team and those in more technical positions 
the loss of the services of one or more key employees could harm our business 
our success also depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled new employees 
competition for such employees is intense in the industries and geographic areas in which we operate 
in the past  we have relied on our ability to grant stock options as one mechanism for recruiting and retaining highly skilled talent 
newly issued accounting regulations which will require us to expense stock options will impair our ability to provide these incentives without incurring compensation costs 
if we are unable to compete successfully for talented employees  our business could suffer 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  our business could be harmed 
our success depends on our ability to effectively manage the growth of our operations 
as a result of our acquisitions and increasing demand for our products and services  the scope of our operations has grown both domestically and internationally 
our management team will face challenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over larger geographic distances 
these challenges include implementing effective operational systems  procedures and controls  as well as training new personnel 
inability to successfully respond to these challenges could have a material adverse effect on the growth of our business 
our websites could subject us to legal claims that could harm our business 
some of our websites provide interactive information and services to our customers 
to the extent that materials may be posted on and or downloaded from these websites and distributed to others  we may be subject to claims for defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  personal injury  or other theories of liability based on the nature  content  publication or distribution of such materials 
in addition  although we have attempted to limit our exposure by contract  we may also be subject to claims for indemnification by end users in the event that the security of our websites is compromised 
as these websites are available on a worldwide basis  they could potentially be subject to a wide variety of international laws 
we could incur substantial costs protecting our intellectual property or defending against a claim of infringement 
our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth depends  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others 
we rely upon a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  and contractual provisions  as well as required hardware components and security keys  to protect our proprietary technology 
however  our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate 
in addition  the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary technology to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
from time to time unauthorized parties have obtained  copied  and used information that we consider proprietary 
policing the unauthorized use of our proprietary technology is costly and time consuming and we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our software exists 
we expect software piracy to be a persistent problem 
we occasionally receive communications suggesting that our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
it is our practice to investigate the factual basis of such communications and negotiate licenses where appropriate 
while it may be necessary or desirable in the future to obtain licenses relating to one or more products or relating to current or future technologies  we may be unable to do so on commercially reasonable terms 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology or unable to negotiate licenses for the use of others intellectual property  our business could be impaired 
we also may be liable to some of our customers for damages that they incur in connection with intellectual property claims 
although we attempt to limit our exposure to liability arising from infringement of third party intellectual property rights in our agreements with customers  we may not always be successful 
if we are required to pay damages to our customers  or indemnify our customers for damages they incur  our business could be harmed 
moreover  even if a particular claim falls outside of our indemnity or warranty obligations to our customers  our customers may be entitled to additional contractual remedies against us 
our association with industry organizations could subject us to litigation 
we are members of several industry organizations  trade associations and standards consortia 
membership in these and similar groups could subject us to litigation as a result of the group s activities 
for example  in connection with our anti piracy program  designed to enforce copyright protection of our software  we are a member of the business software alliance bsa 
from time to time the bsa undertakes litigation against suspected copyright infringers 
these lawsuits could lead to counterclaims alleging improper use of litigation or violation of other local law 
to date  none of these lawsuits or counterclaims have had an adverse effect on our results of operations  but should we become involved in material litigation  our cash flows or financial position could be adversely effected 
compliance with rules and regulations concerning corporate governance has caused our operating expenses to increase and has put additional demands on our management 
the sarbanes oxley act of and the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the nasdaq stock market increase the scope  complexity and cost of our corporate governance  reporting and disclosure practices 
these laws  rules and regulations also may divert management s attention from business operations  increase the cost of obtaining director and officer liability insurance and make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers  key personnel and members of our board of directors 
if we experience problems with our third party leasing program  our revenues could be adversely impacted 
we have an established leasing program with a third party that allows certain of our customers who choose to do so to finance their purchases 
if this program ended abruptly or unexpectedly  some of our customers might be unable to purchase our products unless or until they were able to arrange for alternative financing  and this could adversely impact our revenues 
our stock price may continue to be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has experienced volatility in the past and could continue to fluctuate substantially in the future based upon a number of factors  most of which are beyond our control 
these factors include o changes in our quarterly operating results  o shortfalls in revenues or earnings compared to securities analysts expectations  o changes in analysts recommendations or projections  o fluctuations in investors perceptions of us or our competitors  o shifts in the markets for our products  o development and marketing of products by our competitors  o changes in our relationships with suppliers  distributors  resellers  system integrators  or customers  o a shift in financial markets  and o global macroeconomic conditions 
further  the stock market has experienced volatility with respect to the price of equity securities of high technology companies generally  and this volatility has  at times  appeared to be unrelated to or disproportionate to any of the factors above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk our primary exposures to market risk are financial  including the effect of volatility in currencies on asset and liability positions and revenue and operating expenses of our international subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies  and the effect of fluctuations in interest rates earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities 
foreign currency exchange risk we generally derive nearly half of our revenues from customers outside the united states 
this business is  for the most part  transacted through international subsidiaries and generally in the currency of the end user customers 
therefore  we are exposed to the risks that changes in foreign currency could adversely impact our revenues  net income loss and cash flow 
to hedge against the foreign exchange exposure of certain forecasted receivables  payables and cash balances of our foreign subsidiaries  we enter into short term foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
there are two objectives of our foreign currency forward exchange contract program to offset any foreign exchange currency risk associated with cash receipts expected to be received from our customers over the next day period and to offset the impact of foreign currency exchange on the company s net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
these forward exchange contracts typically mature within days of purchase 
we record gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on these contracts in results of operations  offsetting gains and losses on the related assets and liabilities 
the success of this hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies  and contract rates versus financial statement rates 
to the extent that these forecasts are over or understated during the periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
at december   there were no forward exchange contracts outstanding 
for the year ended december   net losses of million resulting from forward exchange contracts were recorded  which offset net transaction and remeasurement gains of million on the related assets and liabilities 
a hypothetical change in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations  assuming the above mentioned forecast of foreign currency exposure is accurate  because the impact on the forward contracts as a result of a change would at least partially offset the impact on the asset and liability positions of our foreign subsidiaries 
interest rate risk at december   we held million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  including short term corporate obligations  asset backed securities  commercial paper and us and canadian government and government agency obligations 
marketable securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at market value  with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair market value of these instruments due to their short maturity
