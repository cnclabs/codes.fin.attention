item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the company s consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
statements regarding future economic performance  management s plans and objectives  and any statements concerning its assumptions related to the foregoing contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation constitute forward looking statements 
certain factors  which may cause actual results to vary materially from these forward looking statements  accompany such statements or appear elsewhere in this report  including without limitation  the factors disclosed under risk factors 
general sales consist primarily of charges to customers for delivery services and weekly or monthly charges for recurring services  such as facilities management 
sales are recognized when the service is performed 
the yield value per transaction for a particular service is dependent upon a number of factors including size and weight of articles transported  distance transported  special handling requirements  requested delivery time and local market conditions 
generally  articles of greater weight transported over longer distances and those that require special handling produce higher yields 
cost of sales consists of costs relating directly to performance of services  including driver and messenger costs  third party delivery charges  insurance and workers compensation costs 
substantially all of the drivers used by the company provide their own vehicles  and approximately of these owner operators are independent contractors as opposed to employees of the company 
drivers and messengers are generally compensated based on a percentage of the delivery charge 
consequently  the company s driver and messenger costs are variable in nature 
to the extent that the drivers and messengers are employees of the company  employee benefit costs related to them  such as payroll taxes and insurance  are also included in cost of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a include salaries  wages and benefit costs incurred at the branch level related to taking orders and dispatching drivers and messengers  as well as administrative costs related to such functions 
also included in sg a expenses are regional and corporate level marketing and administrative costs and occupancy costs related to branch and corporate locations 
generally  the company s on demand services provide higher gross profit margins than do local and regional distribution or fleet management services because driver compensation for on demand services is generally lower as a percentage of sales from such services 
however  scheduled distribution and fleet management services generally have fewer administrative requirements related to order taking  dispatching drivers and billing 
as a result of these variances  the company s gross profit margin is dependent in part on the mix of business for a particular period 
during the year ended july   sales to office depot  inc represented approximately of the company s revenue 
management believes that sales to this customer may exceed of consolidated sales during the next fiscal year 
the company has no significant investment in transportation equipment 
depreciation and amortization expense primarily relates to depreciation of office  communication and computer equipment  and software and the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the company s various acquisitions  each of which has been accounted 
table of contents for using the purchase method of accounting 
effective august  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
which requires  among other things  that companies no longer amortize goodwill 
a significant portion of the company s sales is generated in canada 
for the fiscal years ended july   and  approximately   and  respectively  of the company s sales were generated in canada 
before deduction of corporate costs  the majority of which are incurred in the us  the cost structure of the company s operations in the us and in canada is similar 
the conversion rate of canadian dollars to us dollars increased during the fiscal year ending july  compared to july  and increased during the fiscal year ending july  compared to july  as the canadian dollar is the functional currency for the company s canadian operations  these changes in the exchange rate have affected the company s reported sales 
the effect of these changes on the company s net income loss for the fiscal years ended july   and has not been significant  although there can be no assurance that fluctuations in such currency exchange rate will not  in the future  have a material effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
critical accounting policies the company believes that the following are its most significant accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from such estimates 
the company reviews all significant estimates affecting the financial statements on a recurring basis and records the effect of any necessary adjustments prior to their issuance 
intangibles intangibles arise from acquisitions accounted for as purchased business combinations and include goodwill  covenants not to compete and other identifiable intangibles and from the payment of financing costs associated with the company s credit facility 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over all tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired 
effective august  the company adopted sfas no 
 which requires  among other things  that companies no longer amortize goodwill  but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that the company identify reporting units for the purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill 
the company s operations are conducted in two geographic regions  canada and the united states 
these two regions were identified as reporting units in accordance with paragraph of sfas no 
because discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of these regions 
in fiscal  management performed a valuation on each of these reporting units using a discounted cash flow model 
this model indicated a valuation that was far in excess of the company s market capitalization  however  management did not believe this could be used as the sole indicator of fair value 
accordingly  the company engaged an independent business valuation firm to perform a valuation of these reporting units 
the independent firm utilized a methodology combining the income approach and the market approach 
the income approach is based on the present value of future economic benefits that accrue to the shareholders 
the market approach establishes value through the analysis of the market price of the common stock of comparable  publicly traded companies 
the independent firm s conclusion of the value of dynamex was derived by applying a weight of to the value determined under the income approach and to the value determined under the market approach 
using this valuation as the purchase price in a purchase price allocation model  the implied value of the goodwill for the united states segment was approximately million  compared to a carrying value of approximately million 
as a result  the company recognized a goodwill impairment loss related to this segment of million 
although the performance of the united states operations has improved  the large amount of goodwill recorded during the competitive acquisition environment of the late s was not fully supported by the valuation model 
the implied value of the goodwill for the company s canadian operations was in excess of million compared to a carrying value of approximately million 
the company completed its goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of fiscal and recorded the million charge net of million of deferred tax benefits as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations 
in fiscal  and  the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter 
based on this test  the fair value of the goodwill exceeded 
table of contents the carrying amount in both periods 
other intangible assets are being amortized over periods ranging from to years 
self insured claims liability the company is primarily self insured for us workers compensation claims 
a liability for unpaid claims and the associated claim expenses  including incurred but unreported losses  are recorded based on the company s estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred 
the company s estimates are based on actual experience and historical assumptions of development of unpaid liabilities over time 
factors affecting the determination of amounts to be accrued for workers compensation claims include  but are not limited to  cost  frequency  or payment patterns resulting from new types of claims  the hazard level of our operations  tort reform or other legislative changes  unfavorable jury decisions  court interpretations  changes in the medical conditions of claimants and economic factors such as inflation 
the method of calculating the estimated accrued liability for workers compensation claims is subject to inherent uncertainty 
if actual results are less favorable than what are used to calculate the accrued liability  the company would have to record expenses in excess of what has already been accrued 
effective july  the company elected to become primarily self insured for vehicle liability claims 
the company will estimate its liability for claims in a manner similar to workers compensation claims 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make payments when due or within a reasonable period of time thereafter 
estimates are used in determining this allowance based on the company s historical collection experience  current trends  credit policy and a percentage of accounts receivable by aging category 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make required payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company reduced its allowance at july  to approximately from the july  allowance of approximately of outstanding accounts receivable as a result of improved collection efforts during fiscal compared to previous periods 
income taxes income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related primarily to differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting 
the net deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences  which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled 
as of july   the company had available a us federal net operating loss carryforward nol to offset future taxable income of million 
in addition  the company generated unused foreign tax credits related to its canadian operations and other tax credits of million 
the company establishes valuation allowances in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes sfas no 

during the year ended july   the company determined that it was more likely than not that the benefits of the nol totaling million at january  would be realized  based on first half results for the fiscal year and projected results over the next three years 
the company had previously provided a valuation allowance on the nol  and based on the determination that the company would be able to realize the nol  reversed the valuation allowance during the second quarter of the fiscal year  resulting in a credit to income tax expense of approximately million 
the company has utilized substantially all of the nol during the and fiscal years 
the company s current valuation allowance of approximately million relates to a foreign tax credit carryforward 
the company continually reviews the adequacy of the valuation allowances and releases the allowances when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the benefits will be realized 
stock based compensation statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas no 
encourages but does not require companies to record compensation cost for stock based employee compensation plans at fair value 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company had previously elected to continue to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations during the fiscal years ended on or before july  accordingly  compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the company s stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements effective august   the company elected to adopt the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
for stock based employee compensation 
under the statement of financial accounting standards no 

table of contents accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
 the modified prospective method of adoption was selected by the company  in which stock based employee compensation cost recognized in would be the same as that which would have been recognized had the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
been applied to all awards granted after august  as discussed below  option expense in and amounted to and  respectively  under the fair value approach  compared to no expense in under the intrinsic value method 
based on the outstanding and unvested awards as of july   the anticipated effect on net income for fiscal  net of taxes  will be approximately foreign currency translation assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated at average rates during the year 
the net exchange differences resulting from these translations are recorded in stockholders equity 
where amounts denominated in a foreign currency are converted into us dollars by remittance or repayment  the realized exchange differences are included as other income expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items from the company s consolidated statement of operations  expressed as a percentage of sales years ended july  sales cost of sales purchased transportation other cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative salaries and employee benefits other selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization gain loss on sale of property and equipment operating income interest expense other income income before income taxes income taxes income before accounting change year ended july  compared to year ended july  net income for the year ended july  fy was million diluted earnings per common share compared to million diluted earnings per common share for the year ended july  
table of contents fy 
net income for fy included a million income tax benefit from the recognition of available us net operating losses not previously recognized 
excluding income taxes from the comparison  income before taxes increased to million for fy compared to the prior year 
this improvement results from higher gross profit from increased sales and lower interest expense that was offset  in part  by higher selling  general administrative expense 
sales increased million to million in fy  an increase of compared to the prior year 
the average conversion rate between the canadian dollar and the us dollar increased over the prior year period  which had the effect of increasing sales for the year by approximately million had the conversion rate been the same as the prior year period 
excluding the effect of this increase  sales would have been approximately higher for fy compared to the prior year 
if the exchange rate had been the same in fy as it was in fy  on demand sales would have been approximately the same in both years while local and regional distribution and outsourcing services would have shown an increase of million  or 
fuel surcharges associated with rising fuel costs accounted for slightly less than of the increase in sales in fy compared to fy cost of sales for fy increased million to million and increased as a percentage of sales from to compared to fy approximately million of the increase was from actual cost increases while approximately million was from exchange rate increases from the prior year 
cost of sales increased as a percentage of sales over the last three quarters of fy due to the increase in purchased transportation  the result of the continuing change in business mix  our decision to modify a number of route networks for certain clients that was triggered by changes to their distribution models and more recently  by rapidly rising fuel costs 
while we have been proactive in assisting our clients with route optimization  the result is generally reduced revenues from those customers without a proportionate reduction in transportation costs  thereby adversely impacting our cost of sales percentage on those routes 
likewise  the rapid rise in fuel costs principally in the th quarter had a negative impact on our ability to recover those costs from our customers as quickly as the fuel prices were escalating 
as a result  our structure for fuel surcharge compensation to our drivers was not always occurring on a timely basis 
therefore  to resolve the issue on a short term basis  we increased the commissions paid to our drivers in order to maintain service quality 
we began to approach customers  where fuel price mechanisms included an extended period for determining the surcharge  to shorten the period and their response has been positive 
however  those changes were not completed until the middle of the first quarter of fy management expects cost of sales to range between and for fiscal year sg a expenses increased million  or for fy  to million compared to million in fy but decreased as a percentage of sales from in to in approximately million of the increase is due to the increase in the exchange rate between the canadian dollar and the us dollar 
other increases are primarily attributable to the cost of additional personnel required to operate and manage new business added during  the increase in personnel and associated costs related to the growth of the sales organization and the higher audit and outside professional fees associated with sarbanes oxley compliance 
the company also increased the number of operations personnel at the branch level by adding mid level managers and driver recruiters capacity managers to maintain service quality and support continued growth 
in the fourth quarter of fy  additional personnel were added to the information technology group who will roll out the dynamex proprietary customer order and dispatch system decs to all branches throughout canada and the u 
s over the next to months 
we do not expect to achieve significant savings from this roll out in fy depreciation and amortization for fy was million compared to million in fy management expects depreciation and amortization to be in the million range for all of fy due to limited capital requirements associated with its non asset based business 
interest expense was million  a decrease of million from fy s expense of million  a decrease of 
fy included a write off of related to deferred bank financing fees 
the company s long term bank debt was eliminated as of july  income tax expense for fy was  million compared to  for fy  an increase of  million 
the effective income tax rate was for fy versus for fy fy included a million tax benefit realized from the recognition of a us net operating loss carryforward of approximately million not recognized in prior years due to uncertainty of realization 
without the tax benefit  the fy effective rate would have been approximately

both years were impacted by the recognition of benefits from us net operating losses that reduced income tax expense with a much larger benefit recognized in fiscal year excluding income taxes from the comparison  fiscal year income before taxes increased compared to fiscal year to million 
this improvement results from higher gross profit associated with increased sales  lower interest expense due to reduction in outstanding debt and lower depreciation and amortization expense 
these improvements were offset  in part  by increased sg a expenses 
sales for the year ended july  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended july  scheduled  distribution and outsourcing services increased million compared to the prior year while on demand sales increased million 
the average conversion rate between the canadian dollar and the us dollar increased over the prior year period  which had the effect of increasing sales for the year by approximately million had the conversion rate been the same as the prior year period

if the exchange rate had been the same in as it was in  on demand sales would have decreased approximately million  or  in the current year and scheduled  distribution and outsourcing services would have shown an increase of million  or 
cost of sales for the year ended july  increased million  or  to million and increased as a percentage of sales from to compared to the year ended july  the primary reason for the increase in cost of sales percentage continues to be the change in business mix 
scheduled  distribution and outsourcing services generally require larger vehicles than on demand sales resulting in a higher cost of purchased transportation  however  on demand sales are transaction intensive requiring more people to receive orders  dispatch drivers  bill customers and collect and process payments received 
sales of scheduled  distribution and outsourcing services comprised approximately and of total sales for the years ended july  and  respectively 
on demand sales were approximately of total sales in the current year compared to in the prior year 
sg a expenses increased million  or for the year ended july   to million from million in the prior year 
approximately million of this increase is due to the increase in the exchange rate between the canadian dollar and the us dollar

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign exchange exposure significant portions of the company s operations are conducted in canada 
exchange rate fluctuations between the us and canadian dollar result in fluctuations in the amounts relating to the canadian operations reported in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company historically has not entered into hedging transactions with respect to its foreign currency exposure  but may do so in the future

there can be no assurances that the above projected exchange rate decrease will materialize 
fluctuations of exchange rates are beyond the control of the company s management
