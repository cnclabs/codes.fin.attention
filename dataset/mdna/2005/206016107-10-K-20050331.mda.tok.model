item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties such as limited operating and sales history  the uncertainty of market acceptance of our product  dependence on obtaining and maintaining reimbursement  effectiveness and safety of our product over the long term  our ability to obtain and maintain the necessary governmental clearances or approvals to market our product  our ability to develop and maintain proprietary aspects of our technology  our ability to manage our expansion  our limited history of manufacturing our product  our dependence on single source supplies  third party manufacturers and co marketers  intense competition in the medical device industry  the inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims and product recalls and other factors referenced in this form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we develop  manufacture and market essure  an innovative and proprietary non incisional permanent birth control device for women that was approved for marketing in the united states in november by the united states food and drug administration  or fda 
essure is a soft and flexible micro insert delivered into a woman s fallopian tubes designed to provide permanent birth control by causing a benign tissue in growth that blocks the fallopian tubes 
a successfully placed essure micro insert prohibits the egg from traveling through the fallopian tubes and therefore prevents fertilization 
the essure procedure the essure placement procedure is typically performed as an outpatient procedure and is intended to be a less invasive and a less costly alternative to tubal ligation  the leading form of birth control in the united states and worldwide 
laparoscopic tubal ligation and tubal ligation by laparotomy typically involve abdominal incisions and or punctures  general or regional anesthesia  four to ten days of normal recovery time and the risks associated with an incisional procedure 
the essure placement procedure does not require cutting or penetrating the abdomen  which lowers the likelihood of post operative pain due to the incisions punctures  and is typically performed in an outpatient setting without general or regional anesthesia 
in the pivotal trial of essure  the total procedure time averaged minutes  with an average of minutes of hysteroscopic time to place the essure micro insert 
a patient is typically discharged approximately minutes after the essure placement procedure 
no overnight hospital stay is required 
furthermore  essure is effective without drugs or hormones 
there is a three month waiting period after the procedure during which the woman must use another form of birth control while tissue in growth occurs 
at days following the procedure  the patient completes a follow up examination called a hysterosalpingogram hsg  which can determine whether the device was placed successfully and whether the fallopian tubes are occluded 
we believe that essure is also an attractive alternative to tubal ligation for physicians  hospitals and payors 
essure is a less invasive permanent birth control option for physicians to offer to their patients  hospitals are able to utilize their facilities more cost effectively with the essure placement procedure compared with tubal ligation  and payors are able to experience cost reductions resulting from the elimination of overhead and procedural costs related to anesthesia and post operative hospital stays associated with tubal ligations 
we also believe essure is a viable alternative to other temporary methods of birth control being used when there is no intention of having children in the future 
in addition  payors may also benefit from the reduction of unplanned pregnancies associated with non permanent methods of birth control used by patients who have chosen to avoid the drawbacks of traditional permanent birth control methods but who may elect to use essure 
published reports estimate that  tubal ligation procedures are performed each year in the united states and million procedures worldwide 
we intend to tap into this market and establish the essure procedure as the standard of care for permanent birth control 
essure is currently being marketed in multiple countries 
in november we received approval from the fda to market essure in the united states 
in  we were given approval to affix the ce mark to essure  indicating that essure is certified for sale throughout the european union  subject to compliance with local regulations such as registration with health ministries and or particular requirements regarding labeling or distribution 
in  essure was listed with australia s therapeutic goods administration  which allows us to market and sell essure in australia 
in canada  we received clearance from health canada to market essure in canada in november we have distributors in australia  canada  new zealand and france  which covers europe  middle east  africa  mexico  central america and south america 
effectiveness of essure based on clinical trial data filed with the fda in november  essure has been demonstrated to be effective at three years of follow up 
as of january  we have accumulated sufficient patient follow up data from the phase ii and pivotal clinical trials to file a pma supplement with the fda for a four and five year effectiveness claim consistent with the three year claim 
penetration doctors are required to be preceptored for between and cases by a certified trainer before they can perform procedures independently 
as of december   conceptus has trained or is in the process of training  physicians in the united states on the essure procedure 
this represents an increase of physicians over the number of physicians at december  the level of sales for essure  particularly in this early period of adoption  is highly dependent on the number of physicians trained to perform the procedure 
reimbursement of essure market acceptance of essure also depends in part upon the availability of reimbursement within prevailing healthcare payment systems 
we believe that physician advocacy of our product will be required to continue to obtain reimbursement 
as of december   we received positive reimbursement decisions for essure from private insurers covering a total of million covered lives  which represents of all the insured  non medicare population of the united states 
we intend to continue our effort to educate payors of the cost effectiveness of our product  and to establish further programs to help physicians to navigate reimbursement issues 
in early november  the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms released the final rule for the physician fee schedule 
for the essure cpt code  the cms has provided for a national physician payment of  for procedures performed in the office and for physician payment when the procedure is performed in the hospital 
this compares to a cpt code physician payment of for a laparascopic tubal ligation  the current standard of care for permanent female sterilization 
in addition  the cms released the final rule for the opps  which assigns hospital outpatient reimbursement amounts 
the essure cpt code was assigned a payment level of  which is consistent with payments by cms to hospitals when they perform a laparoscopic tubal ligation  normally performed in a higher cost hospital operating room 
we believe these values are very favorable for the essure procedure and will help in establishing increased utilization of the device amongst doctors 
we expect that the new code  once the process to establish it at all private payors that have given a favorable coverage decision is complete  will significantly ease the burden on a physician s office in obtaining reimbursement for essure  and accelerate the coverage of essure by private insurance companies and medicaid 
this process is not automatic following receipt of the new cpt code  however  and we anticipate continuing to focus on reimbursement issues for sometime in the future both to secure our code and payment schedule into the payors databases  as well as to help the physician negotiate a favorable contract for payment off that schedule 
in mid august  the australian department of health  medical services advisory committee msac division recommended against public funding for the essure procedure  citing insufficient evidence for safety  effectiveness and cost effectiveness 
the overall market for female sterilization in australia at less than  cases per year is very small 
however  the public insured population in australia is much larger than the private and self insured population that currently does pay for the procedure 
consequently we believe that our market penetration in australia will remain limited by the msac decision until such time as we are able to submit sufficient long term data to obtain public funding 
we are in the process of determining exactly what long term clinical data msac will accept 
they have indicated that they are looking for years of efficacy  which we will not be able to provide for at least one more year 
as a result  in december we made the decision to terminate our direct subsidiary operations in australia and convert to an independent distributor 
this decision was largely a cost reduction measure in lieu of the small size of the australian market and our inability to manage a direct operation to a cash flow positive position 
a distribution agreement has been entered into and the transition has been completed in january utilization of essure essure is a novel product in the contraception market  which is dominated by procedures that are well established among physicians and patients and are routinely taught to new physicians 
as a result  we believe that recommendations and endorsements by physicians will be essential for market acceptance of our product 
physicians are traditionally slow to adopt new products and treatment practices  partly because of perceived liability risks 
our biggest challenge is to speed up the adoption process to make the essure procedure the standard of care for permanent birth control 
the following discussion summarizes our program in the united states to increase adoption of the essure procedure 
overall utilization  which is the average number of procedures performed per physician per month  declined minimally from an average of procedures per month at the beginning of to procedures per month at the end of the year 
this was caused primarily by decreases in the utilization rates of physicians in preceptorship which is believed to be caused by physicians not being adequately reimbursed for their services by third party payors and subsequently slowing down their usage 
certified physician utilization increased during the year from procedures per month at the beginning of the year to procedure per month at the end of the year 
the increase in our utilization rate by certified physicians over the year is directly attributable to our tactical reimbursement efforts aimed at educating the physician and office staff regarding payor procedures following a declined claim  including appeals and petitioning procedures 
typically a newly covered product will go through a period where claims are either inadvertently declined or are paid at the incorrect amount 
in either instance  the physician is reluctant to perform additional procedures until payment has been secured for earlier cases  causing the decline in utilization for essure 
our tactical reimbursement focus is intended to give the physician and his her staff the tools to ensure that claims will ultimately be paid and thereby encourages the physician to continue performing the essure procedure despite reimbursement issues 
this tactical reimbursement group is generally targeting specific accounts with the aim of eventually meeting with all of our accounts so as to provide them with the knowledge of how to file and follow up on claims on a payor by payor basis 
on july   we announced that the fda had approved labeling changes allowing concomitant use of essure with johnson johnson s gynecare thermachoice uterine balloon therapy system 
in october  we signed a co promotion agreement with the gynecare division that will permit the gynecare sales force to market essure 
we intend for this agreement with gynecare to provide us with the ability to increase awareness  gain market presence and credibility  accelerate our ability to train doctors  as well as expand our market opportunity by driving adoption among a group of physicians not previously targeted by our marketing programs 
the success of the joint marketing campaign will depend upon the effectiveness of our gynecare sales force training programs  market demand for essure in conjunction with the thermachoice treatment and the efforts and commitment of gynecare to this new program 
we cannot be certain how successful this program will be  if at all 
as a condition of fda approval  conceptus and gynecare agreed to provide the fda with investigational data from a prospective study of women to assess whether the thermachoice ea procedure causes intrauterine scarring and or adhesions that could prevent or interfere with an effective hsg at three months post essure placement 
in addition  the study will assess tubal occlusion three months after concomitant essure thermachoice procedures 
a final report should be submitted to the fda within three months of completion of the study 
information provided in this report will be used to assess the effectiveness of concomitant essure thermachoice procedures 
in addition  we are expanding our sales territories and channels of distribution that will also impact penetration and utilization 
with the addition of two national account managers and three sales territories  we will have increased our sales coverage by  from  as of december   to direct sales representatives as of december  from time to time  we may engage regional distributors of women s gynecology products to market and sell our products 
in late july we announced that we initiated an extensive direct to consumer advertising campaign in the chicago  illinois metropolitan area which commenced in august and was extended for months and involve radio  direct mail and print media magazine advertisements aimed at increasing consumer awareness 
depending on the success of this marketing effort  we will be evaluating additional major metropolitan markets in which to conduct a similar advertising campaign in this program was directly responsible for the increase in selling  general and administration expense during the last half of applying this program to additional markets will therefore result in further increases in our expenses 
we have experienced significant operating losses since inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect our operating losses to continue at least through the calendar year as we continue to expend substantial resources in the selling and marketing of essure in the united states 
due to the unpredictable nature of these activities  we do not know whether we will achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
we will continue to be in a net loss position until sufficient revenues can be generated to offset expenses 
in february  we completed a private placement of common stock to generate enough cash to help fund our operations 
in the future  depending upon a variety of factors  we will likely need to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings or other sources of capital 
critical accounting estimates and policies the consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all wholly owned subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the primary estimates underlying the company s financial statements include reserves for obsolete and slow moving inventory  allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  product warranty  impairment reserves for long lived assets  income taxes and contingent liabilities 
application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories are provided based on historical experience and current product demand 
we have not experienced any significant write off of potentially excess and obsolete inventories in the past 
however  this could change as we increase inventory purchases to satisfy product demand 
if sales expectations and inventory purchases become mismatched and are not adjusted timely  we may experience material write offs in the future 
in addition  we evaluate our inventory on a quarterly basis to ensure that our inventory valuation does not exceed net realizable value 
although unlikely  if we experience a significant drop in our average selling price that is below our actual cost of goods  we may incur significant write downs of inventory 
revenue recognition 
revenue on product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and final  delivery has occurred and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
we obtain written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price and consider delivery to have occurred at the time of shipment 
we have several international distributors in europe  australia  canada and new zealand 
our revenue recognition policy for distributors is consistent with our policy for direct customers 
we entered into written distribution contracts with our distributors with fixed terms and price and consider delivery to have occurred at the time of shipment 
we do not currently accept product returns from customers or distributors 
we may in the future decide to accept returns from customers or distributors  which will significantly change our revenue recognition policy and materially impact our financial statements 
we may be required to defer all of our revenues until sufficient historical data is established to support an adequate return reserve 
we may receive non recurring payments from contractual arrangements which are deferred and recognized as revenue when earned based on an appropriate basis and time frame such as when services are performed or the term of the contract 
accounts receivable 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
our exposure to credit losses may change as we increase our receivables 
changes in customer type and mix  as well as domestic and international economic climate  will also impact potential credit losses 
we may decide to change our bad debt reserve methodology in the future to better estimate credit losses 
while our credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowance established  we might not continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
warranty accrual 
we offer warranties on our product and record a liability for the estimated future costs associated with warranty claims  which is based upon historical experiences and our estimate of the level of future costs 
warranty costs are reflected in the statement of operations as a cost of goods sold 
warranty expense will increase as and if we increase our net sales 
warranty reserve rates may change when we change manufacturing process or change our third party manufacturing contractor 
although our warranty expenses have historically been within our expectations and the accrual established  we may not continue to experience the same warranty expense rate that we have in the past 
impairment of long lived assets 
we account for the impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  consisting primarily of our property and equipment and the essure license acquired from a patent litigation settlement in see note to financial statements  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include a prolonged industry downturn  a significant decline in our market value or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including profit margins  long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rates and terminal growth rates 
in addition  significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of the fair value of our tangible long lived assets  including replacement cost  economic obsolescence  and the value that could be realized in orderly liquidation 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long lived assets  thereby requiring us to write down the assets 
our net long lived assets as of december  and december  included property and equipment of million and million  respectively  and other identifiable intangible assets of million and million  respectively 
functional currency 
we have a wholly owned foreign subsidiary in australia 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiary from the currency in which they keep their accounting records to us dollars 
our subsidiary maintains accounting records in its local currency and the functional currency is determined to be the us dollar 
the functional currency is determined based on management s judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions  including billing  financing  payroll  and other expenditures would be considered the functional currency but any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations must also be considered 
since the us dollar is deemed to be the functional currency for our subsidiary  any gain or loss associated with the translation of the subsidiary s financial statements is included in the consolidated statement of operations 
if in the future  we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of our subsidiary from us dollars to its local currency  any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within accumulated other comprehensive income 
the determination of functional currency is subject to judgment by the management 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences that may result in deferred tax assets 
management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
any such valuation allowance would be based on our management estimates of taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets would be recoverable 
contingent liabilities we account for contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as legal and income tax matters requires us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate  if the actual loss from a loss contingency is significantly different than the estimated loss  our results of operations may be over or understated 
results of operations years ended december  and net sales net sales were million in  of which were from united states  were from france  were from australia and were from asia and canada 
net sales were million in  of which were from united states  were from europe  were from australia and were from asia and canada 
the following table summarizes the above information related to net sales by geographic region in tabular format year ended december  december  net sales in thousands   united states europe australia others net sales are attributed to region based on the shipping location of the external customers 
the increase in net sales of million or is the result of continued commercialization of essure in the united states 
our worldwide average selling price decreased from in to in as a direct result of terminating the company s direct operations in europe and subsequently selling through a distributor  which has a lower selling price 
in early  we targeted groups of gynecological practices with the goal of training  inclusive of preceptorship  approximately physicians by the end of and ended the year having trained physicians 
as of december   we have a total of  doctors that have either completed or are in the process of completing preceptorship 
our accomplishment in obtaining the number of physicians trained is very important because it not only provides us with a strong referral base within major metropolitan areas we have targeted  but it will also create the leverage to help us gain additional reimbursement coverage 
we understand that a strong base of trained physicians does not necessarily correlate to an increase in revenue proportionately 
another important factor is the average procedure performed per physician per month  or utilization 
during and  our utilization rates declined from a high of over three procedures per month per physician at the beginning of this period to a utilization of procedure per month per physician at the end of the period 
we believe this decline is primarily related to the reimbursement environment for gaining coverage of a new medical technology such as essure which creates a level of frustration among physicians and facilities when either not all patients are covered by a third party payor or when claims submissions are delayed or denied inadvertently by payors 
this frustration can cause physicians  who otherwise are positive about the technology  to temporarily stop performing the procedure until the reimbursement environment is more assured 
we have been working diligently with third party payors to make sure they understand the benefits of essure 
to date  united states physicians and facilities using essure have been reimbursed for the procedure under existing current procedural terminology  or cpt codes 
in march  the american medical association accepted our application for a level one cpt code effective january category i codes are reserved for those procedures that have demonstrated clinical efficacy  widespread use and have food and drug administration fda approval 
by having a cpt code specific to the essure procedure  it is expected that coding for reimbursement will become considerably easier for doctors and facilities and that there will be fewer incidents of doctors being reimbursed incorrectly 
in early november  the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms released the final rule for the physician fee schedule 
for the essure cpt code  the cms has provided for a national physician payment of  for procedures performed in the office and for physician payment when the procedure is performed in the hospital 
this compares to a cpt code physician payment of for a laparascopic tubal ligation  the current standard of care for permanent female sterilization 
in addition  the cms released the final rule for the opps  which assigns hospital outpatient reimbursement amounts 
the essure cpt code was assigned a payment level of  which is consistent with payments by cms to hospitals when they perform a laparoscopic tubal ligation  normally performed in a higher cost hospital operating room 
we believe these values are very favorable for the essure procedure and will help in establishing increased utilization of the device amongst doctors 
we expect that the new code  once the process to establish it is complete  will significantly ease the burden on a physician s office in obtaining reimbursement for essure  and accelerate the coverage of essure by private insurance companies and medicaid 
in january  we announced our expected net sales for to be approximately million to million  which represents more than growth from this increase in revenues includes the effect of the price increase we announced in january for customers in the united states 
we expect net sales from the united states will continue to be the major contributor of our global net sales 
we have established three primary goals to achieve our revenue growth 
we expect to complete the implementation of the new cpt code  increase sales coverage and physician utilization of the essure procedure and work with our strategic partners 
we believe our revenue growth in will be significantly influenced by how successful we are in achieving those objectives 
gross profit cost of goods sold increased by million to million in as compared to million in gross profit increased million to million from million in our gross profit percent was and for the year and  respectively 
our gross profit percent was in the fourth quarter of as compared to in the fourth quarter of and it has increased from in the first quarter of to in the fourth quarter of the improvement in gross profit percentage was primarily due to an increase in production volume 
during  we transitioned our manufacturing activities to a third party manufacturer in mexico 
this outsourcing effort decreased our production costs and increased gross profit 
in april  we received fda approval for the process at the third party manufacturer 
although we expect lower production costs and the price increase in the united states to improve our gross profit in  our anticipated gross profits will fluctuate in correlation to revenue growth as production costs remain sensitive to production volume 
operating expenses research and development expenses  which include clinical  regulatory and product development  decreased by million to million in as compared with million in the decrease is primarily due to completion of activities pertaining to the pma application process and completion of certain research and development projects 
a decrease in headcount resulted in a reduction of million of payroll related expense 
other factors that contributed to the decrease were a million decrease in travel expenses  a decrease of million in clinical expenses related to the completion of the pma application process and a million decrease in consulting expenses 
research and development costs in are expected to be slightly higher than levels as we complete our pivotal and phase ii clinical trials and continue to invest in product development of new or alternative product designs 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million to million in as compared to million in the decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in international sales expense as a result of the sale of the subsidiary in france in early  a million decrease in legal fees as a result of the settlement of the ovion case in october  a million decrease in payroll related expenses for marketing and us physician training  a million decrease in expenses as a result of severance for former officers and recruitment of a new ceo in  a million decrease in expense for demonstration units due to the shift toward reusable demonstration units and a shift from large group to a smaller individual training program  a million decrease in advertising and a million decrease in travel expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in consulting and audit expenses for sarbanes oxley compliance 
in  we expect to have limited international expenditures since we completed the divestiture of our french subsidiary in january and the closure of our direct operations in australia in january we recorded expenses of approximately  in december related to the close down of our australia operations  which included  of severance costs and  for impairment of fixed assets 
all severance costs were completely paid out at end of january and we expect the disposal of fixed assets to be completed by march selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in as compared to due to additional spending on the direct to consumer campaign  sales force expansion and increased costs related to sarbanes oxley compliance 
other income and expenses interest and other income of million decreased by million in as compared to million in the decrease is due to lower average cash and cash equivalent balances 
we invest our excess cash in high quality  short term commercial paper  government securities and money market funds 
interest and other expense for and and the change in expense from the prior year was insignificant 
income taxes as a result of our net loss of million  we incurred no income tax expense in as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
in addition  at december   we had federal and state research credit carry forwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the net operating loss and credit carry forwards described above will expire at various dates beginning in the years through  if not utilized 
use of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation by the internal revenue service 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before we can use them to reduce future earnings  if any 
because of the company s lack of earnings history and anticipated future net loss  the deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
restricted stock the company granted  shares of restricted stock to its employees and directors during  of which  shares have been repurchased by the company in accordance with the provisions of the grant 
estimated future restricted stock expense  assuming no change in repurchased shares or attainment of performance goals  is expected to be million  million  million for the years  and  respectively 
of the total restricted stock expense of million  million is related to research and development and million is related to selling  general and administrative expenses 
there was no restricted stock expense in fiscal years ended december  and net sales net sales were million in  of which were from united states  were from europe  were from australia and were from asia and canada 
net sales were million in  of which were from europe  were from australia  were from asia and canada and were from united states 
the following table summarizes the above information related to net sales by geographic region in tabular format year ended december  december  net sales in thousands   united states europe australia others the increase in net sales of million or  is the result of commercialization of essure in the united states 
shortly after fda approval of essure in the united states in november  we began an aggressive launch of essure in the united states and as a result  dramatically increased net sales generated within the united states 
in addition to increased number of units sold  the increase in average selling price also contributed to the increase in net sales 
our worldwide average selling price increased from an average of in to an average of in because of the higher selling price in the united states  which was approximately per unit throughout as of december   we had a total of doctors that had either completed or were in the process of completing preceptorship 
during  our utilization rates declined from a high of over three procedures per month per physician in the first quarter to a utilization of slightly less than one procedure per month per physician in the fourth quarter of we believe this decline was primarily related to the reimbursement environment for gaining coverage of a new medical technology such as essure which creates a level of frustration among physicians and facilities when either not all patients are covered by a third party payor or when claims submissions are delayed or denied inadvertently by payors 
this frustration can cause physicians  who otherwise are positive about the technology  to temporarily stop performing the procedure until the reimbursement environment is more assured 
we worked diligently with third party payors to make sure they understood the benefits of essure 
gross profit cost of goods sold increased by million to million in as compared to million in our gross profit was negative in the fourth quarter of as compared to in the fourth quarter of and it increased from in the first quarter of to in the fourth quarter of the increase was primarily due to increase in production volume and increase in our average selling price 
we were also in the process of transitioning almost all of our manufacturing activities to a third party manufacturer in mexico in late operating expenses research and development expenses  which include clinical  regulatory and product development  decreased by million to million in as compared with million in the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in payroll related expenses resulting from the transfer of research and development personnel to assist with improving our manufacturing process  a million decrease as a result of the transfer of quality assurance to cost of sales  since the activities of this group were manufacturing related  a million reduction in travel expenses and bonuses  a million decrease in expensed materials and a decrease of million in consulting expense as a result of the completion of certain research and development projects such as the coil catheter study 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in as compared to million in the million expenditure increase was due to united states commercialization 
the increases primarily were attributable to a million increase in domestic selling  marketing and us physician training and strategic reimbursement expenditures  a million increase in payroll related expenses for us sales  a million increase in legal fees mainly attributable to the settlement of the ovion lawsuit  a million increase in expenses related to the hiring and relocation of our chief executive officer  a million increase in general and administrative infrastructure expenses to support the overall growth in the areas of sales  physician training and reimbursement and a million increase in advertising and public relation expenses 
internationally  expenditures decreased by million as we focused our resources on the development of essure in the united states 
other income and expenses interest and other income of million decreased by million in as compared to million in the decrease is due to lower average cash balances and average interest rates paid on our invested funds 
we invest our excess cash in high quality  short term commercial paper  government securities and money market funds 
interest and other expenses decreased by million due to a one time settlement charge recorded in in connection with a distribution agreement related to our discontinued product 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payments revised 
the provisions of sfas r would require us to measure all stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in the consolidated financial statements  including grants of employee stock options 
in addition  the adoption of sfas r will require additional accounting related to the income tax effects and additional disclosure regarding the cash flow effects resulting from share based payment arrangements 
sfas r is effective for all public companies for interim and annual periods beginning after june  we will adopt sfas r effective july  although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of fas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas  we are evaluating the requirements for fas r and expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our statement of operations and net loss per share 
liquidity and capital resources we have experienced significant operating losses since inception and as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have financed our operations since inception primarily through equity financings 
in february  we completed a private placement of approximately million shares of common stock at per share 
our net proceeds from the private placement were approximately million  after deducting offering costs and commissions 
the proceeds are being used to fund operations to help us reach profitability 
once we reach profitability  we expect to finance our operation through cash received from sales of our product 
we raised million in to help fund our operations 
in the future  depending upon a variety of factors  we will likely need to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings or other sources of capital 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments of million compared with million of cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments at december  the increase in these balances as of december  was due to the million of cash received from the private placement and million received from the exercise of stock options  offset by million of cash used in operating activities and million of capital expenditures 
we expect cash used by operating activities to decrease in as we increase net sales and continue to control operating expenses 
operating activities net cash used in operating activities was million in  million in and million in the net cash used in operating activities in was primarily related to our net loss of million adjusted for non cash related items of million relating primarily to depreciation and amortization  stock compensation expenses and changes in inventory reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts in addition to a million decrease in inventory  a million decrease in other assets  an increase of million in accrued liabilities and an increase in deferred revenue of million 
the increase in accounts receivable of million and other current assets of million and decrease of million in accrued compensation and million of clinical trial liabilities also contributed to cash used by operating activities 
the decrease in accrued compensation was primarily due to severance packages recorded in and paid out in net cash used in operating activities in and were primarily our net loss adjusted for non cash related items such as depreciation  amortization  stock option expenses and bad debt allowance 
increase in inventories and accounts receivables  offset by increases in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities also contributed to cash used in operating activities for and the increases in net loss  inventories  accounts receivable  accounts payable and other accrued liabilities in and were related to our expansion in all areas as we transitioned from an early stage  pilot manufacturing company to commercialization 
the increases in accounts receivable of million in and million in were due to increases in year to year net sales 
we monitor our accounts receivable turnover closely to ensure that receivables are collected timely and have established a credit and collection policy to facilitate our collection process and reduce our credit loss exposure 
our worldwide days sales outstanding improved to days in from days in the improvement is primarily because a greater percentage of our accounts receivable are domestic customers  and previously  most of our customers were international  domestic receivable have shorter standard payment terms than international customers 
we are still at the early stage of marketing our product and accounts receivables has not been our major source of capital 
we expect to grow our business and increase our revenues  and to primarily rely on accounts receivables as the capital resources to fund our operations 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in short term investments of million purchased in plus capital expenditures of million were offset by sales and maturities of million of short term investments 
net cash provided by investing activities in was million 
the increase in net cash provided by investing activities in consisted primarily of the maturation of short term investments of million offset by the purchase of short term investments of million and million of capital expenditures 
net cash used in investing activities in was million 
this consisted of purchases of short term investments of million plus capital expenditures of million  offset by sales and maturities of short term investments of million 
our capital expenditures in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
in and  capital expenditures were primarily related to website development as part of our marketing campaign to increase consumer awareness  and software management tool development to help us to gather meaningful data for management analysis and to gain a better understanding of our customers and our market 
in  the primary objective of those capital expenditures were to expand and improve our manufacturing facility to transition from pilot manufacturing to commercial manufacturing 
in  we expect our capital investment to continue in the area of website development and management tool development for better tracking and gathering of data so that management can have meaningful data for analysis and decision making 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared with million in net cash provided by financing activities was million in in  the net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of a private placement of common stock  from which we received net proceeds of million 
an additional million consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
the net cash provided by financing activities in consisted of net proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
the net cash provided by financing activities in consisted primarily of the net proceeds from the follow on public offering completed in june and july  in which we sold million shares of common stock at per share 
cash requirements  contractual obligations and commitments we have operating lease obligations on our current building facilities and equipment 
estimated net lease payments due within a year and years total million and million  respectively 
we also have long term obligations related to our phase ii clinical study and pivotal trial 
additionally  we have a  standby letter of credit commitment in connection with an equipment lease that expires in the letter of credit is renewable every year 
the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations and the periods in which payments are due as of december  payments due by period total less than year years operating lease obligations    clinical trial obligations    total    on october   we entered into a settlement agreement with ovion pursuant to which we received a sole  worldwide license to ovion s patent rights relative to the essure system for ten years  and ovion may not grant any additional such licenses to other parties 
in exchange for such license  we were required to pay a license fee of million payable in our common stock in equal installments in the first and second quarters of in january  we paid million in common stock to ovion  and we made another payment of million in common stock to ovion in april in addition  the settlement agreement provided for a cash payment of million in the fourth quarter of as a prepaid royalty 
we are obligated to pay of the accumulative revenue derived from sale of the essure products in excess of million as royalty for a period of ten years starting from the date of settlement 
in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement  our prepaid royalties will be fully amortized when cumulative net sales of essure reach million  thereby resulting in an effective royalty rate of 
we are amortizing the prepaid royalties to cost of goods sold over our net sales using this effective rate 
prepaid royalties as of december  was the unamortized balance of million 
we expect to have negative cash flows from operations into at least and we estimate that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements through at least the next twelve months 
if our revenue growth in meets our current expectation of million to million and we achieve our forecasted expenses  we expect to exit with approximately million of cash on hand 
we raised million in to help fund our operations 
in the future  depending upon a variety of factors  we will likely need to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings or other sources of capital 
the successful achievement of our business objectives may require additional financing and therefore  we may in the future seek to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings or other sources of capital 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
additional funding may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs or reduce our sales and marketing activities 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including  among others resources devoted to establish sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  including dtc programs  the rate of adoption by doctors and patients of the essure procedure  and the insurance payor community s acceptance of and reimbursement for the essure procedure 
off balance sheet arrangements 
as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we were not involved in spe transactions 
trends  risks and uncertainties in addition to the other information in this form k  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating conceptus and our business 
this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth below and elsewhere in this form k 
we have a limited history of operation with essure and have incurred significant operating losses since inception 
we expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future and we may never achieve or maintain profitability 
we have a limited history of operation with essure and have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in  including operating losses of million for fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses and net losses as we continue sales and marketing efforts in the united states 
our net losses will continue until sufficient revenues can be generated to offset these expenses 
we may not be able to generate these revenues  and we may never achieve profitability 
our failure to achieve and sustain profitability would negatively impact the market price of our common stock 
we are presently a one product company and if our product fails to gain market acceptance  our business will suffer 
we are attempting to introduce a novel product into the contraception market  which is dominated by procedures that are well established among physicians and patients and are routinely taught to new physicians 
as a result  we believe that recommendations and endorsements by physicians will be essential for market acceptance of our product 
we do not know whether physicians and patients will accept our product or whether we will be able to obtain their recommendations or endorsements in sufficient amounts to be profitable 
we believe that physicians will not use a product unless they determine  based on clinical data and other factors  that it is an attractive alternative to other means of contraception and that it offers clinical utility in a cost effective manner 
physicians are traditionally slow to adopt new products and treatment practices  partly because of perceived liability risks 
we are dependent on essure  which is currently our only commercial product 
if essure does not achieve significant market acceptance among physicians  patients and healthcare payors  even if reimbursement levels are sufficient and necessary united states and international regulatory approvals are maintained  we may never achieve significant revenues or profitability 
our future liquidity and capital requirements are uncertain 
as we commercialize essure on a wide scale basis  we may require additional financing and therefore may in the future seek to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings or other sources of capital 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
additional funding may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our selling and marketing activities 
we expect to have negative cash flows from operations into at least calendar our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including  among others the rate of product adoption by doctors and patients  obtaining government and third party reimbursement for essure  the resources devoted to increasing manufacturing capacity to meet commercial demands  our ability to reduce our cost of sales  the resources devoted to developing and conducting sales and marketing and distribution programs  and the progress and cost of product development programs 
if the effectiveness and safety of our product are not supported by long term data  we may not achieve market acceptance and we could be subject to liability 
the pivotal trial of essure was designed to support a pma application and to have five years of post market follow up 
in addition  patients in the phase ii study will be followed to five years 
the long term results of using essure will not be available for several years 
if long term studies or clinical experience indicate that essure is less effective or less safe than our current data suggest  we may not achieve or sustain market acceptance and or we could be subject to significant liability 
our co promotion agreement with gynecare may not be successful 
on october   we announced the signing of an exclusive us co promotion agreement with gynecare for marketing essure in the united states in combination with the gynecare thermachoice uterine balloon therapy endometrial ablation system 
with the fda s approval of marketing and labeling claims regarding compatibility of the essure procedure and the thermachoice device in july  marketing has commenced 
however  the success of the joint marketing campaign will depend upon the effectiveness of our gynecare sales team training programs  market demand for essure in conjunction with the thermachoice treatment  the efforts and commitment of gynecare to this new program and the results of the required patient post approval clinical study 
this agreement includes certain performance clauses that if not met  could lead to the termination of the agreement by conceptus in july we have limited sales and marketing experience and minimal distribution capabilities  and if we are unable to develop our sales and marketing capabilities or be successful in our co marketing agreement with gynecare  we may be unsuccessful in commercializing essure 
in order to market  sell and distribute essure  we will need to maintain and continue to develop a sales force and marketing group with relevant experience and to develop the relationship with gynecare for co marketing the essure device to the endometrial ablation market 
developing a marketing and sales force is expensive and time consuming and can impact the effectiveness of our product launch 
if we fail to establish adequate marketing and sales capabilities  we may be unable to commercialize essure successfully 
furthermore  certain factors in our relationship with gynecare are outside of our control  such as the number of sales persons  their compensation and the number of products they are selling  which could adversely impact the revenues and market development we expect from this co marketing agreement 
this agreement includes certain performance clauses that if not met  could lead to the termination of the agreement by conceptus in july our direct to consumer advertising campaign may not be successful 
in august  we launched a six month advertising campaign in the chicago  illinois metropolitan area involving radio  direct mail  and print media magazine 
such advertising programs aimed at increasing consumer awareness for our product are expensive and may have limited success  if any 
such campaigns require consumers to make contact with an essure physician  often involving a referral from their primary care physician and then to be provided information regarding birth control options by the physician  be pre authorized for insurance reimbursement and then be scheduled for the procedure 
many of these steps are not within our control  and the program may not result in revenue generation commensurate with its costs 
we depend on our contract manufacturer to supply our commercial product requirements and we may experience disruption in supply if they are not in compliance with fda and other health authority regulations 
in april  we received fda approval to begin manufacturing the essure product at accellent  our third party subcontractor located in mexico 
we transitioned almost all of our internal manufacturing operations to accellent by the end of to manufacture the components and assemble our product 
if accellent does not comply with fda and other health authority regulations or encounters manufacturing difficulties  this could negatively impact sales of essure 
government or third party reimbursement for essure may not be available or may be inadequate  which would limit our future product revenues and delay or prevent our profitability 
market acceptance of essure in the united states and in international markets will depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement within prevailing healthcare payment systems 
reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and sometimes by region  and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country by country basis 
many international markets have government managed health care systems that determine reimbursement for new devices and procedures 
in most markets  there are private insurance systems as well as government managed systems 
regardless of the type of reimbursement system  we believe that physician advocacy of our product will be required to obtain reimbursement 
availability and extent of continued reimbursement will depend  at least in part  on the clinical and cost effectiveness of our product 
we do not know whether reimbursement for our product will continue to be available in the united states or in international markets under either government or private reimbursement systems  or whether physicians will support and advocate reimbursement for use of our product for all indications intended by us 
we may be unable to obtain or maintain reimbursement in any country within a particular time frame  for a particular amount  or at all  which would limit our future product revenues and delay or prevent our profitability 
we may not maintain regulatory approvals for essure  our only product  which would delay or prevent us from generating product revenues  and would harm our business and force us to curtail or cease operations 
numerous government authorities  both in the united states and internationally  regulate the manufacture and sale of medical devices  including essure 
in the united states  the principal regulatory authorities are the fda and corresponding state agencies  such as the california department of health services 
the process of obtaining and maintaining required regulatory clearances is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
we have received fda approval to market essure in the united states 
if we lose that approval or fail to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements  it would delay or prevent us from generating further product revenues 
sales of medical devices outside of the united states are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 
the time required to obtain clearance required by foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for fda clearance  and requirements for licensing may differ significantly from fda requirements 
many countries in which we currently market or intend to market essure either do not currently regulate medical devices or have minimal registration requirements  however  these countries may develop more extensive regulations in the future  which could delay or prevent us from marketing essure in these countries 
the fda and certain foreign regulatory authorities impose numerous requirements with which medical device manufacturers must comply in order to maintain regulatory approvals 
fda enforcement policy strictly prohibits the promotion of approved medical devices for uses other than those for which the device is specifically approved by the fda 
we will be required to adhere to applicable fda regulations  such as the quality system regulation  and similar regulations in other countries  which include testing  control and documentation requirements 
ongoing compliance with the quality system regulation and other applicable regulatory requirements will be monitored through periodic inspections by federal and state agencies  including the fda and the california department of health services  and by comparable agencies in other countries 
if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  we may be subject to  among other things  warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to grant pre market clearance or pre market approval for devices  withdrawal of approvals and criminal prosecution  any of which could negatively impact our business 
our intellectual property rights may not provide meaningful commercial protection for our product  which could enable third parties to use our technology  or very similar technology  and could impair our ability to compete in the market 
we rely on patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws to limit the ability of others to compete with us using the same or similar technology in the united states and other countries 
however  as described below  these laws afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights to the extent necessary to sustain any competitive advantage we may have 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting their proprietary rights abroad 
these problems can be caused by the absence of rules and methods for defending intellectual property rights 
we will be able to protect our technology from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
the patent positions of companies developing medical devices  including our patent position  generally are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions concerning the enforceability of such patents against alleged infringement 
recent judicial decisions have established new case law and a reinterpretation of previous patent case law  and consequently we cannot assure you that historical legal standards surrounding the questions of infringement and validity will be applied in future cases 
in addition  legislation may be pending in congress that  if enacted in its present form  may limit the ability of medical device manufacturers in the future to obtain patents on surgical and medical procedures that are not performed by  or as a part of  devices or compositions that are themselves patentable 
our ability to protect our proprietary methods and procedures may be compromised by the enactment of this legislation or any other limitation or reduction in the patentability of medical and surgical methods and procedures 
changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the united states and other countries may therefore diminish the value of our intellectual property 
we own  or control through licenses  a variety of issued patents and pending patent applications 
however  the patents on which we rely may be challenged and invalidated  and our patent applications may not result in issued patents 
moreover  our patents and patent applications may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products 
we also face the risk that others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies 
we have taken security measures to protect our proprietary information  especially proprietary information that is not covered by patents or patent applications 
these measures  however  may not provide adequate protection of our trade secrets or other proprietary information 
we seek to protect our proprietary information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees  collaborators and consultants 
nevertheless  employees  collaborators or consultants could still disclose our proprietary information and we may not be able to protect our trade secrets in a meaningful way 
if we lose any employees we may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by those former employees despite the existence of a nondisclosure and confidentiality agreement and other contractual restrictions designed intended to protect our proprietary technology 
in addition  others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets 
our ability to compete effectively will depend substantially on our ability to develop and maintain proprietary aspects of our technology 
our issued patents  any future patents that may be issued as a result of our united states or foreign patent applications  or the patents under which we have license rights may not offer any degree of protection against competitive products 
any patents that may be issued or licensed to us or any of our patent applications could be challenged  invalidated or circumvented in the future 
if we cannot operate our business without infringing third party intellectual property rights  our prospects will suffer 
our success will depend in part on our ability to operate without infringing or misappropriating the proprietary rights of others 
we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our product infringes the intellectual property rights of others 
there are numerous issued patents in the medical device industry and  as described in the next risk factor  the validity and breadth of medical device patents involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved 
our competitors may assert that our product and the methods we employ may be covered by united states or foreign patents held by them 
in addition  because patent applications can take many years to issue  there may be currently pending patent applications of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents that our product may infringe 
there could also be existing patents of which we are unaware that our product may inadvertently infringe 
if we lose a patent infringement lawsuit  we could be prevented from selling our product unless we can obtain a license to use technology or ideas covered by that patent or are able to redesign the product to avoid infringement 
a license may not be available to us on terms acceptable to us  or at all  and we may not be able to redesign our product to avoid any infringement 
if we are not successful in obtaining a license or redesigning our product  we may be unable to sell our product and our business would suffer 
we have been  and may in the future  be a party to patent litigation  which could be expensive and divert our management s attention 
the medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights  and companies in the industry have used intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage 
we may become a party to patent infringement claims and litigation or interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office pto  to determine the priority of inventions 
the defense and prosecution of these matters are both costly and time consuming 
we may need to commence proceedings against others to enforce our patents  to protect our trade secrets or know how or to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
these proceedings would result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel 
a third party  ovion  inc  brought to our attention a patent and certain claims from a pending patent application owned by it 
ovion indicated it believes that the claims of its patent and application cover essure and its use 
on october   we entered into a settlement agreement with ovion pursuant to which we received a sole  worldwide license to ovion s patent rights relative to the essure system  and ovion may not grant any additional such licenses to other parties 
the settlement agreement provided for the payment of a royalty to ovion that will be equal to of the cumulative net sales of essure in excess of million for a period of no longer than ten years 
in addition  the settlement agreement provided for a cash payment of million in the fourth quarter of as a prepaid royalty  and a license fee of million payable in our common stock in equal installments in the first and second quarters of ovion was not granted any rights to our intellectual property pursuant to the settlement agreement 
the settlement agreement was approved by the us district court for the northern district of california on november  although we have reached a settlement agreement with ovion  we still believe that some or all of ovion s claims should be included within our own patents and we have requested that the pto declare an interference 
an interference is a proceeding within the pto to determine which party was the first to invent  and which party is thereby entitled to ownership of  the claims 
we believe that we filed our patent applications for essure before ovion filed the application that issued as its patent  and that we are entitled to any patentable claims now appearing in their patent that cover our product 
we do not know whether the pto will declare an interference  whether we invented our product prior to ovion s date of invention  or whether we will prevail in an interference proceeding if it is declared by the pto 
if the pto declares an interference in our favor and we are found to have priority of invention  we may avoid having to pay ovion future royalties on the sales of our product 
an adverse determination in new litigation or interference proceedings to which we are or may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to seek licenses from third parties 
although patent and intellectual property disputes in the medical device area have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
we may be unable to obtain necessary licenses on satisfactory terms  if at all 
adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling essure 
one of the patents included in our license from target therapeutics  a division of boston scientific corporation  has been the subject of reexamination proceedings in the pto and an infringement lawsuit by target therapeutics 
we are not a party to this lawsuit 
the patent is directed to variable stiffness catheters for use with guidewires  as might be used in our future products 
although the pto reaffirmed the patent with amended claims and the lawsuit was settled  the patent could be challenged or invalidated in the future 
if this patent is invalidated  our ability to prevent others from using this proprietary technology would be compromised 
if we fail to manage any expansion  our business could be impaired 
we may in the future acquire one or more technologies  products or companies that complement our business 
we may not be able to effectively integrate these into our business and any such acquisition could bring additional risks  exposures and challenges to our company 
if we fail to manage any acquisition  our business could be impaired 
our third party manufacturer and we will depend upon third party and single source suppliers for raw materials and finished goods and we do not have forward contracts with many of these suppliers 
we and our third party manufacturer purchase both raw materials used in our product and finished goods from various suppliers  and we rely on a single source for one component of our product  the polyester fiber 
we do not have formal supply contracts with several key vendors and  accordingly  these firms may not continue to supply us or our third party manufacturer with raw materials or finished goods in sufficient quantities  or at all 
delays associated with any future raw materials or finished goods shortages could impair our sales of essure  particularly as our third party manufacturer scales up its manufacturing activities in support of united states and international commercial sales of essure 
health care reform may limit our return on our product 
the levels of revenue and profitability of medical device companies may be affected by the efforts of government and third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means 
in the united states  there have been  and we expect that there will continue to be  a number of federal  state and private proposals to control health care costs 
these proposals may contain measures intended to control public and private spending on health care as well as to provide universal public access to the health care system 
if enacted  these proposals may result in a substantial restructuring of the health care delivery system 
significant changes in the united states health care system are likely to have a substantial impact over time on the manner in which we conduct our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be exposed to product liability claims  and we have only limited insurance coverage 
the manufacture and sale of medical products involve an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims and product recalls 
we currently maintain product liability insurance with coverage limits of million per occurrence and an annual aggregate maximum of million  which we believe is comparable to that maintained by other companies of similar size serving similar markets 
however  we cannot assure you that product liability claims in connection with clinical trials or commercial sales of essure will not exceed such insurance coverage limits or that such insurance will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
insurance is expensive and in the future may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage  or a recall of our product  could cause our stock price to fall 
we may not be able to attract and retain additional key management  sales and marketing and technical personnel or we may lose existing key management  sales and marketing or technical personnel  which may delay our development and marketing efforts 
we depend on a number of key management  sales and marketing and technical personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more key employees could delay the achievement of our development and marketing objectives 
our success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified management  sales and marketing and technical personnel to meet our growth goals 
we face intense competition for qualified personnel  many of whom are often subject to competing employment offers  and we do not know whether we will be able to attract and retain such personnel 
we face intense competition  and if we are unable to compete effectively  demand for essure may be reduced 
the medical device industry is highly competitive and is characterized by rapid and significant technological change 
the length of time required for product development and regulatory approval plays an important role in a company s competitive position 
as we commercialize essure  we expect to compete with other methods of permanent contraception  in particular tubal ligation  other methods of non permanent contraception  including devices such as intrauterine devices  or iuds  vaginal rings  condoms and prescription drugs such as the birth control pill  injectable and implantable contraceptives and patches  and other companies that may develop permanent contraception devices that are similar to or otherwise compete with essure 
we are aware of a company that is in the clinical stages of development for non incisional permanent contraception devices  and other companies may develop products that could compete with essure 
competitive factors may render essure obsolete or noncompetitive or reduce demand for essure 
our future quarterly results may fluctuate 
our future revenues and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and will depend upon  among other factors the rate at which new physicians are trained  actions relating to reimbursement matters  the rate at which we establish united states and international distributors or marketing partners and the degree of their success  the extent to which essure gains market acceptance  the timing and size of distributor purchases  and introduction of competitive products 
changes in stock option accounting rules may adversely impact our reported operating results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  our stock price and our competitiveness in the employee marketplace 
technology companies like ours have a history of using broad based employee stock option programs to hire  incentivize and retain our workforce in a competitive marketplace 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas allowed companies the choice of either using a fair value method of accounting for options  which would result in expense recognition for all options granted  or using an intrinsic value method  as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  with a pro forma disclosure of the impact on net income loss of using the fair value option expense recognition method 
we had elected to apply apb and accordingly we generally do not recognize any expense with respect to employee stock options as long as such options are granted at exercise prices equal to the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
in december  the fasb issued  sfas r share based payments 
we will adopt this statement on july  which is the first interim reporting period after june  this statement will have a significant impact on our consolidated statement of operations as we will be required to expense the fair value of our stock options rather than disclosing the impact on our consolidated result of operations within our footnotes in accordance with the disclosure provisions of sfas this will result in lower reported earnings per share  which could negatively impact our future stock price 
in addition  this could impact our ability to utilize broad based employee stock plans to reward employees and could result in a competitive disadvantage to us in the employee marketplace 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
interest rate risk we have been exposed to interest rate risk as it applies to interest earned on holdings of short term marketable securities 
interest rates that may affect these items in the future will depend on market conditions and may differ from the rates we have experienced in the past 
a change in interest rates would not be material to our results of operations 
we reduce the sensitivity of our results of operations to these risks by maintaining an investment portfolio  which is primarily comprised of highly rated  short term investments 
we do not hold or issue derivative  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk our expenses  except for those related to europe and australia  were denominated in us dollars 
our revenues   and of which were in foreign currencies in  and  respectively  were immaterial in relation to our overall financial position 
as a result  we have relatively little exposure for currency exchange risks and foreign exchange losses have been minimal to date 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposure denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
in the future  if we feel our foreign currency exposure has increased  we may consider entering into hedging transactions to help mitigate that risk 
as of december   a fluctuation in exchange rates of in the foreign currencies to which we are exposed would not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition
