about the company sauer danfoss inc and subsidiaries the company is a worldwide leader in the design  manufacture  and sale of engineered hydraulic and electronic systems and components that generate  transmit and control power in mobile equipment 
the company s products are used by original equipment manufacturers oems of mobile equipment  including construction  road building  agricultural  turf care and specialty equipment 
the company designs  manufactures and markets its products in the americas  europe and the asia pacific region  and markets its products throughout the rest of the world either directly or through distributors 
overview the general economy in the us improved substantially throughout the european economy generally also grew in  but at varying degrees by country  and not as substantially as the growth experienced in the us the economy in the asia pacific region remains mixed as japan s economy appears stable but government intervention has intentionally slowed the economic growth activity in china 
in the company introduced the plus operating architecture system which customers integrated into their vehicle platforms 
plus provides opportunities for growth in  in addition to the new generation of hydrostatic transmissions for vehicle propel systems that the company will introduce in expanding market share in the asia pacific region and strategic acquisitions provide additional growth opportunities for the company 
challenges in included a worldwide shortage of raw materials  particularly steel  and higher prices for these key materials 
the company was able to recover most of the increased cost of metals with price increases to customers 
the company s financial condition remains strong at december  in the company generated a record cash flow from operations of million 
the company s debt to debt plus equity ratio decreased to percent at december  compared to percent at december  based on the company s strong cash flow  strong earnings  and the positive long term outlook for its operations  the company s board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend declared in the third quarter to per share  or a percent increase from the previous dividend level of per share 
executive summary of compared to the nature of the company s operations as a global producer and supplier in the fluid power industry means the company is impacted by changes in the local economies  including currency exchange rate fluctuations 
in order to gain a better understanding of the company s base results  a financial statement user needs to understand the impact of those currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as changes resulting from strategic acquisitions 
the following table summarizes the change in the company s results from operations by separately identifying changes due to currency fluctuations  acquisitions  and the underlying change in operations from to this analysis is more consistent with how the company s management internally evaluates results 
in millions currency fluctuations acquisitions underlying increase decrease net sales gross profit of net sales selling  general and administrative research and development loss on disposal of fixed assets total operating costs operating income of net sales net interest expense other expense  net income before taxes and minority interest minority interest and equity income  net earnings before taxes of net sales income tax benefit expense net income consists of three months of operations of comatrol  which was acquired in april and the results of a japanese manufacturing location which was accounted for under the equity method of accounting in the underlying growth in sales  which excludes the effect of currency fluctuations and acquisitions  exceeded percent in  in large part due to the improving economy in the us  which not only results in increased sales within the americas  but also increased export business from the company s european and asia pacific customers 
the company s sales growth exceeded the market growth of percent  which the company determined based on the volume of units sold in the regions in which the company distributes its products 
in the second half of  the company passed the increased cost of metals used in the manufacture of its products on to its customers  resulting in additional revenue of approximately million in margin on total net sales increased over two percentage points due to several factors  including spreading the fixed production costs over a higher volume of units produced  reduced field recall costs  and beginning to realize the benefits of the restructurings which have occurred in recent years 
management of the company generally targets overall margin improvement of to percent on each dollar of incremental sales based on the cost structure it has in place and the intent of reinvesting in the business for future growth 
this target was met in as the margin on the underlying increase in net sales exceeded percent 
the company continues to pursue lean manufacturing efficiencies and expand the use of six sigma quality tools to reduce waste and improve processes throughout the company 
the company s continuing focus on quality reduced the level of field recalls in the current year with no individually significant field recalls in in the company incurred expense of million on a pre tax basis due to five unrelated field recalls 
increased emphasis on global logistics  selective outsourcing  lower cost manufacturing methods  and a consolidated network of authorized service centers also contributed to the gross margin improving to percent in management is pleased with the improved profit margins that the company achieved in  however increased operating costs partially offset the increased gross profit 
in  the company incurred a total of million of restructuring costs on a pre tax basis related to the european sales and distributions operation  discussed below  and reorganization at certain production locations 
the management rationalization within the work function segment  partial consolidation of the non manufacturing functions of the controls segment within the us and completion of the relocation of the west branch  iowa  work function operations resulted in pre tax costs of million 
in pre tax restructuring costs related to production locations totaled million 
the lower restructuring costs in resulted in and million improvement in cost of sales and loss on disposal of fixed assets respectively  compared to the costs in selling  general and administrative related to restructuring were million higher in than in the following table summarizes the significant costs  on a pretax basis  included in the selling  general  and administrative line that contributed to the million increase in compared to discussion of each item is included in the previous paragraph or in the paragraphs following the table in millions increase manufacturing location restructuring european sales and distribution operations restructuring development of common business system management incentive plans sarbanes oxley section compliance total the restructuring of the company s sales and distribution operations in europe to consolidate inventory  warehouse and distribution operations as well as streamline delivery directly from the manufacturing locations to the customer  which began in  was substantially completed in also contributing to the increase in selling  general and administrative costs in was the continuing development and implementation of a common business system to standardize business processes and provide a single interface to direct oem customers and suppliers 
the investment in the common business system will drive improved operational efficiency  customer service  and financial performance in future years after it is implemented at all company locations over the three year period ending in as of the first quarter of three locations are operating on the new business system and three additional locations will implement the new system later in the improved financial performance of the company in resulted in additional costs associated with both its long term and short term incentive plans 
based on established performance targets for the incentive plans and the company s outlook on future operating results the expense in associated with the incentive plans is expected to approximate the expense 
the company implemented a new financial reporting quality system  an overall quality improvement system for finance and information technology  to document and test internal controls as required under section of the sarbanes oxley act of the million of costs incurred in for the financial reporting quality system relate to fees paid to external consultants  in addition to increased external audit fees related to the report on management s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting that is required under the sarbanes oxley act of the company continues to deliver top line sales growth exceeding the market growth in the markets that it serves 
the company s percent compound annual growth rate in reported sales over the past ten years has outpaced the general growth within the industry 
to obtain the company s goal of gaining market share and delivering long term profitable growth the entire organization is focused on the following strategic operating goals increase the component and system content on customers vehicles 
develop uses for the company s technology on new types of mobile applications 
continue to pursue optimal operating efficiencies though continued use of lean manufacturing 
further expand the company s global presence 
pursue appropriate acquisition targets to compliment the company s product portfolio 
operating results compared to sales growth by market the following table summarizes the company s sales growth by market 
the table and following discussion is on a comparable basis  which excludes the effects of acquisitions and currency fluctuations 
americas asia pacific europe total agriculture construction road building turf care specialty distribution agriculture the agricultural market in the americas benefited from record crop production and strong livestock markets in the us in the general increase in the agriculture market resulted in large sales increases to the large oems in the americas market for all products 
although asia pacific provides a smaller portion of the company s sales in the agricultural market than the americas and europe  the percent increase in sales represents continuing growth in this region  primarily in japan 
the agriculture market in europe remained flat in  although sales growth did occur in the fourth quarter due to increased sales to several oems 
construction sales within the construction market increased by percent in the americas due to a combination of increased production by oems and share growth as sauer danfoss began to supply all hydraulic system content on an application produced by a large oem  including product previously supplied by a competitor 
the company experienced growth in japan due to an increase in exports of skid steer loaders  however this increase was partially offset by the chinese government intervention to slow down the economy 
exports also generated additional sales in the european region 
demand for transit mixers has had a positive effect on the european sales in the construction market 
road building the americas road building market experienced strong growth in with sales growth to all oems 
key customers in the asia pacific region are located in china so the government economic restrictions in place during the last half of the year had a negative effect on sales growth  however growth was strong in the first half of the year  resulting in growth for the full year of percent 
increased customer exports contributed to the growth in european sales in the road building market 
sales to several european customers experienced strong growth in the fourth quarter of turf care the company s primary business within this market comes from products produced for the consumer and commercial turf care markets in the americas region 
the consumer zero turn radius machines continue to gain market share from traditional lawn and garden tractors  which has led to increased sales of the company s new zero turn transaxle product that was introduced late in in addition  the company experienced market share gains from sales of low speed  high torque motors produced in its nordborg  denmark  facility  which contributed to the percent growth in sales during specialty vehicles sales into the specialty vehicle markets increased in all regions in growth in the aerial lift and forklift markets  after several years of decreased demand  contributed strongly to the percent growth in specialty vehicles 
sales growth is also occurring in the waste management and waste recycling markets in asia pacific and the telehandler and forestry markets in europe 
sales in the european region  which comprises the majority of the specialty market  has not recovered as quickly as the americas and the asia pacific markets 
distribution products related to all of the above markets are sold to distributors  who then serve smaller oems 
order backlog the following table shows the company s order backlog and orders written activity for and  in addition to the reasons why the amounts fluctuated between years 
order backlog represents the amount of customer orders received for future shipment 
in millions currency fluctuation acquisitions underlying increase decrease americas backlog at december orders written asia pacific backlog at december orders written europe backlog at december orders written total backlog at december orders written total order backlog at the end of was million  compared to million at the end of  an increase of percent 
on a comparable basis  excluding the impact of currency fluctuation and acquisitions  order backlog increased percent over new sales orders written for were  million  an increase of percent from excluding the impact of currencies and acquisitions  total orders written in were percent above the levels 
backlog information has become less reliable as an indicator of future sales expectations as customers continue to adjust orders closer to the scheduled production dates 
the decrease in lead time may be due to customers taking advantage of reduced production cycles within the company s facilities or due to the customer s uncertainty on the outlook of their own markets 
although backlog does not predict future sales levels as reliably as in the past  the increase in backlog at december  indicates that current demand is strong and suggests strong sales in future months 
business segment results the following discussion of operating results by reportable segment relates to information as presented in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
segment income is defined as the respective segment s portion of the total company s net income  excluding net interest expense  income taxes  minority interest  and global service expenses 
propel products include hydrostatic transmissions and related products that transmit the power from the engine to the wheel to propel a vehicle 
work function products include steering motors as well as gear pumps and motors that transmit power for the work functions of the vehicle 
controls products include electrohydraulic controls  microprocessors  electric drives and valves that control and direct the power of a vehicle 
the following table provides a summary of each segment s net sales and segment income  separately identifying the impact of currency fluctuations and acquisitions in in millions currency fluctuation acquisitions underlying increase decrease net sales propel work function controls segment income loss propel work function controls global services and other expenses  net consists of three months of operations of comatrol  which was acquired in april and the results of a japanese manufacturing location which was accounted for under the equity method of accounting in propel segment the general improvement in the economy contributed to increased sales as demand from large oems and distributors increased 
increased sales of million in the america s turf care market  as mentioned in the preceding sales growth by market section  also contributed to the sales increase as consumers continue to move away from mechanical transmissions to hydrostatic transmissions 
sales  excluding increases due to fluctuations in currency and acquisitions  increased by percent in compared to due to both increased sales volumes and prices 
the propel segment converted the percent underlying increase in sales to an increase in segment income of percent  excluding the impact of currency fluctuations and acquisitions 
this million increase in underlying segment income is percent of the underlying sales increase  meeting the company s internal expectations 
the increase in segment income was partly due to spreading fixed costs over a higher volume of units produced 
however  the company has also continued to identify process improvements and cost reduction opportunities through the use of six sigma quality tools and the pursuit of lean manufacturing efficiency 
in recent years propel segment income has been negatively impacted by increased price pressures due to customers demanding price concessions 
in  a focus on global purchasing initiatives reduced material costs by sourcing components to global suppliers who were more cost effective than previous suppliers and to outsource the manufacturing of components when it was cost effective to do so 
in  the propel segment incurred million of field recall costs as a result of four separate quality issues 
the company focused on revising processes to reduce the level of field recall costs which contributed to the improved segment income in work function segment sales in the work function segment increased by percent  excluding the effect of currency fluctuations and acquisitions in compared to demand for work function product has been high throughout resulting in production operating at near full capacity at certain work function locations 
due to high demand  the work function segment has incurred million of airfreight costs in order to meet customer delivery requirements in  which negatively impacted segment income 
however the increased airfreight costs were more than offset by reduced restructuring costs and the benefits that are beginning to be realized from this restructuring 
in the company incurred approximately million of costs related to the relocation of operations from its facilities in sturtevant  wisconsin  and west branch  iowa  to its locations in nordborg  denmark  wroclaw  poland  freeport  illinois  and lawrence  kansas 
the relocation of the west branch location was completed in  which  combined with additional reorganization within the work function segment resulted in approximately million of restructuring costs in in connection with the restructuring  the company rationalized and outsourced certain low volume product lines which is also contributing to the improved segment income in the current year 
segment income in  excluding the effect of currency fluctuations and acquisitions  more than doubled from the level 
the increased segment income derived from the underlying sales growth amounted to over percent of the incremental sales growth  achieving management expectations 
management of the company expects this improved profitability to continue as the work function segment continues to realize the benefits from previous restructurings 
controls segment the controls segment experienced sales growth of approximately percent in  excluding the effect of currency fluctuations and acquisitions 
the plus vehicle architecture was introduced during  and although sales for the year were not a significant portion of the controls segment total sales  the introduction of the product has been well received 
the million increase in segment income is percent of the underlying sales increase of million  which is in line with management s expectations 
global services and other expenses  net segment costs in global services and other expenses  net relate to internal global service departments  along with the operating costs of the company s executive offices 
global services include costs such as consulting for special projects  tax and accounting fees paid to outside third parties  certain insurance premiums  and the amortization of intangible assets from certain business combinations 
the million increase in global services relates to three items 
first  the company continues to incur costs  million in  to develop a common business system for all of the company s worldwide operations 
costs to develop the common business system increased by million from the amount of million 
second  due to the company s improved financial performance in costs related to the company s incentive plans increased by million 
outside service costs to assist in implementing the new requirements to document and test internal controls under section of the sarbanes oxley act of were million in  an increase of million compared to costs incurred in income taxes the company s effective tax rate was percent in a decrease of previously recorded accruals for outstanding irs audit issues on prior year s tax returns has reduced the effective tax rate 
the american job creations act of introduced a limited time percent dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings 
this deduction would result in an approximate percent federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings 
to qualify for the deduction certain criteria must be met  including that the earnings must be reinvested in the us pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan established by the company s chief executive officer and approved by the company s board of directors 
the company has started an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision and may elect to apply the provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in however  the company does not expect to be able to complete its evaluation until after congress or the treasury department provides additional clarifying language on key elements of the provision 
assuming such clarifications are made  the company expects to complete its evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision by the end of the second quarter in the range of possible amounts that the company is considering for repatriation under this provision is between and million 
while the company estimates the related potential range of additional income tax is between and million  the range is subject to change based on the technical correction legislation that is expected to be passed 
executive summary of compared to the following table summarizes the company s and results from operations by separately identifying the impact of currency fluctuations and acquisitions 
this analysis is more consistent with how the company internally evaluates its results 
in millions currency fluctuations acquisitions underlying increase decrease net sales gross profit of sales selling  general and administrative research and development loss on disposal of fixed assets total operating costs operating income of sales net interest expense other expense  net income before taxes and minority interest minority interest and equity income  net earnings before taxes of sales income tax benefit expense net income excludes results of equity ownership in comatrol 
represents full year results of comatrol  which was accounted for under the equity method in the first quarter of and consolidated the remainder of  and the first quarter results of thrige electric  which was acquired in the second quarter of the company exceeded its own expectations in terms of sales growth by posting a percent sales growth  excluding the effects of currency fluctuations and acquisitions in over this sales increase exceeded the market growth of approximately percent  which the company determined based on the volume of units sold in the regions in which the company distributes its products 
however  the margin returns on the increased sales levels in did not meet the company s expectations 
operating margins and net income margins were all lower in than in  due in part to some strategic business decisions that the company made during the year that were not originally planned  but also due to unexpected costs 
these items are discussed in more detail below 
the most significant item to impact the company s financial performance in was the decision to close and relocate two of its manufacturing locations in the us these facilities were located in sturtevant  wisconsin  and west branch  iowa 
the total costs incurred in related to the closure of these facilities amounted to million on a pretax basis 
these costs included impairment charges on property  plant and equipment  accelerated depreciation  employee severance costs  inventory disposal costs  costs to move people and equipment to other facilities  and manufacturing inefficiencies during the shut down and move of operations from these two facilities 
approximately million was recorded as loss on fixed assets 
the remaining and million affected the cost of sales and selling  general and administrative lines  respectively  of the income statement 
the company did not incur any restructuring costs in and expects to incur only million of costs related to the west branch restructuring in the company s financial results were also significantly impacted by several large field recall issues 
the field recalls amounted to a total of million on a pretax basis and impacted the gross profit line of both the propel and work function segments 
while the company was not pleased to have incurred these field recalls  they related to five individual defects that were not interrelated 
the company is diligently working to understand the root cause of these defects and to enhance its processes in order to prevent this order of magnitude of field recall costs from occurring in the future 
however  as the company has identified under its critical accounting estimates  warranty and field recall costs can be a recurring part of its business due to the high precision and technical nature of its products and processes 
there can be no assurances as to the frequency or significance of these costs in the future 
in addition to the above items  the company incurred million of expense to begin the restructuring of its sales and distribution operations in europe  intended to reduce future operating costs by streamlining delivery directly from the manufacturing locations to the customer 
the company incurred million of expense to begin the implementation of a common business system to standardize business processes and provide a single interface to direct oem customers and suppliers 
the investment in the common business system will drive improved operational efficiency  customer service  and financial performance in future years 
in  the company also incurred million of outside consulting fees related to the initial work to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of these costs are all reflected in the selling  general and administrative expenses line on the consolidated statement of income and are anticipated to continue in at varying degrees 
the items discussed above negatively impacted income from operations by million 
excluding these items  the company would have experienced a million increase in operating income on the sales increase of million  excluding the effects of currency and acquisitions  or approximately percent of the incremental sales growth 
the company generally targets overall margin improvement of to percent on each dollar of incremental sales based on the cost structure it has in place and the intent of reinvesting in the business for future growth 
additionally  the company experienced deterioration in gross profit margins due to the impact of the weakening us currency on product sold in the us that was manufactured outside the us see further discussion of currency risk below under market risk 
based on the ongoing operational performance  the company is not meeting these internal targets 
operating results compared to sales growth by market the following table summarizes the company s sales growth by market 
the table and following discussion is on a comparable basis  which excludes acquisitions and currency fluctuations 
americas asia pacific europe total agriculture construction road building turf care specialty distribution agriculture the agriculture market increased in all regions of the world during after several years of very depressed sales volumes 
the asia pacific region  while up significantly  is off of a relatively small base compared to the rest of the world that the company serves 
of particular note is that the increase in europe was driven primarily by new projects with several large customers that began production during in the americas  the company had increased business from all of its major oems in the fourth quarter of compared to construction in the construction market  the company also experienced sales gains in all regions of the world 
the americas construction market was moderately up over  with the fourth quarter showing continued strengthening 
in europe  the increase in shipments was led by the smaller and mid sized manufacturers in this market 
in general  the outlook for this market in europe is positive for many of the company s major customers 
the asia pacific region was led by the strong transit mixer business in australia  which is expected to continue into the first half of road building the road building market was weak in the americas and europe with both being down from in the americas  this was driven primarily by a generally soft market and also by the lack of funding by state governments for highway projects 
while the market in europe was down  the outlook for is generally positive 
road building in the asia pacific region was led by many large projects in china such as preparation for the olympics in beijing  installing infrastructure for water transfer from the south of china to the north  and for national highway projects 
this increase offset the declines in both the americas and europe 
turf care the company s primary business within this market comes from products produced for the consumer and commercial turf care markets in the americas region 
consumers continue to move away from mechanical transmissions on these machines and the introduction of zero turn radius machines being sold through retail outlets is helping to continue to fuel growth in this market 
specialty vehicles sales into the specialty vehicle markets were down across all regions 
this is a trend that has been occurring for the past couple of years  primarily in the aerial lift and forklift markets 
management believes that the aerial lift market has finally stabilized in the americas and that the outlook in europe is for an upturn in the forklift market in order backlog the following table shows the company s order backlog and orders written activity for and  in addition to the reasons why the amounts fluctuated between years 
order backlog represents the amount of customer orders received for future shipment 
in millions currency fluctuation acquisitions underlying increase decrease americas backlog at december orders written asia pacific backlog at december orders written europe backlog at december orders written total backlog at december orders written total order backlog at the end of was million  compared to million at the end of  an increase of percent 
on a comparable basis  excluding the impact of currency exchange fluctuation and acquisitions  order backlog remained flat with year end levels 
new sales orders written for were  million  an increase of percent from excluding the impact of currencies and acquisitions  total orders written in were only percent above the levels 
as the company has noted in earlier communications  customers continue to adjust orders closer to the scheduled production dates  often within the scheduled shipping month 
in some cases  this is a result of the customer s uncertainty with respect to the outlook of their own markets  but it is also a sign that customers are taking advantage of reduced production cycles within the company s facilities 
in either case  the company s order and backlog information has become less reliable as an indicator of future expectations 
overall  the company has been able to achieve solid sales growth through its strategies to continue to develop new vehicle applications and to expand the content supplied for each vehicle by selling system solutions and integrating electronics with hydraulics 
business segment results the following table provides a summary of each segment s sales and segment income on a comparable basis  excluding acquisitions and currency fluctuations 
in millions currency fluctuation acquisitions underlying increase decrease net sales propel work function controls segment income loss propel work function controls global services and other expenses  net propel segment there are two primary reasons for the increase in the propel segments net sales in the first reason is the continued growth in the turf care market in the americas 
as mentioned in the preceding sales growth by market section  the move away from mechanical transmissions to hydrostatic transmissions and the zero turn radius mowers are leading the way for this growth 
the other factor of growth in the propel segment during came from the increased sales volume in the asia pacific region as china and japan experienced increased sales  primarily in the construction and road building markets as mentioned above 
the propel segment income generated on the increased sales only amounted to percent of the incremental sales over  which is considered very substandard by the company s internal standards 
during  the propel segment incurred million of field recall costs as a result of four separate quality issues at several large oem customers 
each of these instances had its own unique root cause and the company is working diligently to put the proper processes and tools in place to ensure that these types of recalls do not occur in the future 
without these field recall costs  propel segment income would have increased million  or percent of the incremental sales increase 
the propel segment income has also been impacted by increased price pressures which the company has experienced in recent years 
the propel segment is predominantly a mature product line with enhancements coming primarily from the addition of electronic controls 
consequently  customers in this market have been very aggressive in demanding price concessions 
to the extent the company concedes price reductions without offsetting these concessions with cost reductions  the price reduction negatively impacts the segment profitability 
in order to combat this impact  the propel segment is focused on utilizing global purchasing initiatives to lower part costs through sourcing components to more cost effective global suppliers and to outsource components where the company does not believe there is a manufacturing advantage 
work function segment while the work function segment experienced net sales growth over the prior year of million  segment income declined by million from of this decline  approximately million was a result of the company s decision during to shutdown and relocate two of its manufacturing plants in north america 
in the second and third quarters of  the company shut down its steering unit manufacturing operation in sturtevant  wisconsin  and relocated the operations to its facilities in nordborg  denmark  and wroclaw  poland 
the costs incurred for this closure  net of savings realized already during was approximately million 
during the third quarter of  the company made the decision to shut down and relocate its west branch  iowa  plant 
the majority of the costs to close and relocate this facility were incurred in and amounted to approximately million 
the majority of the manufacturing operations at west branch were transferred to the company s freeport  illinois  and lawrence  kansas  facilities 
in addition  the company successfully rationalized and outsourced certain low volume product lines that will also help to improve profitability in this segment in future periods 
the work function segment also incurred million of field recall costs due to a quality problem with one particular product at one customer 
this segment is also working to implement the proper processes and tools to prevent costs of this magnitude in the future 
controls segment the controls segment experienced sales growth that was in line with the general market trend in which the company operates 
on the positive side  the controls segment income was a very strong percent of the incremental sales growth  much higher than even the company s internal expectations 
however  the controls segment income in was negatively impacted by a million product rationalization charge 
excluding this item  the controls segment income increased percent of the incremental sales growth that still exceeded the company s internal expectations 
global services and other expenses  net the company s global services and other expenses  net segment incurs costs related to internal global service departments  along with the operating costs of the company s executive offices that were established in in lincolnshire  illinois 
worldwide services such as tax and accounting fees paid to outside third parties  certain insurance premiums  and the amortization of intangible assets from certain business combinations are also included in this classification 
the majority of the increase in this area relates to three items initial costs incurred to begin implementation of a common business system for all of the company s worldwide operations  outside service costs to assist in meeting the new requirements regarding internal controls under the sarbanes oxley act of  and the additional costs related to the company s executive office in place for the full year of compared to only six months of income taxes the company had a tax benefit of million in even though it reported pre tax net income of million 
the tax benefit is due to two primary factors 
first  the majority of the restructuring costs were incurred in the us  which are benefited at an effective corporate tax rate of percent  whereas  the majority of the earnings  primarily european based  are taxed at various statutory rates averaging approximately percent 
second  the company s operations in china and slovakia generated income in but there is no tax expense on these amounts as both countries have tax loss carryforwards with no previously recorded tax benefit 
the company expects its overall tax rate to return to a rate closer to the statutory rate in market risk the company is naturally exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and  interest rates 
foreign currency changes the company has historically not entered into any type of foreign currency hedging or derivative arrangements to manage its exposure to fluctuations in the foreign currency markets 
however  during  the company entered into a foreign currency forward contract to protect against the effects of foreign currency fluctuations for a loan to the u 
s 
holding company from a danish bank denominated in euros 
the company adjusts the carrying value of the contract to market which resulted in offsetting approximately million of foreign currency loss that would have resulted from the dollar weakening against the euro during the company has operations and sells its products in many different countries of the world and therefore  conducts its business in various currencies 
the company s financial statements  which are presented in us dollars  can be impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk 
translation risk is the risk that the financial statements of the company  for a particular period or as of a certain date  may be affected by changes in the exchange rates that are used to translate the financial statements of the company s operations from foreign currencies into us dollars 
transaction risk is the risk from the company receiving its sale proceeds or holding its assets in a currency different from that in which it pays its expenses and holds its liabilities 
with respect to transaction risk  the impact on the company s operating results has not historically been significant 
in previous years  the company had been well balanced between its us and european operations because the company generated its sales in the same country in which it incurred its expenses  or shipped products between geographic regions on a balanced basis 
however  in recent years the balance is beginning to shift and the amount of sales made in us dollars is increasing  whereas the production costs are in a currency other than the us dollar 
in the company sold a total of million into the us of product that had been produced in european based currencies compared to sales into europe of million of product produced in us dollars 
this imbalance had a significant impact on the bottom line results of the company in as the dollar became weaker in comparison to other currencies during the company produces and sells its product in several regions of the world  however the us and european transactions comprise the majority of the imbalance between regions 
the company is currently taking steps to analyze and understand this impact globally 
based on its analysis  the company may decide to re source certain operations or use hedging instruments in the future in order to protect against this margin erosion 
additionally  the company is impacted by translation risk in terms of comparing results from period to period 
fluctuations of currencies against the us dollar can be substantial and therefore significantly impact comparisons with prior periods 
the translation impact on making prior period comparisons with respect to the company s net sales can be material 
as shown in the table below  the translation impact on net sales has been significant in recent years 
percentage sales growth over prior year as reported without currency translation impact during  the us dollar continued to weaken substantially against most foreign currencies  especially the euro 
between december  and december   the us dollar weakened by percent against the euro  which followed a percent and percent weakening in the previous two years 
this has resulted in approximately percent of the company s total balance sheet being stated percent higher than the prior year since roughly percent of the company s total assets and liabilities are denominated in the euro 
as shown above  translation does affect comparisons between periods 
interest rate changes the company uses interest rate swap agreements on a limited basis to manage the interest rate risk on the total debt portfolio 
the company was a party to three interest rate swap agreements  with a combined notional amount of million euro  that require the company to pay interest at a fixed rate and receive interest at a variable rate 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements is recorded as a liability of million on the balance sheet at december   with the offset recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as the derivatives are accounted for using hedge accounting 
the interest rate swap agreements mature at various dates through march the following table summarizes the maturity of the company s debt obligations for fixed and variable rate debt amounts in millions fixed rate debt variable rate debt thereafter total includes total principal repayments of million on variable rate debt that the rate has been fixed through the use of interest rate swaps 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of liquidity have been from internally generated cash flows from operations and from borrowings under its committed and uncommitted  unsecured  credit facilities 
because of the multiple funding sources that have been and continue to be available to the company  the company expects to have sufficient sources of liquidity to meet its funding needs 
the company has historically accessed diverse funding sources  including short term and long term unsecured bank lines of credit in the united states  europe and asia  as well as private securitization markets in the united states 
in addition  the company has access to unsecured bank lines of credit with various banks from around the world see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company has a multicurrency revolving credit facility that permits unsecured borrowings up to million through september at december  the company had million outstanding under the revolving credit facility  including amounts borrowed under ancillary facilities 
the company is required to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit facility 
the commitment fee totaled million in the company is required to meet certain financial covenants under this facility as described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company was in compliance with the covenants at december  and is not aware of any circumstances currently that would impact compliance during the next twelve months 
cash flows from operations the company s cash provided from operations in was a record million  percent higher than the million generated in  primarily due to increased net income 
excluding the impact of currency fluctuations and acquisitions  the accounts receivable balance increased percent in compared to  due to the increased sales in at december  there was an additional million invested in inventories  excluding the impact of currency and acquisition  compared to december  as the company has anticipated increased demand for product in early and has prepared to meet this demand 
the accounts payable balance increased in fourth quarter due to the increased inventory purchases 
overall  the company s cash balances decreased by million which is in line with the company s overall goal to minimize the amount of cash on its balance sheet as long as it has outstanding bank borrowings 
at the end of  over million of the company s cash resided in china  and an additional million was located in brazil 
these amounts were similar to the amounts of cash at each of these locations at the end of due to the nature of governmental and other regulatory controls  it is extremely difficult to move cash out of these countries for reasons other than payment for goods shipped into these countries 
as the company continues to look at expanding its manufacturing capabilities in low cost regions  the company will look to utilize the cash already located in these countries to fund these expansions 
cash used in investing activities the company has continued to selectively invest in capital equipment for its manufacturing plants for more efficient manufacturing processes and for new product development 
in addition  in the company invested over million in the development of a new common business system which will be implemented at all locations over the next three years 
during the company completed the acquisition of a company  as the stock was purchased over three years 
the final percent ownership was purchased for a net cash outlay of million 
see the discussion of business combinations below and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
cash used in financing activities the company continues to pay dividends to stockholders on a quarterly basis 
the company s board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend declared to per quarter in the third quarter based on the company s strong cash flow  strong earnings  and the positive long term outlook for its operations 
this was a percent increase from the previous dividend level of per quarter 
total dividends paid in were million 
the company has also repaid million of outstanding borrowings in in addition  the company periodically makes distributions to its minority interest partners from its various joint venture activities 
the distributions can vary from year to year depending on the amount of undistributed earnings of the businesses and the needs of the partners 
contractual cash obligations the majority of the company s contractual obligations to make cash payments to third parties are for financing obligations 
these include future lease payments under both operating and capital leases 
the following table discloses the company s future commitments under contractual obligations as of december  contractual cash obligations total thereafter long term debt interest on long term debt  capital leases operating leases rental agreements with related party danfoss a s total contractual cash obligations the following assumptions are used in the calculation of the contractual cash obligations the annual amount borrowed under revolving credit agreements does not change from the million borrowed at december   through the maturity date of the agreements 
the rate of interest on variable rate debt of percent will not change from december  commitments denominated in a currency other than the us dollar are translated at the december  exchange rate 
in addition to the above contractual obligations  the company has certain other funding needs that are non contractual by nature  including funding of certain pension plans 
for  the company anticipates contributing million to its us and us pension and health benefit plans 
there are no plans to fund the german pension plan  which is customary in that country 
other matters critical accounting estimates the sec s guidance surrounding the disclosure of critical accounting estimates requires disclosures about estimates a company makes in applying its accounting policies 
however  such discussion is limited to critical accounting estimates  or those that management believes meet two criteria the accounting estimate must require a company to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made  and different estimates that the company reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  must have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
besides the estimates that meet the two criteria for a critical estimate above  the company makes many other accounting estimates in preparing its financial statements and related disclosures 
all estimates  whether or not deemed critical  can affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates are based on experience and information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements 
materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known  including estimates not deemed critical under the sec s guidance 
the discussion below should be read in conjunction with disclosures elsewhere in this discussion and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements related to estimates  uncertainties  contingencies  and new accounting standards 
significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f the development and selection of accounting estimates  including those deemed critical  and the associated disclosures in this discussion  have been discussed by management with the audit committee of the board of directors 
inventory valuation as a manufacturer in the capital goods industry  inventory is a substantial portion of the assets of the company  amounting to almost percent of total assets at december  the company must periodically evaluate the carrying value of its inventory to assess the proper valuation 
this includes recording period adjustments as needed to cover losses in the normal course of operation  provide for excess and obsolete inventory  and ensure that inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
on a quarterly basis  management within each segment performs an analysis of the underlying inventory to identify the need for appropriate writedowns to cover each of these items 
in doing so  management applies consistent practices based upon historical data such as actual loss experience  past and projected usage  actual margins generated from trade sales of its products  and finally its best judgment to estimate the appropriate carrying value of the inventory 
warranty provisions the company warrants its various products over differing periods depending upon the type of product and application 
consequently  the company records liabilities for the estimated warranty costs that may be incurred under its basic warranty based on past trends of actual warranty claims compared to the actual sales levels to which those claims apply 
these liabilities are accrued at the time the sales of the products are recorded 
factors that affect the company s warranty liability include the number of units in the field currently under warranty  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims on those units and the cost per claim to satisfy the company s warranty obligation 
the anticipated rate of warranty claims is the primary factor impacting the company s estimated warranty obligation 
each quarter  the company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary 
in addition to its normal warranty liability  the company  from time to time in the normal course of business  incurs costs to repair or replace defective products with a specific customer or group of customers 
the company refers to these as field recalls and in these instances  the company will record a specific provision for the expected costs it will incur to repair or replace these products utilizing information from customers and internal information regarding the specific cost of materials and labor 
typically  field recalls are infrequent in occurrence  however  when they occur  field recalls can be for a large number of units and quite costly to rectify 
because of the sporadic and infrequent nature of field recalls  and due to the extreme range of costs associated with field recalls  the company cannot accurately estimate these costs at the time the products are sold 
therefore  these costs are recorded at the time information becomes known to the company 
as the field recalls are settled  the company relieves the specific liability related to that field recall 
these specific field recall liabilities are reviewed at least on a quarterly basis 
long lived asset recovery a significant portion of the company s total assets consist of property  plant and equipment pp e and definite life intangibles  as well as goodwill 
changes in technology or in the company s intended use of these assets  as well as changes in the broad global economy in which the company operates  may cause the estimated period of use or the carrying value of these assets to change 
this requires the company to periodically assess the estimated useful lives of its assets in order to match  through depreciation and amortization  the cost of those assets with the benefits derived over the period of usefulness 
the useful lives of these assets can be shortened through greater use due to volume increases  rapidly changing technology such as the use of electronics and computer operated controls  and through inadequate maintenance 
despite management s best efforts to determine the appropriate useful lives of its equipment  certain situations arise that lead to an asset or group of assets becoming impaired  meaning their economic value becomes less than the value at which the company is carrying the asset on its books 
examples of these situations are product rationalization efforts or restructuring of manufacturing facilities 
when these situations arise  the company tests the assets for impairment and will write down the asset in the period when the impairment becomes known 
in addition  goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually 
if information would become known that would change the depreciable rate of the company s assets by percent  recorded depreciation expense would have been impacted by approximately million 
valuation of trade receivables the company records trade receivables due from its customers at the time a sale is recorded in accordance with its revenue recognition policy 
the future collectability of these amounts can be impacted by the company s collection efforts  the financial stability of its customers  and the general economic climate in which it operates 
the company applies a consistent practice of establishing an allowance for accounts that it believes may become uncollectible through reviewing the historical aging of its receivables  looking at the historical losses incurred as a percentage of net sales  and by monitoring the financial strength of its customers 
in addition  local customary practices have to be taken into account due to varying payment terms being applied in various parts of the world where the company conducts its business 
if the company becomes aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  where it has filed for bankruptcy  the company establishes a specific allowance for the potential bad debt to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount it reasonably believes will be collected 
the valuation of trade receivables is performed quarterly 
workers compensation the company has an insurance policy to cover workers compensation claims in the united states  in which the company pays the first million per claim  per incident 
the company establishes its workers compensation reserve based on historic growth factors of claims and an estimate of incurred  but not reported claims 
this analysis is performed on a quarterly basis  or more frequently if factors dictate a more frequent review 
pensions the company has noncontributory defined benefit pension plans for a majority of its employees 
in certain countries  such as the united states and the united kingdom  these plans are funded with plan assets whereas in other countries such as germany  the plans are completely unfunded  which is customary 
the measurement of the company s pension obligations and costs is dependent on a variety of assumptions determined by management and used by the company s actuaries 
these assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and other experience 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
the plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates inflation salary growth expected return on plan assets retirement rates mortality rates the company bases the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at or near year end on corporate long term bonds rated aa 
the inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
the salary growth assumptions reflect the company s long term actual experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
the expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations  investment strategy and the views of investment managers and other large pension plan sponsors 
retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience and standard industry actuarial tables  respectively 
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods 
the company s funding policy for the us plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement of the employee retirement income security act of  plus any additional amounts the company may deem to be appropriate 
for  the company anticipates contributing million to its us plans and million to its us plans 
postretirement benefits other than pensions the company provides postretirement health care benefits for certain employee groups in the united states 
this plan is contributory and contains certain other cost sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance 
the company does not pre fund this plan and has the right to modify or terminate this plan in the future 
the postretirement liability  which is determined on an actuarial basis  is recognized in the company s consolidated balance sheets and the postretirement expense is recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
the company must determine the actuarial assumption for the discount rate used to reflect the time value of money in the calculation of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the end of the current year and to determine the postretirement cost for the subsequent year 
for guidance in determining this rate  the company looks at investment yield trends available near year end on corporate bonds rated aa 
in addition  the company must determine the actuarial assumption for the health care cost trend rate used in the calculation of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the end of the current year and to determine the net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the subsequent year 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information on the assumptions used as of december  as of december   a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would impact the expense recognized in by million and would affect the post retirement benefit obligation by million 
deferred income taxes tax regulations may require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements 
some of the differences are permanent  such as expenses which are not deductible on a tax return  and some of the differences are temporary  such as depreciation expense 
timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally are attributable to items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in a tax return in future years but the amount has already been included as an expense in the financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent deductions which have been taken on the tax return but have not been recognized as expense in the financial statements 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
new accounting policies in may the financial accounting standards board fasb issued staff position fsp  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernizaton act of the act which replaced fsp of the same name 
the act introduced a prescription drug benefit under medicare part d  as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
the company believes its retiree health and accident plan is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d and eligible for the federal subsidy 
the company determined that the impact of the act on the financial statements is not material and therefore is not considered a significant event 
the effects of the act were incorporated in the measurement of plan assets and obligation that was completed as of december  resulting in a decrease of million in the amount of unrecognized actuarial loss disclosed in note the effects of the act will be amortized over the expected remaining life of the plan participants  resulting in a reduction to the postretirement benefit expense of approximately million annually through the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities in december  which requires variable interest entities to be consolidated by the party determined to be the primary beneficiary 
a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected residual returns  or both  as a result of holding the variable interest 
the company adopted fin no 
r in the first quarter of  consolidating one entity which was previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting  with no material effect on the financial statements

the revised standard requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant with the cost recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
the effective date for the company to adopt this standard is the third quarter of as the company is currently accounting for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
the impact of adopting sfas no 
r is not expected to be significant on the company s financial position or net income 
in november the fasb issued sfas no

business combination during the second quarter  the company exercised its option to acquire the remaining percent of the outstanding shares of comatrol spa for approximately million 
in the second quarter of  the company purchased percent of the outstanding shares of comatrol  increasing it ownership to percent and therefore began to consolidate the financial results of the business 
prior to purchasing its controlling interest in comatrol  the company accounted for the results of its percent ownership interest  acquired in the first quarter of  under the equity method of accounting
