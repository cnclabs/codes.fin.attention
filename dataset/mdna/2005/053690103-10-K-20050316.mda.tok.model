item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
avigen s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed herein and in risk factors under item overview we are focused on developing innovative therapeutics to treat serious disorders  primarily for neurological conditions 
since our inception  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development activities  primarily with early stage research in the field of gene therapy  which led to our initiation of three separate phase i clinical trials under three fda approved inds 
we currently have one ongoing phase i ii clinical trial which uses aav vectors to treat parkinson s disease 
we are shifting our focus from dna based drugs to more conventional small molecule therapeutics and are actively seeking to identify and acquire rights to later stage product candidates with experience in human clinical trials 
gene therapy has proven to be a challenging field 
despite our numerous discoveries and accomplishments  our development programs have uncovered new scientific challenges  and the pace of our clinical trials suggests that these programs will require more time and investment to complete 
these factors have led our management to modify its near term strategy to restructure our portfolio and focus on acquiring or licensing rights to more conventional pharmaceutical candidates 
our history since our inception  our research and development activities have primarily focused on the development of our proprietary gene delivery platform technology based on adeno associated virus vectors  known as aav vectors  and the development and clinical testing of our dna based treatments for hemophilia and certain neurological diseases 
these gene delivery technologies are supported by a broad base of proprietary intellectual property that we have assembled covering methods of transferring genes into cells  high yield processes to manufacture contaminant free aav vectors  specific genes of interest  specific disease indications  and other proprietary technologies and processes 
in addition  we have built the manufacturing capacity necessary to produce clinical grade aav vectors and our other dna based treatments to support the research efforts and clinical trial needs of ourselves and our collaboration partners  and we believe this manufacturing capacity will also support the commercial needs of many potential gene delivery applications 
in may  we suspended subject enrollment in our phase i clinical trial for hemophilia b in order to focus our development efforts and resources on our other development programs for neurological disorders 
in july  in response to this strategic realignment  we reduced our staff level by employees  or approximately 
we incurred a charge of approximately  for severance payments and other termination related benefits and estimate that the future annual savings in personnel costs  including salaries  benefits and temporary staffing  will approximate million 
in august  we received authorization from the fda to initiate a phase i ii clinical trial of av  our drug candidate for the treatment of parkinson s disease 
in december  we enrolled and treated our first subject 
in february  after reviewing the results of our initial subject treatment with the fda  we received clearance from the fda to simultaneously enroll the remaining subjects in the first dose level  which we expect will result in an acceleration of the trial 
despite this recent event  we continue to expect that the regulatory review process for gene therapy programs will be uncertain  lengthy  and complex  and that the development of our gene delivery products may require longer clinical development timelines and greater investments to complete than previously anticipated 
we are a development stage company and have primarily supported the financial needs of our research and development activities since our inception through public offerings and private placements of our equity securities 
we have not received any revenue from the sale of our products in development  and we do not anticipate generating revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future 
as a result  we expect that we will need to obtain additional funding to support the anticipated future needs of our research and development activities and potential acquisition or in licensing of new development products 
we expect our source of revenue  if any  for the next several years to consist of payments under collaborative arrangements with third parties  government grants  and license fees 
we have incurred losses since our inception and expect to incur losses over the next several years due to our lack of any substantial source of revenue and the continuation of our ongoing and planned research and development efforts  including preclinical studies and clinical trials 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully acquire  develop  commercialize  manufacture  or market our product candidates or ever achieve or sustain product revenues or profitability 
at december  we had an accumulated deficit of million and cash  cash equivalents  available for sale securities  and restricted investments of approximately million 
we believe that our capital resources at december  will be adequate to fund our current operating needs over the next three to four years 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to revenue recognition  valuation of investments in financial instruments  impairment of property and equipment  and allocation of research and development expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described under note in the notes to our financial statements  we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue associated with up front license  technology access and research and development funding payments under collaborative agreements ratably over the relevant periods specified in the agreements  generally the development phase 
this development phase can be defined as a specified period of time  however  in certain cases  the collaborative agreement specifies a development phase that culminates with milestone objectives but does not have a fixed date and requires us to estimate the time period over which to recognize this revenue 
our estimated time periods are based on management s estimate of the time required to achieve a particular development milestone considering the projected level of effort and current stage of development 
if our estimate of the development phase time period changes  the amount of revenue we recognize related to up front payments for a given period will accelerate or decrease accordingly 
for example  in march  we received a million payment from bayer under the terms of a collaboration agreement for coagulin b  for hemophilia administered to the liver 
the revenue associated with the payment was being recognized ratably over the development phase  which was initially estimated to be five years 
in may  we suspended subject enrollment in the phase i clinical trial for this product and  as a result  ended the development phase for this product and recognized as revenue million  constituting the portion of the million payment not previously recognized as revenue  during the quarter ended june  we recognize non refundable product license fees  including fees associated with research license agreements  for which we have no further performance obligations  and no continuing involvement requirements  on the earlier of the dates on when the payments are received or when collection is assured 
valuation of investments in financial instruments we carry investments in financial instruments at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity 
our investment portfolio does not include equity securities or derivative financial instruments that could subject us to material market risk  however  we do invest in corporate obligations that subject us to varying levels of credit risk 
management assesses whether declines in the fair value of investment securities are other than temporary 
if a decline in fair value of a financial instrument is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value and the amount of the write down is included in earnings 
in determining whether a decline is other than temporary  management considers the length of time and the extent to which the market value of the security has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and our intention and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value  which could be until maturity 
the determination of whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary requires significant judgment  and could have a material impact on our balance sheet and results of operations 
we have not had any write downs for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our financial instruments since our inception 
impairment of property and equipment we have invested significant amounts on construction for improvements to our research and development facilities  with the largest portion of our spending made to modify manufacturing facilities that are intended to comply with requirements of government mandated manufacturing rules for pharmaceutical production 
management assesses whether there has been any impairment in the value of these facilities 
if the value of our construction for improvements is judged to be impaired  the cost basis of the property and equipment is written down to fair value and the amount of the write down is included in our net loss 
in determining whether the value of our property and equipment is impaired  management considers failure of manufacturing facilities and equipment to comply with government mandated policies and procedures  failure of the products for which the manufacturing facilities have been constructed to receive regulatory approval  and the extent that facilities could be idled due to the adoption of operating efficiencies for an other than temporary period  resulting in excess capacity 
the determination of whether the value of our property and equipment is impaired requires significant judgment  and could have a material impact on our balance sheet and results of operations 
we have not had any write downs for impairment in the value of our construction for improvements since our inception 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses include certain expenses that are incurred over multiple reporting periods  such as fees for contractors and consultants  fees to collaborators for preclinical research studies  subject treatment costs related to clinical trials and related clinical manufacturing costs  and license fees for use of third party intellectual property rights 
management assesses how much of these multi period costs should be charged to research and development expense in each reporting period 
in determining whether clinical trial activities and preclinical animal studies performed by third parties should be recognized in a specific reporting period  management considers estimates of the percentage of work completed over the life of the individual study in accordance with agreements established with the third party service providers  and estimates of the percentage of work completed over the life of the individual study in accordance with discussions with internal clinical and preclinical personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of trials or services and the agreed upon fee to be paid for such services 
the determination of the percentage of work completed that determines the amount of research and development expense that should be recognized in a given period requires significant judgment  and could have a material impact on our balance sheet and results of operations 
these estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the service providers as determined by subject enrollment levels  preclinical animal study schedules  and related activities 
we monitor service provider activities to the extent possible  however  if we underestimated activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time  we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods 
results of operations revenue in thousands  except percentages revenue percentage increase decrease over prior period in and  revenue primarily consisted of the recognition of million and  respectively  of deferred revenue from the million payment received from bayer in in connection with our collaboration on the development of coagulin b for the treatment of hemophilia b to the liver 
the payment was being recognized ratably over the estimated development period of the hemophilia b product candidate  which was estimated at five years from the date of the payment  or  per quarter since june in may  we suspended subject enrollment in the trial  which resulted in the termination of the development period of the liver targeted product candidate associated with the bayer payment 
we recognized the remaining million of deferred revenue in the second quarter of research license fees totaled   and  respectively  during   and research license agreements allow the licensee to make or use products using our patented aav technologies for research purposes only  and do not allow for the use of our technologies in products for commercial sale 
these licenses usually include initiation fees and annual maintenance fees based on the initial date of the agreement  and therefore do not occur ratably throughout the year 
royalty revenue totaled   and  respectively  in   and  all of which was attributed to a single royalty license that was entered into in july  which allows for the development  manufacture  use and commercial sale of products using our patented aav technologies 
as a result of the recognition of the remaining amount of the bayer payment in the second quarter of  and the termination of the collaboration agreement with bayer in december  we expect that our revenues for the foreseeable future will consist solely of research license fees and royalty revenue  which we expect to be immaterial 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses can be divided into two primary functions  costs to support research and preclinical development and costs to support preparation for and implementation of human clinical trials 
research and preclinical development costs include activities associated with general research and exploration  animal studies  production of vector for use by external collaborators in general research and exploration  development of processes to translate research achievements into commercial scale capabilities  and in house and independent third party validation testing of potential acquisition or in license drug candidates 
clinical development costs include activities associated with preparing for regulatory approvals  maintaining regulated and controlled processes  manufacturing vector for use in human clinical trials  and supporting subject enrollment and subject administration within clinical trials 
during the second half of  we took strategic steps to focus the work of our research and development organizations on the clinical development of our lead gene delivery product programs 
this included a reduction in staff and the implementation of other operational efficiencies without limiting our production capabilities 
our research and development staff count grew from approximately at december  to a peak of approximately in september the impact of the workforce reduction in october reduced that staff level to at december  at december   our staff count dedicated to research and development activities had declined to approximately in july  consistent with the decision to suspend subject enrollment in the phase i clinical trial for hemophilia b  and the refocus of our resources toward our programs for serious neurological disorders  we further reduced our total staff by approximately  which reduced the number of employees dedicated to research and development activities to approximately at december  during and  our research and preclinical development expenses included activities for our development programs for hemophilia  parkinson s disease  neuropathic pain  and other neurological targets  as well as validation activities associated with potential acquisition or in license of non gene therapy drug products 
during and  our clinical development expenses included activities to support our gene therapy development programs for coagulin b for hemophilia and av for parkinson s disease 
during  our research and preclinical development expenses were focused on our development programs for hemophilia and parkinson s disease  and other cardiac and neurological targets  and our clinical development expenses were focused on our development programs for coagulin b and av the costs associated with these two primary functions of our research and development activities approximate the following in thousands year ended december  percentage decrease over year ended december  percentage decrease over research and preclinical development clinical development total research and development expenses because a significant percentage of our research and development resources are dedicated to activities that focus on fundamental platform technologies that may be used in many different product applications  including production and administration techniques  the majority of our costs are not directly attributed to individual development programs 
decisions regarding our project management and resource allocation are primarily based on interpretations of scientific data  rather than cost allocations 
our estimates of costs between research and preclinical development and clinical development are primarily based on staffing roles within our research and development departments 
as such  costs allocated to specific projects may not necessarily reflect the actual costs of those efforts and  therefore  we do not generally evaluate actual costs incurred information on a project by project basis 
in addition  we are unable to estimate the future costs to completion for any specific projects 
we have reclassified approximately  as clinical development expenses that were reported as research and preclinical development expenses for in our annual report on form k for the period ended december   files with the sec on march  this reclassification had no impact on our results of operations 
comparison of the years ended december  and the decrease of  in our research and preclinical development expenses for  compared to  was primarily due to changes in costs for the following lower materials expenses of  primarily reflecting a decrease in our consumption of materials to produce aav vectors and support our other on going research activities as a result of the transfer of our parkinson s program into a clinical development phase  our refocusing of our efforts on fewer gene therapy projects  and the general impact of our lower staff levels due to the staff reduction that occurred in july  lower expenditures for services from third party collaborators associated with our preclinical animal studies of  primarily related to the completion of a significant portion of our work with parkinson s disease in as it transitioned into a clinical development phase in  lower use tax of  related to payments in for materials that had not been properly assessed in previous years  lower recruiting and relocation expenses of  reflecting the decline in hiring and the use of relocation payment incentives in compared to partially offset by  higher severance expenses of  representing  paid to employees affected by the staff reduction in july  compared to  paid to an executive in  higher facilities related expenses of  related to the rise in costs under the new building lease that went into effect in june  and higher bonus expenses of  reflecting the accrual and payment of bonuses in  compared to the reversal of accrued bonuses of  without any payment during the decrease of million in our clinical development expenses for  compared to  was primarily due to changes in costs for the following lower license origination fees of  including  of non cash charges in connection with the issuance of warrants in  lower materials expenses of  reflecting lower levels of material consumed in for the production of clinical grade aav vectors due to the delayed needs of our development programs at the clinical development stage  lower personnel related expenses of  related to the staff reduction in july of approximately employees  partially offset by higher average salaries in  and lower facilities expenses of  due to the decrease in the allocation of space to clinical development activities in  partially offset by  higher expenditures for services from third party collaborators associated with treating and monitoring subjects in our clinical trials of  primarily related to regulatory costs associated with filing for fda approval and recruiting our first subject in our phase i clinical trial for parkinson s disease  and higher severance expenses of  representing  paid to employees affected by the staff reduction in july  compared to  paid to an executive in comparison of the years ended december  and the decrease of  in our research and preclinical development expenses for  compared to  was primarily due to changes in costs for the following lower materials expenses of million  primarily reflecting a decrease in our consumption of materials to produce our aav vectors and support our on going research activities related to our lower average staff level in when compared to the average staff level for most of  as well as the benefits of operating efficiencies we have implemented over the previous two years  lower personnel related expenses of  primarily reflecting the full year impact of our lower staff levels in after the workforce reduction that occurred in october  and lower consulting expenses of  reflecting decreased involvement by third party service providers to support our in house research  partially offset by  higher expenditures for services from third party collaborators associated with our preclinical animal studies of  primarily related to our work with parkinson s disease  higher depreciation expenses of  reflecting the full year impact of newly constructed facilities that were placed in service in the second half of for general and animal research  and higher other facilities related expenses of  related to the rise in costs under the new building lease that went into effect in and generally higher maintenance costs 
the decrease of million in our clinical development expenses for  compared to  was primarily due to changes in costs for the following lower personnel related expenses of million  primarily reflecting the impact of our lower average staff level in after the workforce reduction in october  lower materials expenses of  reflecting lower levels of materials consumed in for the production of clinical grade aav vectors due to the delayed needs of our coagulin b clinical trial  as well as the general benefits from manufacturing efficiencies adopted over the previous two years for the production of our aav vectors  lower expenditures to third party collaborators associated with treating and monitoring subjects in our clinical trial of  reflecting the delay in treating coagulin b subjects in  and lower consulting and validation services expenses of  primarily in connection with regulatory and quality assurance process improvements and validation of new cgmp facilities that were completed in  partially offset by  higher license origination fees of  including  of non cash charges in connection with the issuance of warrants in  higher depreciation expenses of  reflecting the full year impact of newly constructed facilities that were placed in service in the second half of for cgmp manufacturing  and higher other facilities related expenses of  related to the rise in costs under the new building lease that went into effect in and generally higher maintenance costs 
total research and development expenses for were within management s expectations  taking into account the impact of the july staff reduction  the suspension of subject enrollment in the phase i clinical trial for coagulin b in may  and the initiation of our clinical trial for parkinson s disease  despite the delay  in december we believe delays in regulatory approvals and subject scheduling and coordination will continue to be factors that contribute to slower progress in our future clinical trials  particularly for gene therapy related programs 
if we are successful in our efforts to acquire or in license drug candidates in later stage development  our total research and development spending will be likely to rise in to meet the development needs of such products 
however  if we are not successful in our efforts  we would expect to see total research and development spending decline in from our level in connection with the expected lower average staff levels 
general and administrative expenses in thousands  except percentages general and administrative expenses percentage increase decrease over prior period comparison of the years ended december  and the increase of  in our general and administrative expenses in  compared to  was primarily due to changes in costs for the following higher severance expenses of million  approximately  of which was accrued in connection with the resignation of our former ceo in march and approximately  paid to employees affected by the staff reduction in july  higher bonus expenses of  reflecting the accrual and payment of bonuses in compared to the reversal of  of accrued bonuses and no payments in  and higher facilities related expenses of  related to the rise in costs under the new building lease that went into effect in  partially offset by  lower personnel related expenses of  reflecting the impact of a general decline in our average general and administrative staff level during the last year  including the resignation of our former ceo in march  lower travel and other expenses of  lower recruiting expenses of  reflecting the decline in hiring in  compared to  and lower legal fees of  primarily related to patent related litigation costs and higher corporate legal support in compared to comparison of the years ended december  and the decrease of  in our general and administrative expenses between and was primarily related to lower personnel related costs of approximately  reflecting lower staff levels as a result of the october workforce reduction  lower depreciation and facilities related expenses related to the reduction in allocation of space to our non research and development activities of approximately  in  and lower litigation related legal fees of approximately  as a result of the settlement of our lawsuit with research corporation technologies  inc these decreases were partially offset by higher patent related legal fees of approximately  and higher expenses for other professional services and information services of approximately  we expect our general and administrative expenses for to remain steady or decrease slightly from our levels  primarily due to lower average staff level 
however  if we are successful in our efforts to acquire or in license later stage clinical development drug candidates  our expected general and administrative spending levels may increase to connection with the changing needs of the company 
interest income in thousands  except percentages interest income percentage decrease over prior period almost all of our interest income is generated from our investments in high grade marketable securities of government and corporate debt 
the declines in interest income between and and between and were primarily due to the decrease in our outstanding interest bearing cash and securities balances  due to the use of such resources to fund our on going operations  and to the decline in the average yield earned on our portfolio of investments 
adoption of recently issued accounting standards in march  the fasb approved emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the objective of this issue is to provide guidance for identifying other than temporarily impaired investments 
eitf no 
also provides new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb issued eitf no 
 which delayed the effective date of eitf no 
 with the exception of certain disclosure requirements 
we do not believe that the adoption of eitf no 
will have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  and amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
fas eliminates the exception under opinion for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets that do not have commercial substance  as defined by the statement 
fas is effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not believe the adoption of fas to have a material impact on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r  fas r  share based payment  which amends fas and will be effective for public companies for interim or annual periods beginning after june  the new standard will require us to expense employee stock options and other share based payments in our statements of operations 
the fasb believes the use of a binomial lattice model for option valuation is capable of more fully reflecting certain characteristics of employee share options compared to the black scholes options pricing model 
the new standard may be adopted in one of three ways the modified prospective transition method  a variation of the modified prospective transition method or the modified retrospective transition method 
we are currently evaluating how we will adopt the standard 
we do not expect the adoption of fas r to have a material impact on our current compensation practices or our statements of cash flows 
however  we do expect that our adoption of fas r will significantly increase our reported operating expenses which would have a material impact on our results of operations and related financial position for all periods after adoption 
deferred income tax assets in accordance with fas  accounting for income taxes  which is described in the notes to our financial statements  we have calculated a deferred tax asset based on the potential future tax benefit we may be able to realize in future periods as a result of the significant tax losses experienced since our inception 
however  the value of such deferred tax asset must be calculated using the tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which such income occurs 
since we have no history of earnings  and cannot reliably predict when we might create taxable income  if at all  we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our calculated deferred tax asset 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception in  cash expenditures have significantly exceeded our revenue 
we have funded our operations primarily through public offerings and private placements of our equity securities 
after our initial public offering in may  we raised million from private placements and public offerings of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock  and from the receipt of million in research support from bayer corporation in march after our initial public offering  we also received additional monies as a result of exercises of previously issued warrants and options to purchase our common stock  including an additional million during the three year period ended december  the timing of and amounts realized from the exercise of these warrants and options are determined by the decisions of the respective warrant and option holders  and are not controlled by us 
therefore  funds received from exercises of stock options and warrants in past periods should not be considered an indication of additional funds to be received in the future periods 
in addition  a significant percentage of options and warrants currently outstanding have exercise prices that exceed the current trading price of our common stock  and so unless the trading price of our common stock increases significantly  those options and warrants may never be exercised in addition to funding our operations through sales of our common stock  we have attempted to contain costs and reduce cash flow requirements by renting scientific equipment and facilities  contracting with third parties to conduct research and development and using consultants  where appropriate 
we expect to incur additional future expenses  resulting in significant additional cash expenditures  as we continue our research and development activities  including our efforts to acquire or in license later stage clinical development drug candidates  and undertake additional preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates 
we also expect to incur substantial additional expenses relating to the filing  prosecution  maintenance  defense and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property claims 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents  available for sale securities  and restricted investments  of approximately million  compared to approximately million at december  and million at december  at december   and  million  million  and million  respectively  was pledged to secure certain long term liabilities 
at december    and  these long term liabilities included million for our line of credit  and million for equipment operating leases 
at december  and  these long term liabilities also included approximately  for letters of credit which serve as security deposits on our building lease 
our restricted investments are reported as a long term asset and would not be considered a current source of additional liquidity 
for the years ended december    and  respectively  net cash used in operating activities was million  million  and million 
the decrease is primarily due to the reduction in our net loss from million in to million in and million in the cash used in operating activities was primarily used to support our internal research and development activities  as well as preclinical studies and clinical trials performed by third parties 
the level of cash used for operating activities during was slightly lower than management s expectations at the beginning of the year due to the general delays in the progress of our clinical trials 
in  net cash used in operating activities included the receipt of a million payment from bayer corporation in march  which was recorded as deferred revenue 
for the year ended december   million and  was provided by investing and financing activities  respectively 
the cash provided by investing activities consisted primarily of sales and maturities  net of purchases  of available for sale securities  offset to a small degree by purchases of property and equipment of  the cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants during the period 
for the year ended december   million and  was provided by investing and financing activities  respectively 
the cash provided by investing activities consisted primarily of sales and maturities  net of purchases  of available for sale securities  offset to a small degree by purchases of property and equipment of  and increases in restricted investments of  the cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants during the period 
for the year ended december   million and  was provided by investing and financing activities  respectively 
the cash provided by investing activities consisted primarily of sales and maturities  net of purchases  of available for sale securities  offset to a degree by purchases of property and equipment of million and increases in restricted investments of million 
the cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants during the period 
in july  we eliminated staff positions  thereby reducing our staff level to approximately employees in order to reduce our ongoing operating expenses and extend the life of our current financial resources 
the eliminated positions were primarily in research and development areas and resulted in approximately  in severance payments and other termination related benefits  of which approximately  was included in general and administrative expenses and  was included in research and development expenses 
all severance related costs were paid in we believe that the future annual savings in personnel costs  including salaries  benefits  and temporary staffing  related to the impact of this staff reduction will approximate million 
the following are contractual commitments at december  associated with debt obligations  lease obligations  and contractual commitments to fund third party research in thousands payments due by period contractual commitment total less than year years years after years revolving line of credit operating leases research funding for third parties total in june  we amended the terms of our million revolving line of credit which had been put in place with wells fargo bank in june  to provide support for construction related activities  and subsequently amended in june under the terms of the current amendment  the expiration date of the borrowing was extended from june  to june   thereby deferring the timetable to repay principal borrowed for two years 
the debt instrument bears interest at a floating rate based on the london inter bank offered rate  which is reset in three month increments after the date of each drawdown  until such expiration 
as of december  and  the average annual rate of interest charged on the borrowing was approximately and  respectively 
also under the terms of this agreement  we pledged a portion of our portfolio of available for sale securities as collateral and have identified the amount of the pledged securities as restricted investments on our balance sheets 
the amount of the pledged securities is equal to the amount of utilized borrowing capacity on the line of credit 
at december   we had borrowed million from the line of credit and had reserved the remaining million in borrowing capacity to secure a letter of credit in connection with the property lease entered into in november as a result  at december   we have no more borrowing capacity under this facility 
our current office and facility includes approximately  square feet of space 
of this  approximately  square feet of space is leased through may and approximately  square feet of space is leased through november payments scheduled under these lease commitments are included in the table above under operating leases 
we enter into commitments to fund collaborative research and clinical work performed by third parties 
while these contracts are cancelable by either party  we expect the research studies and clinical work to be completed as defined in the terms of the agreements  and all amounts paid when due 
payments scheduled to be made under these contracts are included in the table above under research funding for third parties 
we have announced that we are actively seeking to broaden our portfolio of drug development candidates through an acquisition or in licensing program  and that this effort has identified several validated compounds that are being investigated  some of which have experience in human clinical trials 
if we are successful in in licensing or otherwise acquiring compounds  and we pay for such programs in cash  our capital resources will be reduced 
further  any in license of compounds in greater amounts than we currently project could cause our expenses to increase beyond our current expectations 
we believe we will continue to require substantial additional funding in order to complete the research and development activities currently contemplated and to commercialize our proposed products 
we believe that with the implementation of the staff reduction in july and our projected lower levels of spending to support on going operations  our capital resources at december  will be adequate to fund our current operating needs for approximately three to four years 
however  this forward looking statement is based upon our current plans and assumptions regarding our future operating and capital requirements  which may change 
our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors  including how successful  if at all  we are at acquiring or in licensing compounds  and the nature of the consideration we pay for in licensing compounds  continued scientific progress in research and development programs  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patents claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological developments  the cost of manufacturing scale up  the costs of commercialization activities  and other factors which may not be within our control 
we intend to continue to seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financing  when market conditions allow  or through additional collaborative arrangements with corporate partners 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  there may be further dilution to existing stockholders 
we cannot assure our investors that we will be able to enter into such financing arrangements on acceptable terms or at all 
without such additional funding  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long term debt 
we do not hold derivative financial investments  derivative commodity investments or other financial investments or engage in foreign currency hedging or other transactions that expose us to other market risks 
none of our investments are held for trading purposes 
our investment objectives are focused on preservation of principal and liquidity 
by policy  we manage our exposure to market risks by limiting investments to high quality issuers and highly liquid instruments with effective maturities of less than three years  and an average aggregate portfolio duration of approximately one year 
our entire portfolio is classified as available for sale and  as of december   consisted of approximately fixed rate securities and variable rate securities 
this compares to approximately fixed rate securities and variable rate securities at december  we have evaluated the risk associated with our portfolios of investments in marketable securities and have deemed this market risk to be immaterial 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points  or  from their december  levels  we estimate that the fair value of our securities portfolio would decline by approximately  our estimated exposure at december  is lower than our estimated million exposure at december  due to the reduction in size of our overall portfolio 
the modeling technique used measures duration risk sensitivity to estimate the potential change in fair value arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market rates and quantifies the ending fair market value including principal and accrued interest 
our long term debt includes a million revolving line of credit due june   of which we have drawn down million in cash that will need to be repaid 
interest charged on the borrowing is based on libor and is reset in three month increments based on the date of each original drawdown 
as of december   the average annual rate of interest charged on the borrowing was approximately compared to as of december
