unless otherwise indicated  all references to the company will include any and all activities of its predecessor 
overview cap rock energy corporation is an electric distribution company operating in various noncontiguous areas in the state of texas 
the company provides service to over  meters in counties covering approximately  square miles in texas 
this includes  meters within two operating divisions in the midland stanton area of west texas   meters in the central texas area around brady  and over  meters in northeast texas in hunt  collin and fannin counties 
the company also provides management services to the farmersville municipal electric system which services nearly  meters in farmersville  texas 
the company purchases power from wholesale suppliers and distributes that power to its retail customers over transmission lines covering over miles and then over  miles of distribution lines 
the company s primary focus is on the distribution of electricity to its customers  and therefore has not and does not plan to engage in the generation of electricity 
in  the company purchased all electric power pursuant to wholesale electric power contracts with three suppliers 
generally  the wholesale electric power supply contracts are based on fixed charges for kwh usage  transportation and auxiliary services and a variable charge for fuel based on kwh usage 
the company s purchased power costs fluctuate primarily with the price of fuel used to generate that electricity  which is primarily natural gas and coal 
however  all costs associated with purchased power are passed through to the retail customer 
effective september   the company became subject to the oversight authority of the puct  and the rates and fees charged to customers by the company are now subject to puct approval 
in accordance with this change  the company filed its tariff for electric service with the puct 
the company was also required to submit a standard rate filing package to the puct in late february  in connection an inquiry instituted by the puct to determine the reasonableness of the company s electric rates 
this filing contained a request for a rate increase for some customer classes 
a hearing was held in october regarding the company s rate filing package and a final decision is expected in the second quarter of a hearing will be held in april  to determine if the tariffs filed by the company are the actual tariffs that were approved by the company s board of directors  which was the company s previous regulatory authority 
the company believes the issue is moot because any current tariff will be superseded by the tariff that is ultimately approved by the puct in the current rate case 
a total of  in third party costs were incurred to prepare the rate filing package  as well as the public hearing process 
the amount and period over which the company will be allowed to recover these costs will be determined by the puct 
at september   the company had a note payable to a bank for  which was cross collateralized by notes receivable from united fuel and energy corporation united fuel in the same amount 
in october  united fuel consummated financing with a lender that provided for funds to partially pay down the company s note payable to a bank  with united fuel taking the position as borrower on the company s note payable to a bank  thus extinguishing united fuel s note receivable to the company 
the company was a secondary guarantor for united fuel s note  and was required to record a guarantee obligation based on fair value 
when united fuel repaid the note to the bank in november  the company s obligation as guarantor was effectively released and it was able to eliminate the recorded  guarantor obligation 
in march  the company signed an agreement with a shareholder of united fuel to sell the company s shares of stock in united fuel at a sales price of  in exchange for a note receivable from that shareholder 
the terms of the agreement provide for repayment after united fuel has completed certain capitalization arrangements 
all conditions required pursuant to the agreement have been satisfied  and the company expects payment as scheduled in recognition of the gain of  has been deferred until principal payments have been received 
the financing arrangements with beal bank provided for an initial and an additional advance 
the company drew the initial advance in september a collateralized cash investment was used to repay the initial advance of  in november critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments and estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments and estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from other outside sources as appropriate 
different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  that could have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
management believes that the following financial estimates are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments 
further  it is believed that the items discussed below are properly recorded in the financial statements for all periods presented 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of the most critical financial estimates with the board of directors audit committee 
rate regulation 
the company s most critical accounting policy involves rate regulation 
the company is subject to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas statement no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
in certain circumstances  sfas no 
requires that certain costs and or obligations be deferred on the balance sheet until matching revenues are recognized  subject to regulatory approval 
it is the company s policy to assess the recoverability of costs recognized as regulatory assets in accordance with sfas no 
 based on each regulatory action and the criteria set forth in sfas no 
any disallowance of these deferred costs would be charged immediately against income upon that disallowance 
power cost recovery factor 
the power cost recovery factor is the difference between the cost of power purchased and the cost of power recovered from customers  divided by the number of kilowatt hours billed during the period 
power purchased includes transmission costs and wheeling charges 
this factor is estimated each month to recover actual power costs and is added as a surcharge to the base rate 
the factor is based on estimates of power cost increases or decreases due to changes in fuel cost  usage and other cost fluctuations 
the estimate is adjusted in the subsequent month as compared to actual activity 
the company currently defers the difference between actual purchased cost and billed cost as a regulatory asset or liability 
the regulatory asset or liability  as well as the deferral  are adjusted accordingly by either receipt from  or refund to  the customer of the net deferred amount 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company may enter into derivative transactions to manage the cost of natural gas as the fuel component of power cost 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the pricing under the company s various power contracts varies with fuel cost  which is generally determined by the cost of natural gas 
derivative transactions minimize the fluctuations in the company s customers power bills 
these instruments are measured at fair market value and recorded as an asset or liability with a corresponding regulatory asset or liability 
changes in the fair value are recognized in current earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
as of december  and  no derivative positions were held 
revenue recognition policy 
for all periods through december   the company and its predecessor  the cooperative  utilized the cycle billing method to recognize revenue  pursuant to the rate making policy as set by the board of directors 
the cycle billing method recognizes revenue on an as billed basis when the customer is billed and not on an accrual basis  which recognized revenue as the power is distributed to the customer 
by utilizing the as billed method  unbilled revenue was not recognized 
effective january   the company s board of directors changed the rate making policy to recognize unbilled revenue 
the company was then required to change accounting principles related to its revenue recognition method 
under the new rate making structure  the company recognizes revenue when power is distributed to the customer  rather than when the customer is billed 
stock based compensation 
effective january   the company adopted the fair value method of accounting for its employee stock incentive plan in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure 
tax liabilities and valuation of deferred tax assets 
the company is required to assess the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets generated from net operating losses  and capital losses incurred on the sale of assets 
this assessment takes into consideration tax planning strategies within our control  including assumptions regarding the availability and character of future taxable income 
at december  and  the company has recorded  and  of valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of the tax asset is mainly dependent on the availability of future taxable income 
the ultimate amount of deferred tax assets realized could be materially different from that recorded  as impacted by changes in federal income tax laws to enable us to realize the related tax assets 
at december  and  there were approximately  and  of net operating loss carryforwards that expire in through  and may be used to offset future taxable income 
the company recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets related to net operating losses 
this determination was based on the assessment that it is more likely than not that the company may not be able to realize these deferred assets during the carryforward period 
this assessment considered the forecast reversal of existing temporary differences and taxable income expected to be generated in the carryforward period 
impairment of long lived assets 
management reviews the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
unforeseen events and changes in conditions could indicate that these carrying values may not be recoverable and may therefore result in impairment charges 
an impairment loss is recognized only if the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds its future undiscounted cash flows  and if required  fair value of long lived asset is written down to its fair value 
the determination of future cash flows  and if required  fair value of long lived asset is by its nature a highly subjective judgment 
fair value is determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate  third party contracted bids or appraisals performed by a qualified party 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the long term estimated cash flows  including long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth 
changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the assessment of our long lived assets 
postretirement healthcare benefits 
the company provides certain postretirement healthcare benefits to employees and retirees 
determining the costs associated with such benefit is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including demographics age  sex  mortality rates  discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligations  and current and projected health care cost trend rates 
independent actuaries perform the required calculations  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods 
results of operations year ended december  thousands of dollars operating revenues electric revenues other total operating revenues the consumption and demand for electricity within the company s service areas is greatly impacted by weather conditions and temperatures 
the hot temperatures during the summer months  or the third quarter  require residential customers to use more electricity in cooling their homes 
rural customers who irrigate crops use more electricity in the summer months for the irrigation process  and if the spring season didn t bring much rain  these customers may irrigate sooner and longer 
portions of the company s service areas had been experiencing a severe long term drought  but these conditions are much less severe than in the past 
although electric revenues decreased only  between and  the aggregate components were an increase in power cost recovery of  increase in wholesale sales and kwh sales of  a decrease in of  as a result of the change in accounting principle 
the increase in power cost recovery is comprised of the increase of the pass through of fuel costs to customers of  and a decrease in the amount of revenue recognition related to a regulatory surcharge authorized by the board of directors of  it was intended to recover some of the expense incurred in connection with the company s response to opposing intervenors actions in the ccn case 
a total of  was billed to customers from june through february   was recognized as revenue in   was recognized as revenue in  and the remainder of  is shown as a regulatory liability on the balance sheet at december  electric revenues increased  for as compared to this rise is due to multiple factors an increase of  for recovery of power costs  an increase in revenue accruals of  due to the effect of the change in accounting principle in the company had been realizing deferred revenue of  equally over a month period from january to december this revenue was recognized equally in both the and periods  and was billed through the power cost recovery factor  and is not being reflected in any future periods 
this item related to purchased power that was expensed in prior years 
because of a change in the public utility regulatory act pura  as of september   the company s rates became subject to regulation and approval by the puct  not the company s board of directors 
in accordance with this change in the pura  the company filed its tariffs for electric service on september  the staff of the puct reviewed those tariffs and provided comments and proposed changes to bring the tariffs into compliance with puct rules and regulations 
because the tariffs  when adopted  were not subject to puct regulation  some of the provisions did not comply with puct rules and regulations since that was not a requirement when the tariffs were adopted 
now that the company is subject to puct regulation  the company made proposed amendments to its tariff as suggested by the puct staff 
the puct staff reviewed the proposed changes and recommended that the tariff be approved 
prior to the administrative law judge entering a ruling approving the tariff  with the proposed changes  several of the group of intervenors in the case were successful in obtaining a legislative request that the matter be referred to the state office of administrative hearings soah for a hearing on the merits 
as a result  the matter was referred to soah and a hearing is currently scheduled for april  the hearing will be limited to whether the tariffs filed by the company are the actual tariffs that were properly approved by the company s board of directors  which was the company s previous regulatory authority 
the company believes the issue is moot because any current tariff will be superseded by the tariff that is ultimately approved by the puct in the current rate case 
in october  the puct initiated an inquiry to determine the reasonableness of the company s rates and ordered the company to submit a rate filing package 
the company prepared and filed a rate filing package that contained a request for a rate increase for some customer classes 
the company initially requested a  overall annual after tax increase but due to adjustments made while preparing for the hearing on the merits in the case  that amount was adjusted downward to  hearings were held before the state office of administrative hearings from october   through october  during such hearings  the company presented testimony and evidence in support of its requested rate increase 
numerous intervening parties and the puct staff presented evidence and testimony in opposition to the rate increase and in support of a rate decrease 
the parties have filed briefs in support of their positions 
the company has agreed to extend the effective date for the requested rate increase until june  a hearing was held in december  to determine the amount of rate case costs that the puct will allow the company to recover from its customers  as well as the period of recovery 
the company believes all its rate case costs are reasonable and necessary and should be recoverable 
any amount not allowed for recovery will be expensed immediately 
as of december    of third party costs had been incurred in connection with the rate case  and are shown on the balance sheet as a regulatory asset 
these costs were deferred pending approval of recovery by the puct 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements 
on march   the administrative law judges alj s issued a proposal for decision pfd 
the pfd recommended a rate decrease for cap rock 
this amounts to an annual revenue decrease of approximately five million dollars 
several intervenors had sought rate decreases which were much larger than the recommendation of the alj s 
a final ruling  which can be appealed by cap rock or any of the intervenors  is expected by june the company feels that its rates and its requested rate increase are justified and that the evidence supports that 
the company will request that the puct reject the recommendation of the alj s and grant its requested rate increase 
the company has received recommendations from administrative law judges in the past which were not in its favor  only to prevail when the issues were considered by the puct 
the company believes its rates are reasonable and that the requested rate increase is appropriate based upon its cost of service and reasonable return on its rate base 
however  the company cannot determine what action the puct will take with respect to the pfd 
if the company s request for a rate increase is approved by the puct  the company may suffer a decline in its customer base 
because the outcome of the rate request or rate order is unknown  the company is unable to predict the effect of such order 
year ended december  thousands of dollars operating expenses purchased power operations and maintenance general and administrative stock compensation depreciation and amortization property taxes other total operating expenses purchased power expense normally moves in relation to electric demand and consumption 
contract terms with wholesale power suppliers provide for pricing based upon the price of fuel  demand and usage 
all costs of power are passed through to the company s retail customers 
purchased power increased  from to the net changes related to increase in fuel cost related to the regulatory liability due to overcollection of power cost recovery of  increase in power costs of  decrease of  in because of the conclusion in of the rate making treatment of the capital lease payments associated with the transmission system 
purchased power only increased by  from to the net change is attributable to an increase in power costs of  which includes  of power cost lag because of the change to the accrual method of accounting  a conclusion in september to the rate making treatment of the capital lease payments which were associated with the transmission system 
this caused a decrease of  the cost of natural gas has risen from to  which increased the cost of purchased power and is passed directly through to customers 
rate making treatment required the company to classify the amortization of property and equipment under the capital lease  as well as the associated interest expense  as purchased power 
because the lease was extinguished in september  the treatment is no longer applicable  and the remaining net book value of the transmission system is being depreciated over its remaining life  and that expense is reflected in depreciation and amortization expense 
factors affecting operations and maintenance expense are certain weather conditions such as high winds  ice storms and lightning which cause damage to electric lines and interrupt service 
operations and maintenance increased  and  respectively  between and  and and the majority of the change is related to an increased need in maintenance for the distribution and transmission systems which resulted in current expense  as opposed to engaging in construction activities that would have resulted in capitalized costs 
general and administrative expenses increased by  from to  because of the following increased costs in of  related to it support and outsourced it functions  increased expenditures of  associated with public relations  decreased overhead allocation from to to utility plant and operations and maintenance of  resulted in higher costs remaining in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased by  between and  because of decreases in legal and professional fees  the majority of which were associated with the puct proceedings concerning the application to transfer the cooperative s certified territory to the company  as well as decreases in public reporting costs 
the company expects regular general and administrative expenses to increase in the future because compliance with puct rules and regulations  as well as the sarbanes oxley act of  will require more resources and personnel 
in december  the shareholders approved the stock incentive plan which authorized a total of  shares under that plan 
see equity compensation plans under item in april  each employee was granted a noncash stock award  with vesting over years 
officers  directors and certain retired directors were also granted noncash stock awards in july  with vesting periods ranging from to years 
both awards are being amortized to expense over periods of to years  with the expense reflecting the fair value of the award 
in december  an additional award of stock was granted to employees  officers and directors 
employee awards vest over two years  and officers and directors awards vested immediately 
the fair value of this award is being amortized to expense over the applicable vesting period 
expected noncash compensation expense by year for all awards is as follows    and  depreciation and amortization increased  from to because of the following factors conclusion in of the rate making treatment of the amortization of property and equipment associated with the transmission system capital lease caused an increase of  because the treatment is no longer applicable  amortization in of  relative to the capitalized costs of the it system 
depreciation and amortization increased  from the year ended as compared to for various reasons increased depreciation expense of  associated with changes in estimated useful lives of certain general plant assets  conclusion of the rate making treatment of the amortization of property and equipment associated with the transmission system capital lease caused an increase of  in connection with the original ten year capital lease associated with the transmission system  generally accepted accounting principles required the company to amortize the asset over a period consistent with the lease payments 
this period was much shorter than the estimated life of the asset  and the amortization was charged to purchased power 
because the capital lease was extinguished in september  and the rate making treatment is no longer applicable  the method of depreciation and life of the transmission system assets has changed to a straight line method with a year remaining life  and the expense is reflected in depreciation and amortization expense 
the company estimates the amount of such depreciation on the transmission system to be  per year 
in its efforts to be able to adapt to a changing regulatory environment  enhance efficiency and automate certain processes  management recognized the need for a more sophisticated and responsive it system and associated applications 
the company engaged an outside third party to assess the company s current and future it needs  assist in the selection process of software and related applications  implement the chosen products and processes and provide ongoing support 
the third party it company is also assisting the company in providing it internal control documentation and procedures related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of certain it costs associated with the change in the operating environment  the software applications and implementation process have been capitalized 
these costs aggregated  and  at december  and  and the company began a year amortization period beginning march  which was the end of the planned implementation 
in addition  the ongoing costs for maintenance and it support are based on the number of meters per respective month and  based on the number of meters as of december   will approximate  per year through the term of the contract  which is december all applications are anticipated to be operational by mid historically  property tax expense had remained relatively constant 
in  such expenses increased  because of current appraisal methodologies used in the ad valorem taxation of investor owned utilities in texas  as well as the company s revenue generating ability  as compared to its former status as a cooperative 
year ended december  thousands of dollars other income expense allocation of income from associated organizations interest expense  net of capitalized interest interest and other income impairment of lamar combination costs loss on sale of map stock equity earnings in map shareholders trust total other income expense interest expense decreased  between and because of the following amortization of all remaining fees and costs incurred with respect to the beal bank loan caused an increase of  the initial beal bank advance was drawn on in september and repaid in november  with a resulting net increase of  the cross collateralized note payable to a bank was extinguished in september causing a decrease of  between the periods  interest expense on mortgage debt reflects a decrease of  because of the declining balance on the debt 
in  there was no amortization of the fees and costs associated with the original transmission system capital lease because the lease was extinguished in september this caused a decrease of interest expense increased  between and because of the following increase of  because of the draw on the initial advance from beal bank in september at a rate of per annum  initial amortization of  of the legal fees and costs in incurred with respect to consummation of the beal bank loan  amortization of the fees and costs associated with the original transmission system capital lease were accelerated by  in order that these costs would be fully amortized by the end of the lease term  decrease in interest on mortgage debt of  because the company was able to lock in lower interest rates  coupled with a declining principal balance  decrease of  in interest associated with the cross collateralized note payable to a bank because of its declining balance and it was extinguished in september as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  in the company entered into an agreement to combine with lamar electric cooperative lamar 
lamar terminated the agreement in late although the company is seeking to recover the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the combination  generally accepted accounting principles required the impairment of those capitalized costs  which aggregated because the investment in map was sold in  the period will not reflect any transactions related to map 
when the company and the shareholders trust entered into a voting agreement in december  the company recorded a long term liability based on fair value of  and a corresponding expense 
this was for consideration whereby the shares held by the trust will be voted by the trustees as directed by the company for as long as the shares are held in the trust

this valuation allowance decreased  from to in part because of a change in temporary differences and the resulting net deferred taxes  and the changes in net operating losses between the two years 
in early  the irs notified the company that it intended to examine the federal income tax return of the cooperative for the year the company and the irs are in the final stages of that process  and management believes there will be no impact on the company s financial position or results of operations

the company should receive the million federal income tax receivable during through  one of the company s primary sources of capital and liquidity had been borrowings from the company s primary lender  national rural utilities cooperative finance corporation cfc 
these borrowings are collateralized by substantially all of the company s utility distribution assets 
the existing long term debt consists of a series of loans from cfc that impose various restrictive covenants  including the prohibition of additional secured indebtedness  or the guaranty of such  and requires the maintenance of a debt service coverage ratio as defined in the cfc loan agreements 
in addition  the company may not make any cash distribution or any general cancellation or abatement of charges for electric energy or services to its customers if the ratio of equity to total assets is less than a stated percentage 
at december   the company was in compliance with its cfc loan agreements and the applicable covenants

the financing arrangement provided for a commitment fee  which totaled  for the initial advance 
additional amounts paid to beal bank were reimbursement of expenses  attorney fees  appraisals and consulting  which at december   aggregated  prepayment of the initial advance was not allowed unless the additional advance was funded before the september   original due date 
two amendments to the financing agreement extended the due date of the initial advance  and the collateralized securities account was then used to repay the initial advance in november in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december   the initial advance of  is shown in current liabilities because it was not certain that the company would draw on the additional advance from beal bank 
stock awards were made to employees  officers and directors in both and noncash compensation expense of  and  was recorded for and  because the fair value of the award is being amortized over each of the applicable vesting periods
