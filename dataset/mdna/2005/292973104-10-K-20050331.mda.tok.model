critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns  inventory valuations  impairments of tangible and intangible assets  and other special charges and taxes
