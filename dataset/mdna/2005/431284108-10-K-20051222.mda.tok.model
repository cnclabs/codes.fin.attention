table of contents overview we are a fully integrated  self administered and self managed equity reit that provides leasing  management  development  construction and other customer related services for our properties and for third parties 
as of december   we owned or had an interest in in service office  industrial and retail properties  encompassing approximately million square feet and apartment units 
as of that date  we also owned  acres of development land  which is suitable to develop approximately million rentable square feet of office  industrial and retail space 
we are based in raleigh  north carolina  and our properties and development land are located in florida  georgia  iowa  kansas  maryland  missouri  north carolina  south carolina  tennessee and virginia 
as more fully described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  the company has restated its results for the years ended december  and and for the first three quarters of the restatement resulted from adjustments primarily related to the accounting for lease incentives  depreciation and amortization expense  straight line ground lease expense on one ground lease  gain recognition on a land condemnation  accounting for an embedded derivative  land cost allocations  the write off of undepreciated tenant improvements and commissions  capitalization of interest costs and internal leasing  construction and development costs on development properties  and purchase accounting for acquisitions completed in to results of operations during  approximately of our rental and other revenue was derived from our office properties 
as a result  while we own and operate a limited number of industrial and retail properties  our operating results depend heavily on successfully leasing our office properties 
furthermore  since most of our office properties are located in florida  georgia and north carolina  economic growth in those states is and will continue to be an important determinative factor in predicting our future operating results 
the key components affecting our revenue stream are average occupancy and rental rates 
average occupancy generally increases during times of improving economic growth  as our ability to lease space outpaces vacancies that occur upon the expirations of existing leases  while average occupancy generally declines during times of slower economic growth  when new vacancies tend to outpace our ability to lease space 
asset acquisitions and dispositions also impact our rental revenues and could impact our average occupancy  depending upon the occupancy percentage of the properties that are acquired or sold 
a further indicator of the predictability of future revenues is the expected lease expirations of our portfolio 
as of september   leases representing of our rentable square feet with respect to our wholly owned properties were expiring on or before december   representing approximately of our annualized revenue 
as a result  in addition to seeking to increase our average occupancy by leasing current vacant space  we also must concentrate our leasing efforts on renewing leases on expiring space 
for more information regarding our lease expirations  see properties lease expirations 
whether or not our rental revenue tracks average occupancy proportionally depends upon whether rents under new leases signed are higher or lower than the rents under the previous leases 
during  the average rental rate per square foot on new leases signed in our wholly owned properties was lower than the rent under the previous leases based on straight line rental rates 
at december   the occupancy rate for our wholly owned properties was 
as of september   the occupancy rate for our wholly owned properties increased to 
our expenses primarily consist of rental property expenses  depreciation and amortization  general and administrative expenses and interest expense 
rental property expenses are expenses associated with our ownership and operation of rental properties and include variable expenses  such as common area maintenance and utilities  and fixed expenses  such as property taxes and insurance 
some of these variable expenses may be lower when our average occupancy declines  while the fixed expenses remain constant regardless of average occupancy 
depreciation and amortization is a non cash expense associated with the ownership of real property and generally remains relatively consistent each year  unless we buy or sell assets  since we depreciate our properties on a straight line basis over a fixed life 
general and administrative expenses  net of amounts capitalized  consist primarily of management and employee salaries and other personnel costs  corporate overhead and long term incentive compensation 
interest expense depends upon the amount of our borrowings  the weighted average interest rates on our debt and the amount of interest capitalized on development projects 

table of contents we also record income from our investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
we record in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates our proportionate share of the unconsolidated joint ventures net income or loss 
during  income earned from these unconsolidated joint ventures aggregated million  which  net of minority interest  represented approximately of our total net income 
additionally  sfas no 
requires us to record net income received from properties sold or held for sale that qualify as discontinued operations under sfas no 
separately as income from discontinued operations 
as a result  we separately record revenues and expenses from these qualifying properties 
during  income  including gains and losses from the sale of properties  from discontinued operations  net of minority interest  accounted for approximately of our total net income 
liquidity and capital resources we incur capital expenditures to lease space to our customers and to maintain the quality of our properties to successfully compete against other properties 
tenant improvements are the costs required to customize the space for the specific needs of the customer 
lease commissions are costs incurred to find the customer for the space 
lease incentives are costs paid to or on behalf of tenants to induce them to enter into leases and which do not relate to customizing the space for the tenant s specific needs 
building improvements are recurring capital costs not related to a customer to maintain the buildings 
as leases expire  we either attempt to relet the space to an existing customer or attract a new customer to occupy the space 
generally  customer renewals require lower leasing capital expenditures than reletting to new customers 
however  market conditions such as supply of available space on the market  as well as demand for space  drive not only customer rental rates but also tenant improvement costs 
leasing capital expenditures are amortized over the term of the lease and building improvements are depreciated over the appropriate useful life of the assets acquired 
both are included in depreciation and amortization in results of operations 
because we are a reit  we are required under the federal tax laws to distribute at least of our reit taxable income  excluding capital gains  to our stockholders 
we generally use rents received from customers to fund our operating expenses  recurring capital expenditures and stockholder dividends 
to fund property acquisitions  development activity or building renovations  we incur debt from time to time 
as of december   we had million of secured debt outstanding and million of unsecured debt outstanding 
our debt generally consists of mortgage debt  unsecured debt securities and borrowings under our revolving loan 
as of november   we had approximately million of additional borrowing availability under our revolving loan and million in available cash and short term investments 
our revolving loan and the indenture governing our outstanding long term unsecured debt securities require us to satisfy various operating and financial covenants and performance ratios 
as a result  to ensure that we do not violate the provisions of these debt instruments  we may from time to time be limited in undertaking certain activities that may otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders  such as repurchasing capital stock  acquiring additional assets  increasing the total amount of our debt or increasing stockholder dividends 
we review our current and expected operating results  financial condition and planned strategic actions on an ongoing basis for the purpose of monitoring our continued compliance with these covenants and ratios 
any unwaived event of default could result in an acceleration of some or all of our debt  severely restrict our ability to incur additional debt to fund short and long term cash needs or result in higher interest expense 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding certain amendments and waivers relating to covenants under our revolving loan 
to generate additional capital to fund our growth and other strategic initiatives and to lessen the ownership risks typically associated with owning of a property  we may sell some of our properties or contribute them to joint ventures 
when we create a joint venture with a strategic partner  we usually contribute one or more properties that we own and or vacant land to a newly formed entity in which we retain an interest of or less 
in exchange for our equal or minority interest in the joint venture  we generally receive cash from the partner and retain some or all of the management income relating to the properties in the joint venture 
the joint venture itself will frequently borrow money on its own behalf to finance the acquisition of  and or leverage the return upon  the properties being acquired by the joint venture or to build or acquire additional buildings 
such borrowings are typically on a non recourse or limited recourse basis 
we generally are not liable for the debts of our joint ventures  except to the extent of our equity investment  unless we have directly guaranteed any of that debt 
in most cases  we and or our strategic partners are required to guarantee customary exceptions to non recourse liability in non recourse loans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on certain debt guarantees 

table of contents we have historically also sold additional common stock or preferred stock or issued common units to fund additional growth or to reduce our debt  but we have limited those efforts during the past five years because funds generated from our capital recycling program in recent years have provided sufficient funds to satisfy our liquidity needs 
in addition  we used funds from our capital recycling program to redeem preferred stock in and repurchase common stock in and we have also redeemed common units for cash in through management s analysis we believe that funds from operations ffo and ffo per share are beneficial to management and investors and are important indicators of the performance of any equity reit 
because ffo and ffo per share calculations exclude such factors as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and gains or losses from sales of real estate which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates  they facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other reits 
our management believes that historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
as a result  management believes that the use of ffo and ffo per share  together with the required gaap presentations  provide a more complete understanding of our performance relative to competitors and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating  financing and investing activities

table of contents results of operations comparison of to the following table sets forth information regarding our results of operations for the years ended december  and in millions year ended december  to change change restated rental and other revenues operating expenses rental property and other expenses depreciation and amortization impairment of assets held for use general and administrative total operating expenses interest expense contractual amortization of deferred financing costs financing obligations other income expense interest and other income settlement of bankruptcy claim loss on debt extinguishments gain on extinguishment of co venture obligation income before disposition of property  co venture expense  minority interest and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates gains on disposition of property  net co venture expense minority interest in the operating partnership equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates income from continuing operations discontinued operations income from discontinued operations  net of minority interest gain on sale of discontinued operations  net of minority interest net income dividends on preferred stock net income available for common stockholders rental and other revenues the decrease in rental and other revenues from continuing operations was primarily the result of the disposition of certain properties in and that were not included in discontinued operations and a decrease of approximately million in lease termination fees paid in from partly offsetting these decreases was an increase of approximately million in property management fees in from due to increased efforts in our third party management services and the contribution of certain properties to joint ventures in where we retained the management of the properties and received customary fees 
during the year ended december    second generation leases representing million square feet of office  industrial and retail space were executed with respect to our wholly owned properties 
the average rate per square foot on a gaap basis over the lease term for these leases was lower than the gaap rent under the previous lease 

table of contents as of the date of this filing  we are beginning to see a modest improvement in employment trends in a few of our markets and an improving economic climate in the southeast 
there has been modest positive absorption of office space in most of our markets during the past year 
also  we expect to deliver approximately  square feet of office and industrial fully leased new development properties by the end of accordingly  we expect our occupancy rate to increase at december  as compared to december  operating expenses rental and other operating expenses from continuing operations real estate taxes  utilities  insurance  repairs and maintenance and other property related expenses decreased in compared to  primarily as a result of the disposition of certain properties in and that were not included in discontinued operations 
this decrease was offset by general inflationary increases in certain fixed operating expenses  such as salaries  benefits  utility costs and real estate taxes 
our operating margin  defined as rental and other revenue less rental property and other expenses expressed as a percentage of rental and other revenues  decreased from in to in this decrease in margin was primarily caused by operating expenses increasing from inflationary pressure and other factors at a higher rate than rental revenues  which increased from rising occupancy in  offset by slightly lower average rental rates from rent roll downs 
we expect rental and other operating expenses to decrease slightly in due to the disposition of certain properties in and this decrease will be partly offset by inflationary increases in certain fixed operating expenses 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization from continuing operations is primarily related to the disposition of certain properties in and  which were not included in discontinued operations 
in addition  the contribution of certain properties to a joint venture in reduced depreciation and amortization by million 
we expect depreciation and amortization to decrease slightly in due to a further net reduction of our wholly owned portfolio 
in  an impairment loss of million was recognized in connection with an  rentable square foot office property that was classified as held for use 
this asset was later sold in the increase in general and administrative expenses in as compared to primarily relates to million recognized in in connection with a retirement package for our former chief executive officer  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  a million increase primarily relating to costs of personnel  consultants and our independent auditors in connection with a implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act  b evaluation of a strategic transaction in  and c the preparation and audit of the consolidated financial statements included herein  and the remaining million net increase primarily relates to higher long term incentive compensation costs  salary  fringe benefit and employee relocation costs 
in  general and administrative expenses are expected to decrease because of the non recurring nature of costs recorded in related to the former chief executive officer s retirement package  the evaluation of a strategic transaction in  and the abnormally high costs associated with the preparation and audit of the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year 
these decreases will be partly offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses related to inflationary increases in compensation  benefits and other costs expected in interest expense the decrease in contractual interest was primarily due to a decrease in average borrowings from  million in the year ended december  to  million in the year ended december  and a decrease in average interest rates on outstanding debt from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december   primarily due to debt refinancings completed in december and in june the decrease in interest expense on financing obligations was primarily a result of the purchase of our partner s interest in the orlando city group properties in mg hiw  llc in march which eliminated the requirement to record financing obligation interest expense with respect to the orlando city group properties from march  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on real estate sales that are accounted for as financing transactions 

table of contents total interest expense is expected to decline in primarily due to the june refinancing of the million of exercisable put option notes with borrowings on the revolving loan which currently has lower floating rate interest and the repayment through december  of million of mortgage loans payable  which had interest rates ranging from to  or a weighted average interest rate of 
in addition  an increase in capitalized interest due to additional development activity is expected to further decrease net interest expense 
these declines will be partly offset by expected increases in average interest rates on our variable rate debt in other income expense the increase in interest and other income is primarily related to the interest received in related to a note receivable acquired in connection with the disposition of certain properties in and higher interest rates earned on cash reserves 
in  we received net proceeds of million as a result of the settlement of the bankruptcy of worldcom see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on this settlement 
loss on debt extinguishments decreased million from million in to million in in  a million loss was recorded related to the retirement of the exercisable put option notes described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  a million loss was recorded related to the retirement of the million of mandatory par put remarketed securities mopprs described in note to the consolidated financial statements

in addition  we contributed approximately million square feet to highwoods markel associates  llc  a joint venture in which we have a interest 
net gains on the dispositions of properties that did not qualify for discontinued operations presentation aggregated million in  up from million in the largest gain in was million from the contribution of properties to hiw kc orlando 
net gains on the dispositions of properties that are classified as discontinued operations were million in  down from million in  these amounts are shown net of minority interest 
included in the net million for were million of impairment losses 
the decrease in co venture expense is due to our acquisition of our partner s interest in the non orlando city group properties in july and the resultant elimination of recording co venture expense as of that date 
co venture expense relates to the operations of the mg hiw  llc non orlando city group properties which were accounted for as a profit sharing arrangement until july minority interest in the continuing operations of the operating partnership  after preferred unit distributions  increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  due to a corresponding increase in the operating partnership s income from continuing operations 

table of contents the increase in equity in earnings from continuing operations of unconsolidated affiliates was primarily a result of a gain of million recognized in by a certain joint venture related to the disposition of land  of which our portion was million  an increase related to the formation of the hiw kc orlando  llc joint venture in  which contributed approximately million to equity in earnings from continuing operations of unconsolidated affiliates in  and an increase of million related to the addition of three office properties in to the highwoods markel associates  llc joint venture 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in average occupancy of buildings owned by certain joint ventures and a land sale by one of our joint ventures in  which resulted in a million decrease in equity in earnings from continuing operations of unconsolidated affiliates in as compared to discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 
 we classified net income of million and million  net of minority interest  as discontinued operations for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these amounts pertained to million square feet of property  apartment units and acres of revenue producing land sold during and and  square feet of property held for sale at december  these amounts include gain on the sale of these properties  net of impairment charges related to discontinued operations  of million and million  net of minority interest  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
net income we recorded net income in the year ended december  of million  which was a decrease from net income of million in the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the disposition of certain properties in and and increases in general and administrative costs as described above 
these amounts were offset by lower rental property expenses  depreciation and amortization expense  contractual interest expense  interest expense on financing obligations and co venture expense and an increase in gains on disposition of property as described above 
in  we expect net income to be higher as compared to due to slightly rising average occupancy and lower operating expenses  depreciation and amortization  general and administrative expenses and interest expense

co venture expense relates to the operations of the mg hiw  llc non orlando city group properties accounted for as a profit sharing arrangement  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the decrease of million in co venture expense in is largely due to our acquisition of our partner s interest in the non orlando city group properties in july and the resultant elimination of recording co venture expense as of that date 
minority interest in the continuing operations income of the operating partnership  after preferred unit distributions  decreased from million in to million in because of a corresponding reduction in the operating partnership s income from continuing operations

table of contents liquidity and capital resources statement of cash flows as required by gaap  we report and analyze our cash flows based on operating activities  investing activities and financing activities 
the following table sets forth the changes in the company s cash flows from to in thousands year ended december  change restated cash provided by operating activities cash provided by investing activities cash used in financing activities total cash flows in calculating cash flow from operating activities  gaap requires us to add depreciation and amortization  which are non cash expenses  back to net income 
as a result  we have historically generated a significant positive amount of cash from operating activities 
from period to period  cash flow from operations depends primarily upon changes in our net income  as discussed more fully above under results of operations  changes in receivables and payables and net additions or decreases in our overall portfolio  which affect the amount of depreciation and amortization expense 
cash provided by or used in investing activities generally relates to capitalized costs incurred for leasing and major building improvements and our acquisition  development  disposition and joint venture activity 
during periods of significant net acquisition and or development activity  our cash used in such investing activities will generally exceed cash provided by investing activities  which typically consist of cash received upon the sale of properties 
during and  since our disposition activity has outpaced our investment  development and acquisition activity  we recorded positive cash flow from investing activities in both years 
cash used in financing activities generally relates to stockholder dividends  distributions on our common units  incurrence and repayment of debt and sales  repurchases or redemptions of common stock  common units and preferred stock 
as discussed previously  we use a significant amount of our cash to fund stockholder dividends and common unit distributions 
whether or not we incur significant new debt during a period depends generally upon the net effect of our acquisition  disposition  development and joint venture activity 
we use our revolving loan for working capital purposes  which means that during any given period  in order to minimize interest expense associated with balances outstanding under the revolving loan  we will likely record significant repayments and borrowings under the revolving loan 
the increase of million in cash provided by operating activities was primarily a result of the timing of receipt of revenues and payment of expenses  partly offset by lower net income due to the disposition of certain properties under our capital recycling program 
the decrease of million in cash provided by investing activities was primarily a result of a decrease in proceeds from dispositions of real estate assets of million and our contribution to the highwoods kc glenridge  lp joint venture of million in slightly offsetting this decrease was an increase in distributions of capital from unconsolidated affiliates of million  mainly due to the financing of the highwoods kc glenridge  lp joint venture and a decrease in additions to real estate assets of million  for the year ended december  cash used in financing activities decreased million from to for the year ended december   net repayments on the unsecured revolving loan  mortgages and notes payable decreased by million  distributions paid on common stock and common units decreased by million and cash paid for the repurchase of common stock and common units decreased by million 
offsetting these effects was a payment on financing obligations of million  which is further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  and the effect of payments in of million on our co venture obligation  which is also discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we recorded payments on debt extinguishments of million related to the x pos refinancing in and million related to the mopprs refinancing in  which are both further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in  we have continued our capital recycling program of selectively disposing of non core land and other assets and using the net proceeds for reduction of outstanding debt and preferred stock balances  investments or other purposes 
during the nine months ended september   we have closed on the sale or contribution of million square feet of properties and land aggregating million in gross sales proceeds 
these transactions include most of the properties held for sale at december  during  we expect to have positive cash flows from operating activities 
the net cash flows from investing activities in are expected to be positive in based on our level of property dispositions  property acquisitions  development  and capitalized leasing and improvement costs 
positive cash flows from operating and investing activities in have been or are expected to be used to pay stockholder and unitholder distributions  scheduled debt maturities  principal amortization payments and paydown of debt and redemption of preferred stock 
capitalization the following table sets forth our capitalization as of december  and december  in thousands  except per share amounts december  december  restated mortgages and notes payable  at recorded book value financing obligations preferred stock  at redemption value common stock and common units outstanding per share stock price at period end market value of common equity total market capitalization with debt based on our total market capitalization of approximately billion at december  at the december  per share stock price of and assuming the redemption for shares of common stock of the million common units in the operating partnership not owned by the company  our mortgages and notes payable represented of our total market capitalization 
mortgages and notes payable at december  was comprised of million of secured indebtedness with a weighted average interest rate of and million of unsecured indebtedness with a weighted average interest rate of 
as of december   our outstanding mortgages and notes payable were secured by real estate assets with an aggregate undepreciated book value of approximately billion

the accretion continues until the liability equals the residual value of the land

refinancings in in  the operating partnership sold million of exercisable put option notes due june  the put option notes 
the put option notes bore an interest rate of from the date of issuance through june  after june   the interest rate to maturity on the put option notes was required to be plus the applicable spread determined as of june  in connection with the initial issuance of the put option notes  a counter party was granted an option to purchase the put option notes on june  at of the principal amount

in late june  we repaid million of borrowings under our revolving loan with proceeds from the sale of a interest in five office buildings in orlando  florida and from the sale of a building at highwoods preserve in tampa  florida 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further details of these asset sales 
refinancings in through december   we paid off million of outstanding loans  excluding any normal debt amortization  which included the following transactions 
in early april  we paid off million of callable secured mortgage debt  in mid july  we paid off another million of callable secured mortgage debt  and on august   we paid off million of secured variable rate mortgage debt that was due january  in september  we paid off our million term loan at maturity and three secured loans totaling million 
in november  we extended the maturity date on our million term loan to july  and lowered the interest rate 
on december   we paid off million of secured variable rate mortgage debt that was due february  in addition  on december   we exercised our option to pay down million on our aegon loan that matures in we also used some of the proceeds from our disposition activity to redeem  in august  all of our outstanding series d preferred shares and a portion of our outstanding series b preferred shares  aggregating million plus accrued dividends 
these reductions in outstanding debt and preferred stock balances were made primarily from proceeds from property dispositions that closed in operating and financial covenants and performance ratios the terms of the revolving loan  the million bank term loans and the indenture that governs our outstanding notes require us to comply with certain operating and financial covenants and performance ratios 
no circumstance currently exists that would result in an acceleration of any of this outstanding debt 
however  depending upon our future operating performance and property and financing transactions  we cannot assure you that no such circumstance would exist in the future 

table of contents if any of our lenders ever accelerated outstanding debt due to an event of default  we would not be able to borrow any further amounts under the revolving loan  which would adversely affect our ability to fund our operations 
if our debt cannot be paid  refinanced or extended at maturity or upon acceleration  in addition to our failure to repay our debt  we may not be able to make distributions to stockholders at expected levels or at all 
furthermore  if any refinancing is done at higher interest rates  the increased interest expense would adversely affect our cash flows and ability to make distributions to stockholders 
any such refinancing could also impose tighter financial ratios and other covenants that would restrict our ability to take actions that would otherwise be in our stockholders best interest  such as funding new development activity  making opportunistic acquisitions  repurchasing our securities or paying distributions 
our revolving loan and the bank term loans have identical ratio and financial covenants 
if we fail to satisfy any of the covenants after the expiration of any applicable cure periods  the lenders under our revolving loan and our bank term loans could accelerate amounts outstanding thereunder  which aggregated million at december  at december  and as of the date of this filing  we were in compliance with these covenants as amended or waived by the lenders as discussed below 
in march  we amended the revolving loan and our then outstanding two bank term loans 
the changes modified certain definitions used in all three loans to determine amounts that are used to compute financial covenants and also adjusted one of the financial ratio covenants 
in june  we amended the revolving loan and our then outstanding two bank term loans 
the changes excluded the million charge taken related to the refinancing of the put option notes from the calculations used to compute financial covenants 
in august  we further amended the revolving loan and our then outstanding two bank term loans 
the changes excluded the effects of accounting for three sales transactions as financing or profit sharing arrangements under sfas no 
from the calculations used to compute financial covenants  adjusted one financial covenant and temporarily adjusted a second financial covenant until the earlier of december  or the period when we could record income from the then anticipated settlement of a claim against worldcom  which occurred in september see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in october  we obtained a waiver from the lenders under the revolving loan and our then outstanding two bank term loans for certain covenant violations caused by the effects of the loss on debt extinguishment from the mopprs transaction in early in june  july  august and september  we obtained waivers from the lenders under the revolving loan and our then outstanding two bank loans related to timely reporting to the lenders of annual and quarterly financial statements and to covenant violations that could arise from future redemptions of preferred stock due to the reclassification of the preferred stock from equity to a liability during the period of time from the announcement of the redemption until the redemption is completed 
the aforementioned modifications did not change the economic terms of the loans 
in connection with these modifications  we incurred certain loan costs that are capitalized and amortized over the remaining term of the loans 
the revolving loan carries an interest rate based upon our senior unsecured credit ratings 
as a result  interest currently accrues on borrowings under the revolving loan at libor plus basis points 
the terms of the revolving loan require us to pay an annual base facility fee equal to 
of the aggregate amount of the revolving loan 
we currently have a credit rating of bbb assigned by standard poor s and fitch ratings and ba assigned by moody s investor service 
in january  moody s investor service confirmed our ba rating with a stable outlook 
if standard and poor s or fitch ratings were to lower our credit ratings without a corresponding increase by moody s  the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving loan would be automatically increased by basis points 
in november  we amended our million bank term loan to extend the maturity date to july  and reduce the spread over the libor interest rate from basis points to basis points 

table of contents as of the date of this filing  the operating partnership has not yet satisfied its requirement under the indenture governing our unsecured notes to file timely sec reports  but expects to do so as soon as practicable after the filing of our annual report 
under the indenture  the notes may be accelerated if the trustee or of the holders provide written notice of a default and such default remains uncured after days 
to date  neither the trustee nor any holder has sent us any such default notice 
the operating partnership is in compliance with all other covenants under the indenture and is current on all payments required thereunder 
current and future cash needs rental revenue  together with construction management  maintenance  leasing and management fees  are our principal source of funds to meet our short term liquidity requirements  which primarily consist of operating expenses  debt service  stockholder dividends  any guarantee obligations and recurring capital expenditures 
in addition  we could incur tenant improvements and lease commissions related to any releasing of vacant space 
we expect to fund our short term liquidity requirements through a combination of available working capital  cash flows from operations and the following the selective disposition of non core land and other assets  borrowings under our revolving loan which has up to million of availability as of november   the sale or contribution of some of our wholly owned properties  development projects and development land to strategic joint ventures to be formed with unrelated investors  which would have the net effect of generating additional capital through such sale or contributions  the issuance of secured debt at november   we had approximately billion of unencumbered real estate assets at undepreciated cost  and the issuance of new unsecured debt 
our long term liquidity needs generally include the funding of existing and future development activity 
as of september   we had approximately million of development activity in process  with million funded at september  and the remainder expected to be funded in the next months 
our long term liquidity needs also include the funding of selective asset acquisitions and the retirement of mortgage debt  amounts outstanding under the revolving loan and long term unsecured debt 
our goal is to maintain a conservative and flexible balance sheet 
accordingly  we expect to meet our long term liquidity needs through a combination of the issuance by the operating partnership of additional unsecured debt securities  the issuance of additional equity securities by the company and the operating partnership as well as the sources described above with respect to our short term liquidity 
we expect to use such sources to meet our long term liquidity requirements either through direct payments or repayments of borrowings under the unsecured revolving loan 
as mentioned above  we do not intend to reserve funds to retire existing secured or unsecured indebtedness upon maturity 
instead  we will seek to refinance such debt at maturity or retire such debt through the issuance of equity or debt securities 
we anticipate that our available cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operating activities  with cash available from borrowings and other sources  will be adequate to meet our capital and liquidity needs in both the short and long term 
however  if these sources of funds are insufficient or unavailable  our ability to pay dividends to stockholders and satisfy other cash payments may be adversely affected 
stockholder dividends to maintain our qualification as a reit  we must distribute to stockholders at least of our reit taxable income  excluding capital gains 
reit taxable income  the calculation of which is determined by the federal tax laws  does not necessarily equal net income under gaap 
we generally expect to use our cash flow from operating activities for dividends to stockholders and for payment of recurring capital expenditures 
future dividends will be 
table of contents made at the discretion of our board of directors 
the following factors will affect our cash flows and  accordingly  influence the decisions of the board of directors regarding dividends debt service requirements after taking into account debt covenants and the repayment and restructuring of certain indebtedness  scheduled increases in base rents of existing leases  changes in rents attributable to the renewal of existing leases or replacement leases  changes in occupancy rates at existing properties and execution of leases for newly acquired or developed properties  and operating expenses and capital replacement needs  including tenant improvements and leasing costs 
off balance sheet arrangements we have several off balance sheet joint venture and guarantee arrangements 
the joint ventures were formed with unrelated investors to generate additional capital to fund property acquisitions  repay outstanding debt or fund other strategic initiatives and to lessen the ownership risks typically associated with owning of a property 
when we create a joint venture with a strategic partner  we usually contribute one or more properties that we own to a newly formed entity in which we retain an interest of or less 
in exchange for an equal or minority interest in the joint venture  we generally receive cash from the partner and frequently retain the management income relating to the properties in the joint venture 
for financial reporting purposes  the sales of assets we sold to two of our joint ventures are accounted for as financing and or profit sharing arrangements 
as required by gaap  we use the equity method of accounting for our unconsolidated joint ventures in which we exercise significant influence but do not control the major operating and financial policies of the entity regarding encumbering the entities with debt and the acquisition or disposal of properties 
as a result  the assets and liabilities of these joint ventures are not included on our balance sheet and the results of operations of these joint ventures are not included on our income statement  other than as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
generally  we are not liable for the debts of our joint ventures  except to the extent of our equity investment  unless we have directly guaranteed any of that debt 
in most cases  we and or our strategic partners are required to guarantee customary limited exceptions to non recourse liability in non recourse loans 
as of december   our unconsolidated joint ventures had million of total assets and million of total liabilities as reflected in their financial statements 
at december   our weighted average equity interest based on the total assets of these unconsolidated joint ventures was 
during  these unconsolidated joint ventures earned million of total net income  of which our share  after appropriate purchase accounting and other adjustments  was million 
for a more detailed discussion of our unconsolidated joint venture activity  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   our unconsolidated joint ventures had million of outstanding mortgage debt 
all of this joint venture debt is non recourse to us except in the case of customary exceptions pertaining to such matters as misuse of funds  environmental conditions and material misrepresentations and those guarantees and loans described in the following paragraphs 
the following table sets forth the scheduled maturities of our share of the outstanding debt of our unconsolidated joint ventures as of december  in thousands thereafter in connection with the des moines joint ventures  we guaranteed certain debt and the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under the guarantees is million 
of this amount  million arose from housing revenue bonds that require credit enhancements in addition to the real estate 
table of contents mortgages 
the bonds bear a floating interest rate  which at december  averaged  and mature in guarantees of million of debt of the des moines joint ventures will expire upon two industrial buildings becoming and leased or when the related loans mature 
as of december   these buildings were and leased  respectively 
the remaining million in guarantees of debt of the des moines joint ventures relate to loans on four office buildings that were in the lease up phase at the time the loans were initiated 
each of the loans will mature by may the average occupancy of the four buildings at december  was 
if the joint ventures are unable to repay the outstanding balances under the loans that we have guaranteed  we will be required  under the terms of the agreements  to repay the outstanding balances 
recourse provisions exist that enable us to recover some or all of such payments from the joint ventures assets and or the other partners 
the joint ventures currently generate sufficient cash flow to cover the debt service required by the loans 
as a result  no liability has been recorded on our balance sheet 
in connection with the rrhwoods  llc joint venture  we renewed our guarantee of million to a bank in july  this guarantee expires in august and may be renewed by us 
the bank provides a letter of credit securing industrial revenue bonds  which mature in we would be required to perform under the guarantee should the joint venture be unable to repay the bonds 
we have recourse provisions in order to recover from the joint venture s assets and the other partner for amounts paid in excess of our proportionate share 
the property collateralizing the bonds is leased and currently generates sufficient cash flow to cover the debt service required by the bond financing 
as a result  no liability has been recorded in our balance sheet 
on december   the plaza colonnade  llc joint venture refinanced its construction loan with a million non recourse permanent loan  thereby releasing us from our former guarantees of a construction loan agreement and a construction completion agreement  which arose from the formation of the joint venture to construct an office building 
the million mortgage bears a fixed interest rate of  requires monthly principal and interest payments and matures on january  we and our joint venture partner have signed a contingent master lease limited to  square feet for five years 
our maximum exposure under this master lease is million 
however  the current occupancy level of the building is sufficient to cover all debt service requirements 
the likelihood of us paying on the master lease is remote 
on march   the industrial development authority of the city of kansas city  missouri issued million in non recourse bonds to finance public improvements made by the plaza colonnade  llc joint venture for the benefit of the kansas city missouri public library 
since the joint venture leases the land for the office building from the library  the joint venture was obligated to build certain public improvements 
the net bond proceeds were million and will be used for project and debt service costs 
the joint venture has recorded this obligation on its balance sheet 
the bonds are ultimately paid by the tax increment financing revenue generated by the building and its tenants 
in the highwoods dlf dlf  lp joint venture  a single tenant currently leases an entire building under a lease scheduled to expire on june  the tenant also leases space in other buildings owned by us 
in conjunction with an overall restructuring of the tenant s leases with us and with this joint venture  we agreed to certain changes to the lease with the joint venture in september the modifications included allowing the tenant to vacate the premises on january   and reducing the rent obligation by and converting the net lease to a full service lease with the tenant liable for of these costs at that time 
in turn  we agreed to compensate the joint venture for any economic losses incurred as a result of these lease modifications 
based on the lease guarantee agreement  in september  we recorded million in other liabilities and million as a deferred charge in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
however  should new tenants occupy the vacated space during the two and a half year guarantee period  our liability under the guarantee would diminish

rrhwoods  llc and dallas county partners each developed a new office building in des moines  iowa 
on june   the joint ventures financed both buildings with a million ten year loan from a lender 
as an inducement to make the loan at a long term rate  we and our partner agreed to master lease the vacant space and each guaranteed million of the debt with limited recourse 
as leasing improves  the guarantee obligations under the loan agreement diminish 
as of december  we expensed our share of the master lease payments totaling million and recorded million in other liabilities and million as a deferred charge included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet with respect to this guarantee 
the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make based on the current leases in place is approximately million as of december  the likelihood of us paying on our million guarantee is believed to be remote since the master lease payments enable the joint ventures to satisfy the minimum debt coverage ratio and should we be required to pay our portion of the guarantee  we would recover the million from other joint venture assets

we recorded a million contingent liability with respect to such guarantee as of june  and reduced the total amount of gain to be recognized by the same amount 
during  we paid million in re tenanting costs related to this guarantee 
we believe our estimate related to the re tenanting costs guarantee is accurate 
however  if our assumptions prove to be incorrect  future losses may occur 
the contribution was accounted for as a partial sale as defined by sfas no 
and we recognized a million gain in june since we have an ongoing financial interest in the joint venture and since we are engaged by the joint venture to provide management and leasing services for the joint venture  for which we receive customary management fees and leasing commissions  the operations of these properties were not reflected as discontinued operations consistent with sfas no

the other partner contributed million of cash and a new loan was obtained by the partnership for million 
in connection with this disposition  we entered into a master lease agreement with harborview lp for five years on the then vacant space in the building approximately of the building  occupancy was at december  we also guaranteed to harborview lp the payment of tenant improvements and lease commissions of million 
our maximum exposure to loss under the master lease agreement was million at september  and was million at december  additionally  our partner in harborview lp was granted the right to put its equity interest in harborview lp to us in exchange for cash at any time during the one year period commencing on september  the value of the equity interest will be determined at the time that such partner elects to exercise its put right  if ever  based upon the then fair market value of harborview lp s assets and liabilities  less  which amount was intended to cover the normal costs of a sale transaction 
because of the put option and the master lease agreement  this transaction is accounted for as a financing transaction  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  the assets  liabilities and operations related to harborview plaza  the property owned by harborview lp  including any new financing by the partnership  remain on our books 
as a result  we have established a financing obligation equal to the net equity contributed by the other partner 
at the end of each reporting period  the balance of the financing obligation is adjusted to equal the current fair value  which is million at december   but not less than the original financing obligation 
this adjustment is amortized prospectively through september additionally  the net income from the operations before depreciation of harborview plaza allocable to the partner is recorded as interest expense on financing obligation 
we continue to depreciate the property and record all of the depreciation on our books 
any payments made under the master lease agreement were expensed as incurred million  million and million was expensed during the years ended december   and  respectively and any amounts paid under the tenant improvement and lease commission guarantee are capitalized and amortized to expense over the remaining lease term

our maximum exposure to loss under the rental guarantee agreements was million at the date of sale and was million as of december  no payments were made during or in respect of these rent guarantees 
however  in june  we began to make monthly payments to the buyer  at an annual rate of million  as a result of the existing tenant renewing a lease in one building at a lower rental rate 
these rent guarantees are a form of continuing involvement as discussed in paragraph of sfas no 
because the guarantees cover the entire space occupied by a single tenant under a triple net lease arrangement  our guarantees are considered a guaranteed return on the buyer s investment for an extended period of time 
therefore  the transaction has been accounted for as a financing transaction following the accounting method described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  the assets  liabilities and operations are included in the consolidated financial statements  and a financing obligation of million was recorded which represents the amount received from the buyer  adjusted for subsequent activity 
the income from the operations of the properties  other than depreciation  is allocated to the owner as interest expense on a financing obligation 
payments made under the rent guarantees are charged to expense as incurred 
this transaction was recorded as a completed sale transaction in the third quarter of when the maximum exposure to loss under the guarantees became less than the related gain  deferred gain will be recognized in future periods as the maximum exposure under the guarantees is reduced

in addition  we have assumed fixed rate and variable rate debt in connection with acquiring properties 
our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  from time to time we may enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as collars  swaps  caps and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments 
we do not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
the following table sets forth information regarding our interest rate hedge contract as of december  in thousands type of hedge notional amount maturity date reference rate fixed rate fair market value interest rate swap  month usd libor bba the interest rate on all of our variable rate debt is adjusted at one and three month intervals  subject to settlements under these interest rate hedge contracts 
we also enter into treasury lock agreements from time to time in order to limit our exposure to an increase in interest rates with respect to future debt offerings 
during  only a nominal amount was received from counter parties under interest rate hedge contracts 
the interest rate swap that matured on june  was not renewed or extended 
we currently have no outstanding interest rate hedge contracts 
as further described below under related party transactions  the company had an embedded derivative as part of the land purchase arrangement with gapi  inc related party transactions we have previously reported that we have had a contract to acquire development land in the bluegrass valley office development project from gapi  inc  a corporation controlled by gene h 
anderson  an executive officer and director of the company 
under the terms of the contract  the development land is to be purchased in phases  and the purchase price for each phase or parcel is settled for in cash and or common units 
the price for the various parcels 
table of contents is based on an initial value for each parcel  adjusted for an interest factor  currently per annum  applied up to the closing date and also for changes in the value of the common units 
on january   we acquired an additional acres of this land from gapi  inc for  shares of common stock and  in cash for total consideration of million 
in may  acres of the remaining acres not yet acquired by us was taken by the georgia department of transportation to develop a roadway interchange for consideration of million 
the department of transportation took possession and title of the property in june as part of the terms of the contract between us and gapi  inc  we were entitled to and received in the million proceeds from the condemnation 
in july  we appealed the condemnation and are currently seeking additional payment from the state  the recognition of any gain has been deferred pending resolution of the appeal process 
in april  we acquired for cash an additional acres of the bluegrass valley land from gapi  inc and also settled for cash the final purchase price with gapi  inc on the acres that were taken by the georgia department of transportation  which aggregated approximately million  of which million was recorded as a payable to gapi  inc on the company s financial statements as of december  in august  we acquired acres  representing the last parcel of land to be acquired  for cash aggregating million 
we believe that the purchase price with respect to each land parcel was at or below market value 
these transactions were unanimously approved by the full board of directors with mr 
anderson abstaining from the vote 
the contract provided that the land parcels could be paid in common units or in cash  at the option of the seller 
this feature constituted an embedded derivative pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the embedded derivative feature is accounted for separately and adjusted based on changes in the fair value of the common units 
this resulted in an increase to other income of million in  and a decrease to other income of and million in and  respectively 
in  an additional million expense was recorded related to the embedded derivative  which expired upon the closing of the final land transaction in august we entered into a series of agreements in january and february  pursuant to which we  through a third party broker  sold on february  and april   three non core industrial buildings in winston salem  north carolina to john l 
turner  a director of the company  and certain of his affiliates in exchange for a gross sales price of approximately million  of which million was paid in cash and the remainder from the surrender of  common units in the operating partnership 
we recorded a gain of approximately million upon the closing of these sales 
we believe that the purchase price paid for these assets by mr 
turner and his affiliates was equal to their fair market value 
the sales were unanimously approved by the full board of directors with mr 
turner not being present to discuss or vote on the matter 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
the policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  however  certain of our significant accounting policies contain an increased level of assumptions used or estimates made in determining their impact on our consolidated financial statements 
management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and the company s independent auditors 
we consider our critical accounting estimates to be those used in the determination of the reported amounts and disclosure related to the following real estate and related assets  sales of real estate  allowance for doubtful accounts  and property operating expense recoveries 

table of contents real estate and related assets real estate and related assets are recorded at cost and stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
renovations  replacements and other expenditures that improve or extend the life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of years for buildings and depreciable land infrastructure costs  years for building improvements and five to seven years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
tenant improvements are amortized over the life of the respective leases using the straight line method 
expenditures directly related to the development and construction of real estate assets are included in net real estate assets and are stated at cost in the consolidated balance sheets 
our capitalization policy on development properties is in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs and the initial rental operations of real estate properties  sfas no 
 capitalization of interest costs  and sfas no 
 capitalization of interest cost in financial statements that include investments accounted for by the equity method 
development expenditures include pre construction costs essential to the development of properties  development and construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development 
interest and other carrying costs are capitalized until the building is ready for its intended use 
we consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements  but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity 
we cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy  and capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction 
expenditures directly related to the leasing of properties are included in deferred leasing costs and are stated at cost in the consolidated balance sheets 
we capitalize initial direct costs related to our leasing efforts in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases 
all leasing commissions paid to third parties for new leases or lease renewals are capitalized 
internal leasing costs include primarily compensation  benefits and other costs such as legal fees related to leasing activities that are incurred in connection with successfully securing leases on the properties 
capitalized leasing costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated lives of the respective leases 
estimated costs related to unsuccessful activities are expensed as incurred 
if our assumptions regarding the successful efforts of leasing are incorrect  the resulting adjustments could impact earnings 
upon the acquisition of real estate  we assess the fair value of acquired tangible assets such as land  buildings and tenant improvements  intangible assets such as above and below market leases  acquired in place leases and other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
we allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their relative fair values 
we assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and or capitalization rates as well as available market information 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant 
above and below market leases acquired are recorded at their fair value 
fair value is calculated as the present value of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease  using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired and measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases 
the capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of base rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases and the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases and any below market option periods 
if a tenant vacates its space prior to its contractual expiration date  any unamortized balance is adjusted through rental revenue 
the value of in place leases is based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease 
factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods  current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  depending on local market conditions 
in estimating costs to execute similar leases  we consider tenant 
table of contents improvements  leasing commissions and legal and other related expenses 
the value of in place leases is amortized to depreciation and amortization expense over the remaining term of the respective leases 
if a tenant vacates its space prior to its contractual expiration date  any unamortized balance of its related intangible asset is expensed 
the value of a tenant relationship is based on our overall relationship with the respective tenant 
factors considered include the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals 
the value of a tenant relationship is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods defined in the respective leases 
based on our acquisitions since the adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 we have deemed tenant relationships to be immaterial and have not allocated any amounts to this intangible asset 
real estate and leasehold improvements are classified as long lived assets held for sale or as long lived assets to be held for use 
real estate is classified as held for sale when the criteria set forth in sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  are satisfied  this determination requires management to make estimates and assumptions  including assessing the probability that potential sales transactions may or may not occur 
actual results could differ from those assumptions 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we record assets held for sale at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value 
fair value of assets held for sale is equal to the estimated or contracted sales price with a potential buyer less costs to sell 
the impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value 
with respect to assets classified as held for use  if events or changes in circumstances  such as a significant decline in occupancy and change in use  indicate that the carrying value may be impaired  an impairment analysis is performed 
such analysis consists of determining whether the asset s carrying amount will be recovered from its undiscounted estimated future operating cash flows 
these cash flows are estimated based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including  among others  demand for space  competition for tenants  changes in market rental rates and costs to operate each property 
if the carrying amount of a held for use asset exceeds the sum of its undiscounted future operating and residual cash flows  an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between estimated fair value of the asset and the net carrying amount 
we generally estimate the fair value of assets held for use by using discounted cash flow analysis  in some instances  appraisal information may be available and is used in addition to the discounted cash flow analysis 
as the factors used in generating these cash flows are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions  the discounted and or undiscounted future operating and residual cash flows estimated by us in our impairment analyses or those established by appraisal may not be achieved and we may be required to recognize future impairment losses on our properties held for sale and held for use 
sales of real estate we account for sales of real estate in accordance with sfas no 
for sales transactions meeting the requirements of sfas no 
for full profit recognition  the related assets and liabilities are removed from the balance sheet and the resultant gain or loss is recorded in the period the transaction closes 
for sales transactions that do not meet the criteria for full profit recognition  we account for the transactions in accordance with the methods specified in sfas no 
for sales transactions with continuing involvement after the sale  if the continuing involvement with the property is limited by the terms of the sales contract  profit is recognized at the time of sale and is reduced by the maximum exposure to loss related to the nature of the continuing involvement 
sales to entities in which we have an interest are accounted for in accordance with partial sale accounting provisions as set forth in sfas no 
for sales transactions that do not meet sale criteria as set forth in sfas no 
 we evaluate the nature of the continuing involvement  including put and call provisions  if present  and account for the transaction as a financing arrangement  profit sharing arrangement or other alternate method of accounting rather than as a sale  based on the nature and extent of the continuing involvement 
some transactions may have numerous forms of continuing involvement 
in those cases  we determine which method is most appropriate based on the substance of the transaction 
if we have an obligation to repurchase the property at a higher price or at a future indeterminable value such as fair market value  or we guarantee the return of the buyer s investment or a return on that investment for an extended period  we account for such transaction as a financing transaction 
if we have an option to repurchase the property at a higher price and it is likely we will exercise this option  the transaction is accounted for as a financing transaction 
for transactions treated as financings  we record the amounts received from the buyer as a financing obligation and continue to keep the property and related accounts recorded on our books 
the results of operations 
table of contents of the property  net of expenses other than depreciation net operating income  will be reflected as interest expense on the financing obligation 
if the transaction includes an obligation or option to repurchase the asset at a higher price  additional interest is recorded to accrete the liability to the repurchase price 
for options or obligations to repurchase the asset at fair market value at the end of each reporting period  the balance of the liability is adjusted to equal the current fair value to the extent fair value exceeds the original financing obligation 
the corresponding debit or credit will be recorded to a related discount account and the revised debt discount is amortized over the expected term until termination of the option or obligation 
if it is unlikely such option will be exercised  the transaction is accounted for under the deposit method or profit sharing method 
if we have an obligation or option to repurchase at a lower price  the transaction is accounted for as a leasing arrangement 
at such time as these repurchase obligations expire  a sale will be recorded and gain recognized 
if we retain an interest in the buyer and provide certain rent guarantees or other forms of support where the maximum exposure to loss exceeds the gain  we account for such transaction as a profit sharing arrangement 
for transactions treated as profit sharing arrangements  we record a profit sharing obligation for the amount of equity contributed by the other partner and continue to keep the property and related accounts recorded on our books 
the results of operations of the property  net of expenses other than depreciation net operating income  will be allocated to the other partner for their percentage interest and reflected as co venture expense in our consolidated financial statements 
in future periods  a sale is recorded and profit is recognized when the remaining maximum exposure to loss is reduced below the amount of gain deferred 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
our receivable balance is comprised primarily of rents and operating cost recoveries due from tenants as well as accrued straight line rents receivable 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the evaluation primarily consists of reviewing past due account balances and considering such factors as the credit quality of our tenant  historical trends of the tenant and or other debtor  current economic conditions and changes in customer payment terms 
additionally  with respect to tenants in bankruptcy  we estimate the expected recovery through bankruptcy claims and increase the allowance for amounts deemed uncollectible 
if our assumptions regarding the collectibility of accounts receivable prove incorrect  we could experience write offs of accounts receivable or accrued straight line rents receivable in excess of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
property operating expense recoveries property operating cost recoveries from tenants or cost reimbursements are determined on a lease by lease basis 
the most common types of cost reimbursements in our leases are common area maintenance cam and real estate taxes  where the tenant pays a share of operating and administrative expenses and real estate taxes  as determined in each lease 
the computation of cost reimbursements from tenants for cam and real estate taxes is complex and involves numerous judgments  including the interpretation of terms and other tenant lease provisions 
leases are not uniform in dealing with such cost reimbursements and there are many variations in the computations 
many tenants make monthly fixed payments of cam  real estate taxes and other cost reimbursement items 
we record these payments as income each month 
we also make adjustments  positive or negative  to cost recovery income to adjust the recorded amounts to our best estimate of the final amounts to be billed and collected with respect to the cost reimbursements 
after the end of the calendar year  we compute each tenant s final cost reimbursements and  after considering amounts paid by the tenant during the year  issue a bill or credit for the appropriate amount to the tenant 
the differences between the amounts billed less previously received payments and the accrual adjustment are recorded as increases or decreases to cost recovery income when the final bills are prepared  usually beginning in march and completed by mid year 
the net amounts of any such adjustments have not been material in the years presented 
funds from operations we believe that ffo and ffo per share are beneficial to management and investors and are important indicators of the performance of any equity reit 
because ffo and ffo per share calculations exclude such factors as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost 
table of contents accounting and useful life estimates  they facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other reits 
our management believes that historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
as a result  management believes that the use of ffo and ffo per share  together with the required gaap presentations  provide a more complete understanding of the company s performance relative to its competitors and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating  financing and investing activities 
ffo and ffo per share as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation of ffo and ffo per share as described below 
however  you should be aware that ffo and ffo per share are non gaap financial measures and therefore do not represent net income or net income per share as defined by gaap 
net income and net income per share as defined by gaap are the most relevant measures in determining our operating performance because ffo and ffo per share include adjustments that investors may deem subjective  such as adding back expenses such as depreciation and amortization 
furthermore  ffo per share does not depict the amount that accrues directly to the stockholders benefit 
accordingly  ffo and ffo per share should never be considered as alternatives to net income or net income per share as indicators of our operating performance 
our calculation of ffo  which we believe is consistent with the calculation of ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit and which appropriately excludes the cost of capital improvements and related capitalized interest  is as follows net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  less dividends to holders of preferred stock  plus depreciation and amortization of assets uniquely significant to the real estate industry  less gains  or plus losses  from sales of depreciable operating properties but excluding impairment losses and items that are classified as extraordinary items under gaap  plus minority interest  plus or minus adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures to reflect funds from operations on the same basis  and plus or minus adjustments for depreciation and amortization and gains losses on sales and minority interest related to discontinued operations 
other reits may not define ffo in accordance with the current nareit definition or may interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the effects of potential changes in interest rates are discussed below 
our market risk discussion includes forward looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in interest rates 
these disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future effects  but only indicators of reasonably possible effects 
as a result  actual future results may differ materially from those presented 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting policies and other information related to these financial instruments 
to meet in part our long term liquidity requirements  we borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates 
borrowings under our revolving loan and bank term loans bear interest at variable rates 
our long term debt  which consists of secured and unsecured long term financings and the issuance of unsecured debt securities  typically bears interest at fixed rates although some loans bear interest at variable rates 
in addition  we have assumed fixed rate and variable rate debt in connection with acquiring properties 
our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  from time to time we enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as collars  swaps  caps and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments 
we do not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
as of december   we had  million of fixed rate debt outstanding 
the estimated aggregate fair value of this debt at december  was  million 
if interest rates increase by basis points  the aggregate fair market value of our fixed rate debt as of december  would decrease by approximately million 
if interest rates decrease by basis points  the aggregate fair market value of our fixed rate debt as of december  would increase by approximately million 
as of december   we had million of variable rate debt outstanding 
of that amount  million was not protected by interest rate hedge contracts 
if the weighted average interest rate on this variable rate debt is basis points higher or lower  our annual interest expense would be decreased or increased million 
for a discussion of our interest rate hedge contract in effect at december   see management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations liquidity and capital resources interest rate hedging activities 
if interest rates increase by basis points  the aggregate fair market value of this interest rate hedge contract as of december  would have increased by million 
if interest rates decrease by basis points  the aggregate fair market value of this interest rate hedge contract as of december  would have decreased by million 
this interest rate hedge contract matured on june  and was not renewed or extended 
we currently have no outstanding interest rate hedge contracts 
at december   we had an embedded derivative as part of a land purchase arrangements  as described under item management s dicussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources related party transactions 
in  a loss of million was recorded on this embedded derivative which expired in august upon closing of the final land parcel under the arrangement 
in addition  we are exposed to certain losses in the event of nonperformance by the counter parties under any outstanding hedge contracts 
we expect the counter parties  which are major financial institutions  to perform fully under any such contracts 
however  if any of the counter parties was to default on its obligation under an interest rate hedge contract  we could be required to pay the full rates on our debt  even if such rates were in excess of the rate in the contract
