item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  manufacture  integrate  install and sell products  systems and software used in the ground based portion of satellite communication systems to receive  and transmit data  video  audio and internet over satellite  microwave and cable communications networks 
our products are used in applications for telephone  data  video and audio broadcast communications  private and corporate data networks  internet applications  and digital television for cable and network broadcast 
through our network of international offices and service centers  we serve customers in over countries  including customers in the television broadcast industry  international telecommunications companies  internet service providers  private communications networks  network and cable television and the united states government 
we reported revenues of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decline in revenues is due  in part  to the company s decision to withdraw from bidding on service business jobs and focus on our higher margin products 
in addition  our customers trend had been to reduce capital expenditures to the most urgent needs 
we believe the urgency for these companies to begin expending funds for new capital equipment will increase in the near term as older products fail and as newer product technologies improve the operating efficiencies of the users  saving them money over use of their older technologies 
we also believe that continued demand for capital equipment in the hdtv industry will drive demand for the company s products 
we have recently introduced new products with the latest technologies that can help our customers reduce their operational costs while increasing their capacity to deliver services 
the products have lowered cost of manufacture compared to the products that they replace which results in increased gross margins 
on march   radyne comstream announced its intention to acquire xicom technology inc xicom is a leading provider of satellite and microwave power amplifiers and other rf products 
the combination of xicom s amplifier products and rf technologies with radyne s line of satellite modems and other satellite communications equipment would make the company a full line supplier of satellite electronic systems 
the acquisition brings an increased customer base for both companies products as well as the potential of offering complete system solutions 
we believe that there is additional opportunity to create new products based on the combined technology of radyne comstream s existing products and xicom s offering 
further  this acquisition  if completed should result in greater sales relative to fixed costs which should  in turn  increase the company s operating leverage or profitability 
during the third quarter of  we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce costs and address the economic slowdown and negative industry conditions 
this plan included the reduction in force of approximately of our workforce in the manufacturing  research and development and sales departments  the abandonment of certain non performing and under performing product lines and a provision for the excess space created at the san diego facility as a result of these cost cutting measures 
this effort resulted in a charge to our operating expenses of approximately million  of which  was charged to cost of sales and the balance was charged to restructuring charge 
this amount included  in severance costs 
during the year ended december   we paid all charges except for  in lease exit costs 
during the years ended december  and   and  in lease exit costs were paid and the remaining  was paid in january and february at december   our workforce consisted of full time employees  which is reduced from and at december  and critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the company s management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
such estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  income taxes  warranty obligations  and contingencies based upon historical results  anticipated future events and various other assumptions  factors  and circumstances 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 

table of contents management believes the company s most critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements relate to revenue recognition 
revenues from product sales are recognized upon the actual shipment of product and transfer of the risk of ownership from us  or our contract manufacturers  to our customers in accordance with sec staff bulletins no 
revenue recognition and no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended 
we do not sell through distributors and we do not use consignment resellers as a method of selling our products 
revenue from services principally consists of sales related to services for installation and integration of satellite earth stations and video and microwave hub stations and are recognized at the time the services are performed 
we consider products and services as separate units of accounting under eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
valuation of receivables 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
bad debt reserves are recorded based upon historic default averages as well as through the creation of reserves established for specific customers deemed marginal in their ability to pay based upon factors known at that time 
in general  if the financial condition of a customer was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
valuation and impairment of intangible assets 
in assessing our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas we are required to make significant assumptions about the future cash flows  overall performance  identity and allocation and valuation of the assets including goodwill and other intangibles of our reporting units 
market prices are not readily available for certain businesses  unique physical assets  and most intangible assets to be evaluated in goodwill impairment tests 
therefore  we estimate fair values using estimating techniques and assumptions that are matters of judgment 
our transitional impairment analysis of goodwill as of january   as required by sfas  yielded an impairment charge of million  recorded in as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
we have no remaining goodwill on our balance sheet as of december  and assuming it is completed  we anticipate that the xicom acquisition will result in goodwill 
in that event  we will apply the provisions of sfas warranty liability 
we provide limited warranties on certain of our products and systems for periods generally not exceeding two years 
estimated warranty costs for potential product liability and warranty claims based on our claim experience are accrued as cost of sales at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our vendors  our warranty liability is affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company s present estimates  additional warranty liabilities may be required 
valuation of inventories 
inventories  consisting of satellite modems and related products  are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
our inventories include high technology components and systems sold into rapidly changing and competitive markets  whereby such inventories may be subject to technological obsolescence 
we evaluate inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories unmarketable at normal margins 
write downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate net realizable value 
assumptions about future demand  market conditions and decisions to discontinue certain product lines can impact the decision to write down inventories 
if assumptions about future demand change or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
in any case  actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
accounting for income taxes 
management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of our net operating loss carry forwards is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize the recorded value 
in addition  we consider historic levels of income  expectations and risk associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing a tax valuation allowance 
should we determine that we are not able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  a valuation allowance is recorded against the deferred tax assets with a corresponding charge to income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment 
table of contents to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets would result in an income tax benefit in the period such determination was made 
results of operations sales net sales generally consist of sales of products  net of returns and allowances 
our sales have come predominantly from satellite modems  video signal encoders  point to point modems  internet over satellite systems and systems integrations and installations 
the following tables summarize the year over year comparison of our revenue for the periods indicated vs 
years ended december  in thousands change sales for the year  sales decreased million  or from the prior year this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in sales from our systems integrations and installation service which accounted for a decrease of million in sales from to the decision was made due to the very competitive nature of this portion of the market and the relative low benefit we believe we received for being in the business 
this resulted in lower sales  but higher margins  as we concentrated on delivery of our core products and development of new higher margin products 
based on orders received during the last quarter  management believes that continued growth in shipments of these newly introduced products will result in recovery of sales in the future 
vs 
years ended december  in thousands change sales our net sales increased to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to improved market conditions for our core products and offset by a reduction of sales in our systems integration and installation products and strengthening of the economy as a whole during the last half of the year ended december  compared to the same period in while revenues did not increase dramatically from year to year  the first three months of was depressed  in terms of sales  resulting in our lowest volume of quarterly sales in four years 
sales during the last three quarters of the year continuously improved and  in total  the last nine months of the year increased by over the prior year s last nine months 
cost of sales cost of sales generally consists of costs associated with components  outsourced manufacturing and in house labor associated with assembly  testing  packaging  shipping and quality assurance  depreciation of manufacturing equipment and indirect manufacturing costs 
gross profit is the difference between net sales and cost of sales 
gross margin is gross profit stated as a percentage of net sales 
the following tables summarize the year over year comparison of our cost of sales  gross profit and gross margin for the periods indicated vs 
years ended december  in thousands change cost of sales gross profit gross margin 
table of contents during  gross profit was million  a increase from due primarily to a change in our product and service mix in as compared to these lower costs resulted from the previously mentioned decision to withdraw from bidding on installation and integration jobs and low margin products during the second quarter of and to concentrate on our core products  which produce higher margins and the introduction of new products with reduced costs to manufacture 
gross margins increased to of net sales for compared to in gross margins for the year benefited from a larger portion of our total sales being made up of our new higher margin products as compared to  primarily from our new satellite modems that replaced the sales of our lower margin system integration services 
management believes that the company may not be able to continue to increase gross margins in the future due to increased competition and larger customer orders 
vs 
years ended december  in thousands change cost of sales gross profit gross margin during  gross profit was million  a increase from primarily due to a change in our product and services mix 
our service and installation business  which provides lower gross margins relative to certain products such as satellite modems  decreased to of sales for the year ended december  from in the prior year 
sales from services typically produce margins in the to range compared to the satellite modem products that produce margins in the to range 
our newest products enable us to sell software upgrades over a satellite link or via email 
these upgrades are made through the use of a cdrom or pcm cia card that can be installed into the product after the initial sale 
these upgrades can increase our sales by up to of the hardware sales price without significant increases in costs 
this should help sustain improved margins during the years to come  especially after we have an established base of product deployed in the field 
selling  general  and administrative costs sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries  commissions for marketing and support personnel  and travel 
executives and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses of our finance  human resources  information systems  and other administrative personnel as well as facilities  professional fees  depreciation and amortization and related expenses 
the following tables summarize the year over year comparison of our selling  general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated vs 
years ended december  in thousands change selling  general administrative selling  general and administrative expenses  for  were higher than the same period in  due mainly to the following increases management incentive plan million  professional fees related to compliance with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of  section sox compliance  and commissions  these increases were partially offset by a reduction in costs as follows acquisition costs  a reduction in personnel  and amortization expense  except for sales commissions and performance based management incentives  most of our selling  general and administrative expenses are fixed and do not change when sales fluctuate 
like other public companies  our expenses related to ongoing compliance with sox are uncertain 
vs 
years ended december  in thousands change selling  general administrative 
table of contents selling  general and administrative costs increased to million  or of net sales  during the year ended december  from million  or of sales  for the year ended december  expenses attributable to our aborted tender offer for wegener corporation amounted to approximately  during the second quarter of the year 
before these expenses  selling  general and administrative costs decreased slightly from the prior year 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel related costs  development material and other product development expense 
the following tables summarize the year over year comparison of our research and development expenses for the periods indicated vs 
years ended december  in thousands change research development research and development expenses decreased in the decrease was due to a reduction of personnel and reduced overhead expenses 
we remain committed to invest in our future through technological advances and efforts to improve our older product lines for improve manufacturability and lower costs 
our research and development personnel concentrate on technology for the satellite and microwave communications  telecommunications  and cable television industries  as well as the tiernan product lines  which target the digital television broadcast industry 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase in the coming year as the company expands the development and introduction of new products 
vs 
years ended december  in thousands change research development research and development expenses decreased to million  or of net sales during the year ended december  from million  or of net sales  during the year ended december  research and development costs decreased during the year ended december  by approximately million  as we benefited from the cost savings initiatives put into place in interest expense interest expense was  and  for the years ended december  and respectively as compared to  for the year ended december  the reduction in interest expense is due to lower capitalized lease obligations in and as compared to interest and other income other income increased to  in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december  and  during the year ended december  other income is comprised primarily of interest income  which increased as a result of higher average interest rates during as compared to and in addition  we maintained a higher average cash balance during and as compared to we keep our cash in money market accounts and short term aaa rated investments maturing in seven to twenty eight day increments 
we expect that interest income will decline in the coming year as the company uses available cash to pursue the xicom and other acquisitions  repurchase stock and invest in other business opportunities 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
income taxes benefit we recorded an income tax benefit during the year ended december  of million compared to income tax expense of million in the year ended december  we recorded an income tax benefit of  in due to a tax refund 
during the year ended december   the company reduced the valuation allowance related to the deferred tax assets by  based on management s belief that it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized through the generation of future taxable income 
of this net reduction in the valuation allowance  approximately  was recorded as a reduction of income tax expense  approximately  was recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital and approximately  was recorded as an increase in deferred tax assets 
in addition to the  increase in additional paid in capital for the release of the valuation allowance related to the tax benefits of stock option exercises in prior years  additional paid in capital was increased for the tax benefit of stock option exercises during the year ended december  in the amount of approximately  for a total increase of approximately  as of december   the company has total deferred tax assets of  with a corresponding valuation allowance of  the valuation allowance applies to the deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards which management believes are limited as to utilization under internal revenue service code section the company generated taxable income in each of the four quarters of  the last three quarters of and projects future taxable income to be able to use the net deferred tax assets 
management believes that past profitable performance and the forecast of future profits supports the recognition of the deferred tax assets and the reduction of the valuation allowance 

table of contents ultimate realization of any or all of the deferred tax assets is not assured due to significant uncertainties associated with estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward periods and is subject to change depending on the tax laws in effect in the years in which the carryforwards are used 
management will continue to evaluate the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and will adjust the valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax assets accordingly 
net earnings net earnings are the result of reducing gross profit by operating expenses  interest expense  income taxes and increasing for other interest income and income tax benefits 
the following tables summarize our net earnings and the earnings available to each fully diluted share of our common stock vs 
years ended december  in thousands change net earnings earnings per diluted share net earnings were million  or per share on a fully diluted basis  for the year ended december   compared to earnings of million  or per share on a fully diluted basis  for the year ended net earnings were higher in part due to the million tax benefit we received in versus a million tax expense in and the million increase in gross profit as discussed above 
these factors were partially offset by an increase in selling  general and administrative expense  also discussed above 
going forward  the company does not expect to maintain this level of profitability due to the one time nature of the tax benefit we recognized in vs 
years ended december  in thousands change net earnings loss    n a earnings per diluted share n a net earnings were million  or per share on a diluted basis  for the year ended december   compared to a loss of million  or per share on a diluted basis  for the year ended the increase in net earnings is primarily due to the increase in gross profit and reduction in operating expenses as discussed above 
bookings and backlog bookings consist of orders taken while backlog is the total of these orders not yet shipped at the end of the period 
the following tables summarize our bookings orders taken and backlog orders to be shipped in future periods 
years ended december  in thousands change bookings ending backlog 
table of contents during  bookings increased compared to this increase was mostly a result of higher fourth quarter bookings of million compared to million in the increase in backlog is due to the higher fourth quarter bookings  much of which remained in backlog at the end of the year 
our backlog consists of orders evidenced by written contracts and or purchase orders from customers with fixed pricing and delivery dates 
we charge cancellation charges for orders that cancel and the net difference between the backlog amount and the cancellation charge is recorded as a negative booking 
there is no guarantee that cancellation charges will ultimately be paid to us 
although the company s backlog increased at year due to record orders in the fourth quarter  we believe that the trend towards increased receiving and shipping orders in the same quarter will continue as customers continue to order our products on an as needed basis and we offer improved delivery times 
years ended december  in thousands change bookings ending backlog new orders booked decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  we believe this trend was due to the reluctance of our customers to place long term capital equipment orders in the aftermath of the economic downturn of the last few years 
our backlog was million as of december  a decrease of from the million in backlog as of december  we believe that this reduction was a result of our customers desires to reduce their inventory levels  shorten cycle times for filling orders and to keep their capital equipment orders to a minimum 
liquidity and capital resources the company had cash and cash equivalents totaling million at december  compared to million at december   an increase of million 
the primary factors in the increase were cash provided by operations of million  the issuance of common stock through the exercise of stock options of million and the sale of common stock to employees of  these were partially offset by the repurchase of the company s common stock for million and capital expenditures of  working capital increased to million at december  from million at december  operating activities during  net cash provided by operating activities was million as compared to million for net cash provided by operating activities for resulted primarily from million of net earnings  depreciation and amortization of million  a tax benefit on stock option exercises of million and an increase of million in accrued expenses 
these were partially offset by increases in deferred tax assets of million and increases in asset accounts of million including accounts receivable  inventory and prepaid expenses and other current assets 
cash was further reduced by a decrease in customer advance payments of  and a decrease in accounts payable  during  net cash provided by operating activities was million 
net cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from million of net earnings  deferred income taxes of million  a decrease in inventories of million and depreciation and amortization of million

the company received   and  for the years ended december   and for proceeds from disposal of assets 
although  the company does not have any material commitments for capital expenditures planned during the next twelve months  the company has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire xicom technology inc which will require investment of million of cash and million of

this cash amount includes approximately million as part of the purchase consideration and approximately million to retire existing xicom debt 
financing activities during  net cash used in financing activities was  while net cash was provided by financing activities of million and  for years ended december  and during  the company used million of cash to repurchase shares of its common stock

the amount of credit available to us under the credit agreement at december  was approximately million 
we paid approximately  for a facility fee and bank costs for a two year commitment on the arrangement  whether or not any amounts are actually drawn on the line of credit 
at december  and  we had no borrowings against the line of credit 
the credit agreement expires on may  and limits or prohibits mergers  consolidations  acquisitions  transfers of assets  liens  loans and investments in other entities and limits the use of proceeds  acquisitions of assets  indebtedness and capital expenditures without the bank s consent 
to be eligible to draw funds under the line of credit  the credit agreement requires us to maintain specific levels of tangible net worth  earnings and other ratios 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  the credit agreement specifies an interest rate between libor plus basis points and prime rate minus basis points depending on terms and other conditions 
we are currently negotiating changes to our credit arrangement to facilitate the xicom acquisition 
we anticipate that these negotiations will result in an larger credit facility with terms and conditions similar to those described above 
in addition  we anticipate that we will draw million to finance the xicom acquisition at the time of acquisition close 
we believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand and anticipated future cash receipts will be sufficient to meet our obligations as they become due for the next twelve months 
however  a decrease in our sales or demand for our products or services would likely affect our working capital amounts 
as part of our business strategy  we occasionally evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies 
accordingly  a portion of our available cash may be used at any time for the acquisition of complementary products or businesses 
these potential transactions may require substantial capital resources  which  in turn  may require us to seek additional debt or equity financing 
there are no assurances that we will be able to consummate any of these transactions

recent accounting pronouncements 
table of contents in november  the fasb issued statement no 
 inventory costs sfas 
sfas requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and spoilage  be charged to expense in the period they are incurred rather than capitalized as a component of inventory costs 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of this standard may result in higher expenses in periods where production levels are lower than normal ranges of production 
we currently believe that the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r is a revision of sfas and supersedes apb among other items  sfas r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
the effective date of sfas r is the first reporting period beginning after june   which is third quarter for calendar year companies  although early adoption is allowed 
sfas r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method  or a modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after that date  and based on the requirements of sfas for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas r 
under the modified retrospective method  the requirements are the same as under the modified prospective method  but also permits entities to restate financial statements of previous periods based on pro forma disclosures made in accordance with sfas the company currently utilizes a standard option pricing model ie  black scholes to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while sfas r permits entities to continue to use such a model  the standard also permits the use of a lattice model 
the company has not yet determined which model it will use to measure the fair value of employee stock options upon the adoption of sfas r 
sfas r also requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date 
these future amounts cannot be estimated  because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
the company currently expects to adopt sfas r effective july   however  the company has not yet determined which of the aforementioned adoption methods it will use 
subject to a complete review of the requirements of sfas r  based on stock options granted to employees through december   and stock options expected to be granted during  the company expects that the adoption of sfas r on july   will reduce both third quarter and fourth quarter net earnings and net earnings per share
