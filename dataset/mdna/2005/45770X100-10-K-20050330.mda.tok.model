item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our selected financial data section  our consolidated financial statements and the information described in the business important factors that may affect our business  our operating results and our stock price section included elsewhere in this report 
description of the company we provide enterprises with scalable data and text analysis solutions designed to drive better decisions faster by revealing patterns  trends and relationships in data 
we are a supplier of software and services for the statistical data mining  business analytics  knowledge management  and information retrieval industry segments enabling customers to gain intelligence from numerical data and text 
our products include s plus and s plus server  insightful miner  infact and various s plus add on modules such as s arrayanalyzer tm  and s finmetrics tm 
our consulting services and training provide specialized expertise and processes for the design  development and deployment of analytical solutions 
our customers primarily consist of companies in financial services  pharmaceuticals  biotechnology  telecommunications and manufacturing  as well as government and research institutions 
headquartered in seattle  washington  we also have north american offices in new york and north carolina 
our international offices are located in france  switzerland  and the united kingdom  with distributors around the world 
business outlook we provide our customers with useful and innovative software and services to derive intelligence from the data they collect 
several converging trends point to what we believe is significant long term potential for the data analysis software market 
first  organizations currently collect far more data  in a variety of formats  than they actually analyze 
second  an increasing amount of additional information is being collected by organizations 
third  organizations are seeking to apply new and increasingly complex analytic techniques to their ever increasing collection of data in order to gain significant improvements in the quality and efficacy of products built  marketed  and sold and to improvements in the efficiency of business processes 
overall  we believe the confluence of these trends presents long term potential for data analysis software companies such as insightful 
our product direction for the s plus product family mirrors these data analysis industry trends 
our focus has been  and will continue to be  to build on s plus position as a leader for statistical model prototyping and data visualization used extensively by individual statisticians building statistical models 
our vision is to continually enhance the s plus product family to provide a seamless environment where sophisticated business analytics can be developed on the desktop and then deployed to other business users in production on servers handling many gigabytes of data and deployed to hundreds and even thousands of users  without the need for expensive re implementation 
we will increasingly enable s plus programmers and other it professionals to use the s plus product family to deploy analytic applications to mission critical production environments 
our direction also involves tailoring our solutions to meet the needs of certain market segments 
throughout our history  we have  to varying degrees  tailored our data analysis solutions to the needs of the following industries securities and banking  life sciences  manufacturing  telecommunications  environmental  and defense intelligence 
our largest efforts have focused on life sciences and financial services 
we also serve the academic community  though our objective there is not to drive short term increased revenues  but rather seed for future commercial sales 
since we are seeing more of our customers explore and adopt open source data analysis technologies  instead of purchasing commercial software products  our direction involves extending our products to provide increasing value add in the form of scaling to large amounts of data as well as tailoring to specific vertical markets 
we are focusing our resources on higher value initiatives in the three industries that currently account for the majority of our revenues life sciences  securities and banking for data analysis  and defense intelligence 
we launched our text analysis product  infact  in april to provide text analysis and relationship search for knowledge workers 
infact combines statistical text mining methods with linguistic techniques that apply natural language processing  such as full sentence deep syntactic parsing  to text search and analysis 
researchers are able to utilize infact s interactive text query language and tabular exploratory search interfaces to efficiently uncover information they are searching for 
infact is designed to enable researchers to experience higher levels of productivity  and to improve the quality of their research 
infact has been initially targeted at the defense intelligence and pharmaceutical markets where we currently have customers using the product 
in  we expect to continue to make significant investments in both our existing and new products in order to position ourselves for potential future growth 
we also expect to expand our sales and marketing efforts and we anticipate investing in our infrastructure as we update our it systems and strive to comply with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of critical accounting policies and estimates we have based our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  intangible assets  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenues are a key component of our results of operations 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines  discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements  in measuring revenues 
we derive our revenues primarily from three sources license revenues  which consist of perpetual and fixed term software license fees  maintenance revenues  consisting of fees for maintenance and support  and professional services revenues  which are comprised of fees for consulting and training 
the revenue recognition rules for software companies are complex and require our management to exercise judgment and make a number of estimates 
for example  many of our contracts contain multiple element arrangements  which require us to make assumptions and judgments in order to allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver  to determine whether vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for each element  to determine if undelivered elements are deemed essential  and to determine whether and when each element has been delivered 
we also evaluate whether there is any material risk of customer non payment or product returns 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  which are made based upon all of the information available to us at the time  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
deferred revenue is recognized over time as the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
sales returns we provide an estimated reserve for return rights at the time of sale 
we offer our customers a day return policy on all of our products 
refunds are provided to customers upon return to us of the complete product package  including all original materials  cd rom or other media 
our provision for sales returns is estimated based on historical returns experience and our judgment of the likelihood of future returns 
bad debts a considerable amount of judgment is required when we assess the ultimate realization of receivables including assessing the aging of the amounts and reviewing the current credit worthiness of our customers 
customer credit worthiness is subject to many business and finance risks facing each customer and is subject to sudden changes 
impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets we evaluate goodwill arising from acquired businesses for potential impairment on an annual basis  during the fourth quarter 
this evaluation requires significant judgment and estimation 
in addition  throughout the year we consider whether there are impairment indicators that would require an immediate evaluation of impairment 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of our acquired businesses 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired business is impaired 
impairment losses  if any  will be charged to earnings in the period in which they are identified 
contingencies we are engaged in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of possible losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual matter 
the required reserves  if any  may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy for a particular matter

the total increase in revenues for  as compared to and the total increase in revenues for  as compared to  included the favorable effects of exchange rate fluctuations on translation of sales at our foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies 
of the total increase in revenues in and in  an estimated million and million  respectively  relate to the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of revenues from our international subsidiaries 
software license revenues consist of software licenses and subscriptions 
the increase in software license revenues for  as compared to  is primarily the result of the growth in s plus subscriptions 
the increase is also due to the increased sales of infact and insightful miner products  as well as due to the growth in sales of vertically focused toolkits of packaged s plus libraries and workflows  such as s finmetrics and s nuopt for the financial services market 
the increase in software license revenue for  as compared to  was primarily due to increased european license revenue  primarily as a result of positive fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  and an increase in revenues from infact  for which we first recognized revenue in the fourth quarter of the decrease in maintenance revenue for  as compared to  is attributable to a decrease in maintenance renewals in the second and third quarters of the increase in maintenance revenue for  as compared to was due to an increase in our installed base and ongoing maintenance renewals 
professional services revenue is generated from consulting and training activities 
the increase in professional services revenue for  as compared to  relates to better utilization of our professional staff resulting from our increased focus on training and consulting  as we updated and broadened the range of training courses and materials and better aligned our consulting services with our core software license products 
the increase in consulting revenue is also partially attributable to the growth in the consulting revenue from the infact segment 
the decrease in service revenue for  as compared to  is primarily due to fewer consulting projects in switzerland and north america and a reduction in our consulting headcount 
revenues by segment and geography we operate in three segments north american data analysis  international data analysis  and north american text analysis and we have international operations primarily in europe and asia 
revenues by segment and geography are as follows year ended december  percent year ended december  percent increase increase revenues in thousands north american data analysis international data analysis north american text analysis total revenues by type as of total revenues north american data analysis international data analysis north american text analysis total the increase in north american data analysis revenues for  as compared to  is due primarily to the increase in training revenues and the increase in sales of our server products s plus server 
north american revenue remained relatively flat between and the increase in international data analysis revenues for both and included the favorable impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of revenues from our international subsidiaries 
the increase in international data analysis revenues for  as compared to  is also attributable to increased revenues from professional services as well as increased software license sales 
the increase in international revenues is related to the streamlining of our european organization in mid  resulting in the creation of direct sales organizations that focus on building relationships with large target accounts 
this initiative allowed us to expand our customer base to drive more deployment and enterprise transactions  incorporating both license sales and services 
the increase in international revenues is also partially attributable to higher sales in the asia pacific region 
the increase in international data analysis revenues for  as compared to  was primarily attributable to positive fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
the increase in north american text analysis revenues in  as compared to  relates to the increase in consulting revenues generated by the infact group in the third and forth quarters of  as we made further progress in validating this relatively new product with sales to intelligence and pharmaceutical customers 
the increase in north american text analysis revenues in  as compared to  is due to the first full year of infact revenues  as we recognized our first revenues from this product in the last quarter of we expect our revenues to grow in  subject to the successful launch of new products and continued worldwide economic recovery  and as we continue to increase our sales and marketing resources 
cost of revenues year ended december  percent year ended december  percent increase decrease decrease cost of revenues in thousands software related professional services and other total cost of revenues as of total revenues software related professional services and other total cost of software related revenue consists of royalties for third party software  product media  product duplication  manuals and maintenance and technical support costs 
the decrease in cost of software related revenues for  as compared to  is due primarily to a reduction in royalty costs resulting from the january acquisition of the copyrights to the software code underlying the s programming language 
the acquisition cost was capitalized and will be amortization over a three year period that began on the acquisition date 
our s programming language related royalty costs in were million 
amortization of the s programming language acquisition cost  which partially offset the reduction in royalty expense  was  during this net decrease in costs associated with the s programming language was partially offset by the increases in direct materials and freight on higher product sales 
the increase in costs of software related revenues in  as compared to  is primarily the result of higher license revenues from products on which the company was obligated to pay royalties 
cost of professional services and other consists primarily of salaries and other labor related costs of employees who provide consulting services and training 
the decline in cost of services for  as compared to  is primarily due to cost saving measures implemented in july as part of a corporate restructuring 
the decrease in costs of professional services at international locations was partially offset by increases resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations  impacting the translation of our foreign subsidiaries costs to us dollars 
the decrease in costs of professional services  as a percentage of revenues  for as compared to  is due to higher utilization rates and billable productivity of our consulting professionals 
the decrease in costs of professional revenues for  as compared to  is primarily due to reduced related headcount in response to the decline in of the demand for those services 
should our revenues grow in  we expect related growth in our costs of revenues 
gross margins will likely fluctuate based primarily on revenue productivity of our consultants  since these costs are relatively fixed in the short term  and based on the mix of our license sales 
operating expenses sales and marketing year ended december  percent year ended december  percent decrease decrease sales and marketing expenses in thousands sales and marketing expenses as percentage of revenues sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  travel  facilities costs for sales and marketing personnel  promotional activities  and costs of advertising and trade shows 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in  as compared to  is due to the reductions in variable costs for marketing related programs  as well as reduced payroll related marketing costs 
the restructuring of our international business in  resulting in the closure of our german office  also contributed to the decline in sales and marketing expenses 
those reductions in were partially offset by the increase in revenue based compensation costs 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses for  as compared to  was primarily due to the closing of our german office in july and reduction in workforce in our swiss office 
in  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase as we recruit and hire additional personnel  including executives  and expand our marketing programs 
research and development  net year ended december  percent increase year ended december  percent decrease decrease research and development in thousands research and development less funded research research and development  net research and development as percentage of revenues research and development less funded research research and development  net net research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits  equipment for software developers  facility costs  and payments to outside contractors  less funded research 
the increase in net research and development costs for  as compared to  reflects primarily the decline in reimbursements from government research grants  as we are refocusing our research and development efforts towards development of technology more closely aligned with our commercial product lines 
the decline in funded research also reflects the use of certain of our text analysis research and development staff in support for our revenues from professional consulting services 
this decline in research reimbursements was partially offset by reductions in payroll related expenses 
the decrease in net research and development costs for  as compared to  was primarily attributable to workforce reductions implemented in july and july the personnel reduction costs saving were somewhat offset by the decline in funded research  which is attributable to the number of awarded contracts as well as to a more focused approach of aligning research funding with our core products 
in  we expect to increase our research and development expenses in order to set the foundation for future growth by investing in core product lines development 
in addition  we expect to see a continued decline in research billings from our data analysis segment as we continue to align their research efforts with our product plans 
general and administrative year ended december  percent year ended december  percent increase increase general and administrative expenses in thousands general and administrative expenses as percentage of revenues general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs associated with finance  accounting  investor relations  legal  compliance  and administration activities 
the increase in general and administrative expenses for  as compared to  is primarily attributable to the additional costs incurred in the second quarter of for our independent investigation of issues related to an allegation by a former employee  as well as due to additional legal costs incurred in the first quarter of in resolving a dispute with lucent technology 
the increase in general and administrative expenses for  as compared to  was attributable to increases in insurance  legal  compliance and audit expenses 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we incur additional costs in connection with the enhanced regulatory and corporate governance requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of goodwill impairment in  we recorded a loss from impairment of  resulting from a write down of the carrying value of goodwill for predict ag  our swiss subsidiary  as computed under fas in  we recorded an additional loss from impairment of  consisting of a  write down of the carrying value of goodwill for predict ag and a  write down of the carrying value of goodwill for sigma plus  our french subsidiary 
the impairment was due to the continued decline in the market for it software and services from the september date of acquisition of predict ag and to our july restructuring  which resulted in the termination of nearly of the headcount in our swiss office 
the impairment was the result of a decrease in the discounted future cash flows from our french and swiss subsidiaries as computed under fas caused by a reduction in our revenue growth expectations based on our economic outlook for that region 
restructuring related charges in july and july  we implemented workforce reductions in order to better align our costs with our revenues 
the restructuring expense totaled  and resulted from a workforce reduction of employees  or of our employee base at the time 
of the  restructuring charge   related to our international data analysis segment and the remaining  was attributable to our domestic data analysis segment 
all of the restructuring charges related to employee severance and termination benefits 
those benefits were fully paid during and the restructuring expense totaled  and included a workforce reduction of employees  or of our employee base at the time 
of the  restructuring charge   related to our international data analysis segment and the remaining  was attributable to our domestic data analysis segment 
as part of this restructuring  the company combined its german operations with its swiss subsidiary headquartered in basel  switzerland 
on september   shawn javid  president and ceo  resigned from the company 
the restructuring charges  including charges associated with the resignation of shawn javid  consisted primarily of employee severance and termination payments and lease termination costs  as well as a  non cash compensation charge related to a modification of stock options upon termination of mr 
javid 
as of december    in termination benefits remained to be paid  of which  were paid in and the remaining  in other income and interest expense total other income  consisting primarily of foreign exchange transaction gains and losses as well as interest income  increased from  in to  in total other income increased from  in to  in the increases in other income for both periods primarily reflect the impact of the us dollar rate decline on us denominated intercompany amounts due from our international subsidiaries to the us parent company 
the increase in other income is also partially the result in the increase in invested cash balances and the related rate of return on those investments in the corresponding periods 
interest expense increased from  in to  in interest expense decreased from  in to  in the fluctuations in the expense reflect the fluctuations in the interest rates and the changes in the total amount of borrowings 
income taxes as of december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and research and development and other tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
utilization of net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to certain limitations under section of the internal revenue code 
deferred tax assets  which have arisen primarily as a result of these net operating losses and other tax credits also reflect the effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the corresponding financial statement amounts 
due to the uncertainty of our ability to utilize its deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance has been established for financial reporting purposes equal to the amount of the net deferred tax assets 
in the future  we will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets based on whether the facts and circumstances at the time indicate it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will ultimately be utilized 
the income tax benefit of  in and the income tax benefit of  in primarily relate to changes in estimates of tax obligations relating to our foreign subsidiaries 
income tax expense of  in reflects the provision for foreign income taxes associated with our international operations 
discontinued operations on january  we sold the assets of our engineering and education products division  or eepd  for cash proceeds of  as a result of this transaction  we recorded the operations of eepd as discontinued operations 
we recorded a net gain of  on the sale in after taking into account net assets transferred and certain liabilities arising from the transaction including severance and transaction costs 
the liabilities arising from the sale included accruals related to certain contingencies resulting from the disposition 
in  these contingencies were favorably resolved resulting in a net gain of  also recorded as a gain on disposal of discontinued operations 
during  we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of  related to previously unidentified potential third party contractual commitments of eepd 
the amounts were not material to the periods in which they applied  primarily and liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased from million at december  to million at december  our working capital increased from million at december  to million at december  we generated million in cash from operating activities for compared to million generated from operating activities in the increase in operating cash inflows primarily relates to an increase in profitability  partially offset by the increases in net working capital components  other than cash 
the difference between our net income loss from continuing operations and our operating cash inflows is attributable to non cash expenses included in net income loss  and changes in operating assets and liabilities  as presented below in thousands year ended december  net income loss from continuing operations add non cash expenses deduct changes in operating assets and liabilities net cash provided by used in operating activities non cash expenses are associated with the amortization of intangible assets  including purchased technology  depreciation and amortization of property and equipment  and stock based compensation charges 
in  non cash expenses also reflected goodwill impairment charges 
changes in operating assets and liabilities reflect changes in working capital components of the balance sheet apart from cash and short term investments 
investing activities resulted in net cash outflows of million for compared to million for the increase in cash outflows from investing activities primarily relates to the purchase of the s programming language from lucent technologies  as well as higher levels of purchases of property and equipment 
financing activities resulted in net cash inflows of million for compared to net cash outflows of  for the increase in cash inflows from financing activities relates to our receipt of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and contributions to our employee stock purchase plan 
in march  we renewed a working capital revolving line of credit and security agreement with silicon valley bank and modified the terms to provide for up to million in borrowing availability through march  this facility was secured by our accounts receivable and allowed us to borrow up to the lesser of of eligible accounts receivable or million and bears interest at the prime rate  which was as of december   plus 
at december   no amounts had been borrowed and million was available for future borrowings under the line of credit facility 
at december   we also had an outstanding balance on the equipment loan with silicon valley bank  secured by the underlying assets 
we borrowed  under this facility in and the remaining outstanding balance was  at december  this loan bears interest at the prime rate plus and is being repaid over a month period  ending in march of on march   we renewed our credit facility for another year with silicon valley bank on substantially the same terms as the prior credit line and term loan agreement 
these credit facilities contain covenants that limit our net losses and restrict the amount of capital expenditures not financed through the equipment term loan 
in addition  we are prohibited under these facilities from paying dividends 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  at december   our principal unused sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of million and our bank line of credit 
our liquidity needs are principally for financing of accounts receivable  capital assets  strategic investments  product development  and flexibility in a dynamic and competitive operating environment 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and available bank borrowings will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  if during that time  we choose to increase our investment in current or new product and marketing initiatives  market conditions worsen  or if other unforeseen events should occur  we could deem it necessary to seek additional funds through public or private equity financing or from other sources in order to fund our operations and pursue our growth strategy 
financing we would obtain  if any  may contain covenants that restrict our freedom to operate our business or may require us to issue securities that have rights  preferences or privileges senior to our common stock and may dilute stockholder ownership interest in insightful 
commitments as of december   our contractual commitments associated with our operating leases  primarily for our office space in seattle  washington  as well as other domestic and international locations  and equipment financing are as follows in thousands thereafter total operating lease obligations equipment term loan total off balance sheet arrangements we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products 
we evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under sfas  accounting for contingencies  as interpreted by fin we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
to date  we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  that requires companies to expense the value of employee stock options  discounts on employee stock purchase plans and similar awards 
under sfas r  share based payment awards result in a cost that will be measured at fair value on the awards grant date  based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest 
sfas r applies to all outstanding and unvested share based payment awards at the adoption date 
for public companies that do not file as small business issuers  sfas r is effective for periods beginning after june  our third quarter of 
for public companies that do file as small business issuers  sfas r is effective for periods beginning after december  our first quarter of 
we expect to file as a small business issuer in  however  we have not yet made the determination as to whether we will adopt the provisions of sfas r earlier than required 
when we do adopt the new standard  we will do so using the modified prospective transition method which permits recognition of expense on or after the effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered 
the adoption of sfas r will result in additional expense being recorded in future years related to our share based employee compensation programs 
we have not completed our evaluation of the financial statements impact of adopting sfas r 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in the united states and sell them worldwide 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
we operate in the united kingdom  germany  france and switzerland and incur expenses and generate billings denominated in those local currencies 
interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since our investments are in short term instruments 
based on the short term nature and current levels of our investments and debt  however  we do not believe that there is any material market risk or exposure to our cash flows 
our general investing policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting credit and market risk 
we currently invest in highly liquid money market accounts 
all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents
