item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in item of this annual report on form k 
results of operations the company s business is cyclical and is affected by the same economic factors that affect the remodeling and housing industries in general  including the availability of credit  consumer confidence  changes in interest rates  market demand and general economic conditions 
in addition to external economic factors  the company s results are sensitive to sales and manufacturing volume  competitors pricing  consumer preferences for flooring products  raw material costs and the mix of products sold 
the manufacturing process is capital intensive and requires substantial investment in facilities and equipment 
the cost of operating these facilities generally does not vary in direct proportion to production volume and  consequently  operating results fluctuate disproportionately with changes in sales volume 
on december   congoleum filed a voluntary petition with the united states bankruptcy court for the district of new jersey case no 
seeking relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code as a means to resolve claims asserted against it related to the use of asbestos in its products decades ago 
during  congoleum obtained the requisite votes of asbestos personal injury claimants necessary to seek approval of a proposed  pre packaged chapter plan of reorganization 
in january  the company filed its proposed plan of reorganization and disclosure statement with the bankruptcy court 
on november   congoleum filed a modified plan of reorganization and related documents with the bankruptcy court reflecting the result of further negotiations with representatives of the asbestos claimants committee  the future claimants representative and other asbestos claimant representatives 
the bankruptcy court approved the disclosure statement and plan voting procedures on december  and has scheduled a hearing to begin on april  to consider confirmation of the plan 
the company has solicited and received the acceptances necessary for confirmation of its plan 
however  there can be no assurance that the confirmation hearing will not be rescheduled to a later date  or that the proposed plan of reorganization will not be modified further or that the bankruptcy court will approve the plan 
congoleum is presently involved in litigation with certain insurance carriers related to disputed insurance coverage for asbestos related liabilities  and certain insurance carriers filed various objections to congoleum s previously proposed plan of reorganization and related matters 
there can be no assurances that these or other insurance carriers will not file objections to the recently filed modified plan of reorganization 
certain other parties have also filed various objections to congoleum s plan of reorganization 
the proposed modified plan of reorganization  if confirmed  would leave non asbestos creditors unimpaired and would resolve all pending and future asbestos claims against the company 
the proposed modified plan of reorganization would provide  among other things  for an assignment of certain rights in  and proceeds of  congoleum s applicable insurance to a trust the plan trust that would fund the settlement of all pending and future asbestos claims and protect the company from future asbestos related claims and litigation by channeling all asbestos claims to the plan trust pursuant to the provisions of section g of the bankruptcy code 
other creditors would be unimpaired under the plan 
the company anticipates that it will take until the third quarter of to obtain confirmation of its proposed plan of reorganization 
there can be no assurance that the proposed plan will not be modified again  or that a confirmation order  if entered  will not be appealed 
in anticipation of congoleum s commencement of the chapter cases  congoleum entered into a settlement agreement with various asbestos personal injury claimants the claimant agreement  which provides for an aggregate settlement value of at least million 
as contemplated by the claimant agreement  congoleum also entered into agreements establishing a pre petition trust the collateral trust to distribute funds in accordance with the terms of the claimant agreement and granting the collateral trust a security interest in its rights under applicable insurance coverage and payments from insurers for asbestos claims 
under congoleum s proposed plan of reorganization  after the establishment of the trust to be established upon confirmation of the plan of reorganization  the assets in the collateral trust would be transferred to the plan trust 
the company expects that any claims subject to the claimant agreement that are unsatisfied as of the confirmation of the plan of reorganization by the bankruptcy court would be channeled to the plan trust 
based on its proposed plan of reorganization  the company has made provisions in its financial statements for the minimum amount of the range of estimates for its contribution to the plans trust and costs to effect the proposed plan to settle asbestos liabilities through a plan trust established pursuant to the provisions of section g of the bankruptcy code 
the company recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of  an additional million in the fourth quarter of  and a further million in the fourth quarter of to provide for the estimated minimum costs of completing its reorganization 
actual amounts that will be contributed to the plan trust and costs for pursuing and implementing the plan of reorganization could be materially higher  and the company may record significant additional charges should the minimum estimated cost increase 
for more information regarding the company s asbestos liability and plan for resolving that liability  please refer to notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k 
in addition  please refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors that may affect future results the company has significant asbestos liability and funding exposure  and its proposed amended plan of reorganization may not be confirmed for a discussion of certain factors that could cause actual results to differ from the company s goals for resolving its asbestos liability through the proposed plan of reorganization 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  totaled million as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in sales resulted from improvements in residential sheet sales reflecting the introduction in the second half of of a new high end product  xclusive  continued improvements in sales of the duraceramic tile product  higher shipments to the manufactured housing industry  and the effect of a price increase 
partially offsetting these improvements were declines in do it yourself tile sales to mass merchandisers  lower durastone product sales and less demand for residential sheet specials 
gross profit for the year ended december  totaled million  or of net sales  compared to million or of net sales for the year ended december  the increase in gross margins were driven by improvement in product mix  particularly residential sheet  coupled with improved manufacturing efficiencies and the impact of cost reduction programs initiated in the second half of these factors helped offset sharply higher raw material costs experienced during the second half of the year 
the significant raw material inflation experienced in is expected to continue into  and will reduce profit margins to the extent it cannot be recovered through price increases 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses for and included million and million  respectively  of costs associated with asbestos related reorganization claims 
as a percent of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the lower selling  general and administrative expenses reflect the impact of several cost savings initiatives instituted in the second half of  including workforce reductions  reduced merchandising and sampling expenses  and elimination of trade shows 
these initiatives  coupled with further cost reduction steps taken in the fall of  helped offset increased costs in healthcare  pensions and performance related incentive fees 
the company recorded a charge of million during the fourth quarter of  included in selling  general  and administrative expenses  to increase its estimated recorded liability for resolving asbestos related claims 
the recorded liability at december  represents the minimum estimated cost that the company would incur to resolve its asbestos related liability through the execution of the company s proposed plan of reorganization 
if the company is not successful in obtaining confirmation of its proposed plan of reorganization in a timely manner  actual costs could be significantly higher 
the proposed plan also would require the company to make an additional contribution to the plan trust one year after confirmation of the plan equal to of any increase in market value of the company s shares at that time over their value on june  for example  if the adjustment amount were calculated for the period ended december   the resulting adjustment amount would be million 
no provision has been made for the cost of this possible additional contribution  which could be material 
the company will adjust its recorded liability should its estimates change 
in addition  it is expected that the terms of the note will require the company to make interest payments prior to such note s maturity date 
income from operations was million for the year ended december  compared to a loss of million for the same period in the prior year  an improvement of million 
this improvement in operating income reflects higher sales and margins coupled with reductions in operating expenses 
interest income was unchanged at million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest expense increased from million in to million in  primarily reflecting the accrued interest on unpaid senior note interest 
due to the chapter proceedings  the company was precluded from making the interest payments due february  and august  on the senior notes 
the company recorded a tax benefit of million on income before taxes of million in this relates primarily to anticipated tax benefits associated with certain prior year expenditures for resolving asbestos related liabilities  which the company has determined may be carried back but were not previously recognized 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease resulted primarily from lower sales in the do it yourself tile category coupled with continued weakness in the manufactured housing market 
improved resilient sheet volume  particularly in base grade and trade up builder products  coupled with a price increase and lower sales allowances  helped to partially mitigate the sales decline 
gross profit for the year ended december  totaled million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  gross margins improved slightly as improved pricing  manufacturing efficiencies and cost reduction programs helped offset raw material cost increases 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses for and included million and million of cost associated with asbestos related claims  respectively 
as a percent of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during  cost savings initiatives were implemented that helped offset increases in pension  medical and other related costs 
the company recorded a charge of million during the fourth quarter of  included in selling  general  and administrative expenses  to increase its recorded liability for resolving asbestos related claims to the then estimated minimum cost to resolve its asbestos related liability through the execution of its proposed plan of reorganization 
the loss from operations was million for the year ended december  compared to a loss of million for the year ended december   an improvement of million 
this smaller loss from operations was primarily due to the lower asbestos related charge  offset by lower gross margin dollars 
interest income declined from million in to million in due to lower average cash equivalent and short term investment balances 
interest expense increased from million in to million in  reflecting increased borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement 
the company recorded a tax benefit of million on a loss before income taxes of million in as a result of utilizing certain loss carry forwards that had previously been fully reserved 
liquidity and capital resources the consolidated financial statements of the company have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
accordingly  the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern 
as described more fully in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k  there is substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern unless it obtains relief from its substantial asbestos liabilities through a successful reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
the company is a defendant in a large number of asbestos related lawsuits and on december  filed a pre packaged plan of reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code as part of its strategy to resolve this liability 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  which are contained in item of this annual report on form k 
these matters will have a material adverse impact on liquidity and capital resources 
during  the company paid million in fees and expenses related to implementation of its planned reorganization under chapter and litigation with certain insurance companies 
pursuant to terms of the claimant agreement and related documents  congoleum is entitled to reimbursement for certain expenses it incurs for claims processing costs and expenses in connection with pursuit of insurance coverage 
at december   congoleum had million recorded as a receivable for such reimbursements 
the amount and timing of reimbursements that will be received will depend on when the trust receives funds from insurance settlements or other sources and whether the insurance proceeds exceed million  which is the required threshold for reimbursement of the first million spent by congoleum 
congoleum believes this threshold will be met  although there can be no assurances to that effect 
congoleum expects to spend a further million at a minimum in fees  expenses  and trust contributions in connection with obtaining confirmation of its plan  which amount is recorded in its reserve for asbestos related liabilities in addition to the million insurance settlement being held as restricted cash 
it also expects to spend a further million during in connection with pursuit of insurance coverage  for which it expects to be reimbursed as discussed above 
as part of the company s proposed plan of reorganization  congoleum will also issue a promissory note to the plan trust 
under the terms of the proposed plan  the original principal amount of the company note will be million and will be subject to increase as of the last trading day of the consecutive trading day period commencing on the first anniversary of the effective date of the company s plan of reorganization in an amount equal to the excess  if any  of the amount by which of the company s market capitalization as of that date exceeds million 
this adjustment amount could result in the principal amount of the note increasing materially 
for example  if the adjustment amount were calculated for the period ended december   the resulting adjustment amount would be million 
although the scheduled repayment date for this note does not occur until its tenth anniversary of issuance  this debt may affect congoleum s ability to obtain other sources of financing or refinance existing obligations 
in addition  it is expected that the terms of the note will require the company to make interest payments prior to such note s maturity date 
the proposed plan and collateral trust agreement agreement related to the collateral trust  as modified  would obligate congoleum  together with the plan trust  to indemnify certain asbestos claimant representatives for all costs and liabilities including attorneys fees relating to the negotiation of the modification of the plan and the collateral trust 
congoleum s indemnification obligations in this regard are capped under the modified plan and plan trust agreement at million 
in addition  the plan would further obligate congoleum to fund any actual costs in excess of million incurred by such asbestos claimant representatives in connection with the confirmation of the plan  subject to bankruptcy court approval of those costs 
unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  including short term investments at december   were million  an increase of million from december  the increase includes accrued but unpaid interest during of million 
under the terms of its revolving credit agreement  payments on the company s accounts receivable are deposited in an account assigned by the company to its lender and the funds in that account are used by the lender to pay down any loan balance 
funds deposited in this account but not yet applied to the loan balance  which amounted to million and million at december  and december   respectively  are recorded as restricted cash 
additionally  a million settlement received in august from an insurance carrier  which is subject to the lien of the collateral trust  is included as restricted cash at december  the company expects to contribute these funds  less any amounts withheld pursuant to reimbursement arrangements  to the trust formed upon confirmation of its plan of reorganization 
working capital was million at december   up from million one year earlier 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities at december  was to  compared to to at december  the ratio of debt to total capital at december  was to compared to to at december  net cash provided by operations during the year ended december  was million  as compared to net cash used by operations of million in net cash from operations increased from to due to improved operating results  resumption of normal trade credit which had contracted at the end of  non payment of interest on the company s senior notes while operating under chapter  and improved inventory management 
capital expenditures in totaled million 
the company is currently planning capital expenditures of approximately million in and between million and million in  primarily for maintenance and improvement of plants and equipment  which it expects to fund with cash from operations and credit facilities 
in january  the bankruptcy court authorized entry of a final order approving congoleum s debtor in possession financing  which replaced its pre petition credit facility on substantially similar terms 
the debtor in possession financing agreement as amended and approved by the bankruptcy court to date provides a revolving credit facility expiring on june  with borrowings up to million 
interest is based on above the prime rate 
this financing agreement contains certain covenants  which include the maintenance of a minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
it also includes restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt and limitations on capital expenditures 
the covenants and conditions under this financing agreement must be met in order for the company to borrow from the facility 
the company was in compliance with these covenants at december  borrowings under this facility are collateralized by inventory and receivables 
at december   based on the level of receivables and inventory  million was available under the facility  of which million was utilized for outstanding letters of credit and million was utilized by the revolving loan 
the company anticipates that its debtor in possession financing facility will be replaced with a revolving credit facility on substantially similar terms upon confirmation of its plan of reorganization 
while the company expects the facilities discussed above will provide it with sufficient liquidity  there can be no assurances that it will continue to be in compliance with the required covenants  that the company will be able to obtain a similar or sufficient facility upon exit from bankruptcy  or that the debtor in possession facility would be renewed if the company s plan of reorganization is not confirmed by that facility s expiration on june  in addition to the provision for asbestos litigation discussed previously  the company has also recorded what it believes are adequate provisions for environmental remediation and product related liabilities other than asbestos related claims  including provisions for testing for potential remediation of conditions at its own facilities 
the company is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations and certain legal and administrative claims are pending or have been asserted against the company 
among these claims  the company is a named party in several actions associated with waste disposal sites more fully discussed in legal proceedings in part i  item and environmental regulation in part i  item 
these actions include possible obligations to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of wastes deposited at various sites  including superfund sites and certain of the company s owned and previously owned facilities 
the contingencies also include claims for personal injury and or property damage 
the exact amount of such future cost and timing of payments are indeterminable due to such unknown factors as the magnitude of cleanup costs  the timing and extent of the remedial actions that may be required  the determination of the company s liability in proportion to other potentially responsible parties  and the extent to which costs may be recoverable from insurance 
the company has recorded provisions in its financial statements for the estimated probable loss associated with all known general and environmental contingencies 
while the company believes its estimate of the future amount of these liabilities is reasonable  and that they will be paid over a period of five to ten years  the timing and amount of such payments may differ significantly from the company s assumptions 
although the effect of future government regulation could have a significant effect on the company s costs  the company is not aware of any pending legislation which would reasonably have such an effect 
there can be no assurances that the costs of any future government regulations could be passed along to its customers 
estimated insurance recoveries related to these liabilities are reflected in other non current assets 
the outcome of these environmental matters could result in significant expenses incurred by or judgments assessed against the company 
the company s principal sources of capital are net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under its financing agreement 
the company generated million in cash from operations in as more fully discussed above  which includes million of accrued but unpaid interest on long term debt 
the company believes these sources will be adequate to fund working capital requirements  debt service payments  planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future  and its current estimates for costs to settle and resolve its asbestos liabilities through its proposed chapter plan of reorganization 
the company s inability to obtain confirmation of the proposed plan of reorganization in a timely manner would have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to fund its operating  investing and financing requirements 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations for future principal payments on its debt and future minimum rental payments on its non cancelable operating leases at december  the company does not have payment obligations under capital leases or long term purchase contracts 
payments due by period amounts in thousands total less than year years years after years long term debt   operating leases     total     critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that entail significant judgments and estimates  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes its most critical accounting policies upon which its financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments  are those described below 
for a discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k 
asbestos liabilities as discussed in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company is a party to a significant number of lawsuits stemming from its manufacture of asbestos containing products 
during  congoleum obtained the asbestos personal injury claimant votes necessary for approval of a proposed pre packaged chapter plan of reorganization  and  in january  filed its pre packaged plan of reorganization and disclosure statement with the bankruptcy court 
on november   congoleum filed a modified plan of reorganization and related documents with the bankruptcy court reflecting the result of further negotiations with representatives of the asbestos claimants committee  the future claimants representative and other asbestos claimant representatives 
the bankruptcy court approved the disclosure statement and plan voting procedures on december  the bankruptcy court has scheduled a hearing to begin on april  to consider approval of the proposed plan 
congoleum is also involved in litigation with certain insurance carriers related to disputed insurance coverage for asbestos related liabilities  and certain insurance carriers have filed various objections to congoleum s plan of reorganization and related matters 
the company s estimated minimum gross liability to cover settlements of current asbestos claims is million  which is substantially in excess of both the total assets of the company as well as the company s previous estimates made in prior periods of the maximum liability for both known and unasserted claims 
while the company purchased insurance coverage it believes applies to these claims  some of the insurance carriers are presently insolvent and the remaining solvent insurance carriers have disputed their coverage obligations 
the company believes the ultimate amount of its liability  and the amount of recoverable insurance  will be determined through some combination of negotiation  litigation  and bankruptcy court order  but that these amounts cannot be reasonably estimated given all the uncertainties that presently exist 
the company expects that insurance will provide the vast majority of the recovery available to claimants  due to the amount of insurance coverage it purchased and the comparatively limited resources and value of the company itself 
the company does not have the necessary financial resources to litigate and or settle asbestos claims in the ordinary course of business 
in light of its bankruptcy filing and proposed plan of reorganization  the company believes the most meaningful measure of its probable loss due to asbestos litigation is the amount it will have to contribute to the plan trust plus the costs to effect the reorganization 
the company estimates the minimum remaining costs to complete the reorganization process to be million  of which it has recorded million as a current liability and million as a long term liability representing the minimum estimated amount of the note to be contributed to the plan trust 
these amounts do not include the liability associated with a million insurance settlement recorded as restricted cash which the company expects to contribute  less any amounts withheld pursuant to reimbursement arrangements  to the plan trust formed upon confirmation of its plan of reorganization 
the company also expects to recover million from insurance proceeds or the collateral trust or its successor pursuant to terms of the claimant agreement and related documents which provide for the plan trust to reimburse certain expenses of the company 
the amount and timing of reimbursements that will be received will depend on when the trust receives funds from insurance settlements or other sources and whether the insurance proceeds exceed million  which is the required threshold for reimbursement of the first million spent by congoleum 
congoleum believes this threshold will be met  although there can be no assurances to that effect 
the maximum amount of the range of possible asbestos loss is limited to the going concern or liquidation value of the company  an amount which the company believes is substantially less than the minimum estimated liability for the known claims against it 
the company will update its estimates  if appropriate  as additional information becomes available during the reorganization process  which could result in potentially material adjustments to the company s earnings in future periods 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the lifo last in  first out method of determining cost is used for substantially all inventories 
the company records as a charge to cost of goods sold any amount required to reduce the carrying value of inventories to the net realizable sales value 
valuation of deferred tax assets the company provides for valuation reserves against its deferred tax assets in accordance with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
in evaluating the recovery of deferred tax assets  the company makes certain assumptions as to future events such as the ability to generate future taxable income 
at december   the company has provided a valuation allowance for its net deferred tax assets 
environmental contingencies the company has incurred liabilities related to environmental remediation costs at both third party sites and company owned sites 
management has recorded both liabilities and insurance receivables in its financial statements for its estimate of costs and insurance recoveries for future remediation activities 
these estimates are based on certain assumptions such as the extent of cleanup activities to be performed  the methods employed in the cleanup activities  the company s relative share in costs at sites where other parties are involved  and the ultimate insurance coverage available 
these projects tend to be long term in nature  and these assumptions are subject to refinement as facts change 
as such  it is possible that the company may need to revise its recorded liabilities and receivables for environmental costs in future periods resulting in potentially material adjustments to the company s earnings in future periods 
pension plans and post retirement benefits the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
as permitted by sfas no 
 the company uses a calculated value of the expected return on plan assets which is further described below 
under sfas no 
 the effects of the actual performance of the pension plan s assets and changes in pension liability discount rates on the company s computation of pension income or expense are amortized over future periods 
the most significant element in determining the company s pension income or expense in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets 
for  the company has assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to the value of plan assets 
which produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in determining pension expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past actuarial gains or losses million loss at december  will ultimately be recognized as an adjustment to future pension expense 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   the company determined this rate to be 
the company accounts for its post retirement benefits other than pensions in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on a actuarial basis 
these amounts are projected based on the january  sfas no 
valuation and the year end disclosure assumptions  including a discount rate of and health care cost trend rates of in reducing to an ultimate rate of in risk factors that may affect future results the company has significant asbestos liability and funding exposure  and its proposed amended plan of reorganization may not be confirmed 
as more fully set forth in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  which are included in this annual report on form k  the company has significant liability and funding exposure for asbestos claims 
the company has entered into settlement agreements with various asbestos claimants totaling million 
satisfaction of this obligation pursuant to the terms of the amended plan of reorganization is dependent on a determination by the bankruptcy court that the plan has satisfied certain criteria under the bankruptcy code  among other things 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining confirmation of its amended plan of reorganization in a timely manner or at all  and any alternative plan of reorganization pursued by the company or confirmed by the bankruptcy court could vary significantly from the description set forth in this annual report on form k 
furthermore  the estimated costs and contributions to effect the contemplated plan of reorganization or an alternative plan could be significantly greater than currently estimated 
any plan of reorganization pursued by the company will be subject to numerous conditions  approvals and other requirements  including bankruptcy court approvals  and there can be no assurance that such conditions  approvals and other requirements will be satisfied or obtained 
some additional factors that could cause actual results to differ from the company s goals for resolving its asbestos liability through the amended plan of reorganization bankruptcy filing include i the future cost and timing of estimated asbestos liabilities and payments and availability of insurance coverage and reimbursement from insurance companies  which underwrote the applicable insurance policies for the company for asbestos related claims and other costs relating to the execution and implementation of any plan of reorganization pursued by the company  ii timely reaching agreement with other creditors  or classes of creditors  that exist or may emerge  iii satisfaction of the conditions and obligations under the company s outstanding debt instruments  iv the response from time to time of the company s and its controlling shareholder s  american biltrite inc s  lenders  customers  suppliers and other constituencies to the ongoing process arising from the company s strategy to settle its asbestos liability  v the company s ability to maintain debtor in possession financing sufficient to provide it with funding that may be needed during the pendency of its chapter case and to obtain exit financing sufficient to provide it with funding that may be needed for its operations after emerging from the bankruptcy process  in each case  on reasonable terms  vi timely obtaining sufficient creditor and court approval of any reorganization plan pursued by it  vii developments in and the outcome of insurance coverage litigation pending in new jersey state court involving congoleum and certain insurers  and viii compliance with the bankruptcy code  including section g 
in any event  if the company is not successful in obtaining sufficient creditor and court approval of its amended plan of reorganization  such failure would have a material adverse effect upon its business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  there has been federal legislation proposed that  if adopted  would establish a national trust to provide compensation to victims of asbestos related injuries and channel all current and future asbestos related personal injury claims to that trust 
due to the uncertainties involved with the pending legislation  the company does not know what effects any such legislation  if adopted  may have upon its business  results of operations or financial condition  or upon any plan of reorganization it may decide to pursue 
to date  the company has expended significant amounts pursuant to resolving its asbestos liability relating to its proposed amended chapter plan of reorganization 
to the extent any federal legislation is enacted  which does not credit the company for amounts paid by the company pursuant to its plan of reorganization or requires the company to pay significant amounts to any national trust or otherwise  such legislation could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
as a result of the company s significant liability and funding exposure for asbestos claims  there can be no assurance that if it were to incur any unforecasted or unexpected liability or disruption to its business or operations it would be able to withstand that liability or disruption and continue as an operating company 
for further information regarding the company s asbestos liability  insurance coverage and strategy to resolve its asbestos liability  please see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements  which are included in this annual report on form k 
the company may incur substantial liability for environmental  product and general liability claims in addition to asbestos related claims  and its insurance coverage and its likely recoverable insurance proceeds may be substantially less than the liability incurred by the company for these claims 
environmental liabilities 
due to the nature of the company s business and certain of the substances which are or have been used  produced or discharged by the company  the company s operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation  storage  disposal  handling  emission  transportation and discharge into the environment of hazardous substances 
the company has historically expended substantial amounts for compliance with existing environmental laws or regulations  including environmental remediation costs at both third party sites and company owned sites 
the company will continue to be required to expend amounts in the future for costs related to prior activities at its facilities and third party sites  and for ongoing costs to comply with existing environmental laws  such amounts may be substantial 
there is no certainty that these amounts will not have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations and financial condition because  as a result of environmental requirements becoming increasingly strict  the company is unable to determine the ultimate cost of compliance with environmental laws and enforcement policies 
moreover  in addition to potentially having to pay substantial amounts for compliance  future environmental laws or regulations may require or cause the company to modify or curtail its operations  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
product and general liabilities 
in the ordinary course of its business  the company becomes involved in lawsuits  administrative proceedings  product liability claims in addition to asbestos related claims and other matters 
in some of these proceedings  plaintiffs may seek to recover large and sometimes unspecified amounts and the matters may remain unresolved for several years 
these matters could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition if the company is unable to successfully defend against or settle these matters  its insurance coverage is insufficient to satisfy unfavorable judgments or settlements relating to these matters  or the company is unable to collect insurance proceeds relating to these matters 
the company is dependent upon a continuous supply of raw materials from third party suppliers and would be harmed if there were a significant  prolonged disruption in supply or increase in its raw material costs 
the company s business is dependent upon a continuous supply of raw materials from third party suppliers 
the principal raw materials used by the company in its manufacture of sheet and tile flooring are vinyl resins  plasticizers  latex  limestone  stabilizers  cellulose paper fibers  urethane and transfer print paper 
the company purchases most of these raw materials from multiple sources 
although the company has generally not had difficulty in obtaining its requirements for these materials  it has occasionally experienced significant price increases for some of these materials 
raw material prices in increased significantly  and recent industry supply conditions for specialty resins used in flooring have been very tight  despite significant price increases  in part due to an explosion at a large resin plant in that destroyed the plant 
although the company has not experienced any significant difficulties obtaining specialty resin  there can be no assurances that it may not have difficulty in the future  particularly if global supply conditions deteriorate 
the company believes that suitable alternative suppliers are available for substantially all of its raw material requirements 
however  the company does not have readily available alternative sources of supply for specific designs of transfer print paper  which are produced utilizing print cylinders engraved to the company s specifications 
although no loss of this source of supply is anticipated  replacement could take a considerable period of time and interrupt production of some of the company s products 
in an attempt to protect against this risk of loss of supply  the company maintains a raw material inventory and continually seeks to develop new sources which will provide continuity of supply for its raw material requirements 
however  there is no certainty that the company s maintenance of its raw material inventory or its ongoing efforts to develop new sources of supply would be successful in avoiding a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations and financial condition if it were to realize an extended interruption in the supply of its raw materials
