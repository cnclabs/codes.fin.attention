overview all of the operations of airtran holdings  inc are conducted by our wholly owned subsidiary  airtran airways  inc airways 
airways is one of the largest low fare scheduled airlines in the united states in terms of departures and seats offered 
we operate scheduled airline service mainly in short haul markets principally in the eastern united states  primarily from our hub in atlanta  georgia 
as of march   we operated boeing b aircraft and boeing b aircraft making approximately scheduled flights per day to airports across the united states  serving more than communities in states  the district of columbia and the bahamas 
our plans for focus on continuing the growth of our operations 
we intend to do this by adding thirteen new boeing b and six new b aircraft to our fleet  keeping our unit costs at levels that rank among the best in the industry  looking for new market opportunities that will satisfy the transportation needs of our customers  and providing our customers with a travel experience worth repeating 
we expect our mix of low fares  excellent customer service  an affordable business class product  and one of the youngest all boeing aircraft fleets will equip us with the assets necessary to accomplish our plans for the upcoming year 

table of contents year in review we concluded the year as one of only a few domestic passenger airlines to report profitable operations for the entire year 
although our financial results for were adversely affected by  among other things  record high fuel prices  four hurricanes in florida and intense price competition by both long time competitors and new entrants into the markets we serve  we reported net income of million for the year 
our business model is based upon low costs and our success in reducing costs has ensured our ability to persevere through the difficult economic environment we have faced  not only during but also during the immediately prior years as well 
our low costs have also given us the strategic advantage that allows us to grow while many of our competitors have been unable to do the same 
many of our competitors have incurred substantial losses in and are attempting to restructure their operations  gain wage concessions from their employees and lower their costs  including filing for bankruptcy protection and  in some instances  by attempting to emulate aspects of our business model 
during  we continued to execute key components of our business plans 
we completed our fleet renewal plan by retiring the last of our dc aircraft and replacing them with new bs  and also began taking delivery of new b aircraft 
these new b aircraft have expanded our operations to new destinations that previously were unreachable with our other aircraft types while maintaining our low cost advantage over our competitors 
in fact  during the fourth quarter of we recorded our lowest non fuel unit costs in the history of the company and we believe this result is due in part to the introduction of the new bs to our operations 
other highlights from include the following opened a new aircraft hangar at hartsfield jackson atlanta international airport opened a new metro atlanta call center in carrollton  ga 
named best low fare airline by entrepreneur magazine for opened a new pilot training center in atlanta secured financing and leasing commitments for all aircraft deliveries although we were able generally to offset the increased level of operating expenses in with lower maintenance and distribution costs  there can be no assurance we will be able to continue to offset any additional expenses  particularly resulting from increases in the price of fuel  further changes to security procedures or increases in aircraft insurance costs 
results of operations compared to summary our performance during marked a major financial milestone we surpassed one billion dollars in total revenues for the year 
for the year we recorded operating income of million  net income of million and diluted earnings per common share of 
these results reflect a million net credit primarily related to our unsuccessful bid for certain leased gates and other assets of another airline at chicago s midway airport 
our diluted earnings per common share were increased by upon recognition of the credit see note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents for the comparative year in we recorded operating income of million  net income of million and diluted earnings per common share of 
these results reflect a credit of million for a payment from the united states government under the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act of wartime act  a charge of million for the write off of debt discount and debt issuance costs due to early payoff of debt and the conversion of debt to equity and a credit of million created by the reversal of a tax valuation allowance 
our diluted earnings per common share were increased by upon recognition of these items see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
operating revenues our operating revenues for the year increased million percent primarily due to an increase in passenger revenues 
the increase in passenger revenues was primarily due to an percent increase in traffic  as measured by revenue passenger miles rpms 
we placed an order with an aircraft manufacturer in for up to aircraft  including options and purchase rights 
during we increased our aircraft fleet by fourteen boeing aircraft and retired one mcdonnell douglas dc aircraft 
as a result  our capacity  as measured by available seat miles asms  increased percent 
our asm growth  combined with our rpm growth of percent decreased our passenger load factor by percentage points to percent 
our average yield per rpm decreased percent to cents 
the reduction in yield resulted from a percent increase in our average passenger trip length  as measured by rpms divided by revenue passengers 
other revenues increased million primarily due to fees earned from our airtran airways branded credit card issued by a third party financial institution  in addition to change and cancellation fees derived from our overall increase in traffic 
operating expenses our operating expenses for the year increased million percent on an available seat mile asm increase of percent 
our financial results are significantly affected by changes in the price we pay for aircraft fuel 
during  we experienced record aircraft fuel prices derived from sharp increases in the cost of crude oil 
in general  our operating expenses are significantly affected by changes in our capacity  as measured by asms 
the following table presents our unit costs  or operating expenses per asm  for and year ended december  percent change salaries  wages and benefits aircraft fuel aircraft rent maintenance  materials and repairs distribution landing fees and other rents aircraft insurance and security services marketing and advertising depreciation and amortization other operating expenses total casm 
table of contents salaries  wages and benefits increased million percent overall or a decrease of percent on a casm basis primarily due to the addition of flight crews and ground support personnel hired to operate and support the growth of our aircraft fleet and new destinations added to our route system  as well as contractual wage increases and higher costs associated with our employee benefit programs 
we employed approximately  employees including approximately  full time equivalents at year end representing roughly a percent increase over the comparative period 
aircraft fuel  including fuel hedging activities  increased million percent overall or an increase of percent on a casm basis 
the cost of aircraft fuel reached then record highs during with our average per gallon cost  including all fees  taxes  and hedging activities increasing percent to cents 
our overall fuel consumption also increased percent primarily due to the growth of our operations 
improvements to our fuel consumption per block hour partially offset our greater fuel consumption and the record price increases 
our fuel consumption improved percent per block hour compared to our fuel performance improvements directly relate to our transition to an aircraft fleet comprised of two aircraft types that are significantly more fuel efficient than the dc s that were replaced 
we retired our last dc aircraft at the beginning of and accepted delivery of fourteen new b and b aircraft during the remainder of the year 
our fixed price fuel contracts and fuel cap contracts reduced our fuel expense by million and million during and  respectively 
aircraft rent increased million percent overall or percent on a casm basis due to a greater percentage of our aircraft fleet being leased 
twelve lease financed aircraft were added to our fleet during we have lease financing commitments in place to accept delivery of fifteen aircraft during the remainder of our deliveries for the year will be purchased pursuant to debt financing commitments in place with select lenders 
maintenance  materials and repairs increased million percent overall or a decrease of percent on a casm basis 
on a block hour basis  maintenance costs decreased percent to approximately per block hour 
as the original manufacturer warranties expire on our b aircraft the maintenance  repair and overhaul of major aircraft engine  parts and components become covered by previously negotiated agreements with faa approved maintenance contractors 
contractually we pay monthly fees based on the level of our operations  generally measured by either the number of flight hours flown or the number of landings 
our increased level of operations during the year and the related costs associated with our maintenance agreements predominantly account for the overall increase in this area 
distribution costs increased million percent overall or a decrease of percent on a casm basis primarily due to the overall growth of passenger revenues derived from travel agency sales 
although total distribution costs have increased  these costs as a percentage of passenger revenues have decreased as more of our passengers have shifted their bookings directly onto our website 
we recognize significant cost savings when our sales are booked directly through our website as opposed to more traditional methods  such as travel agents 
landing fees and other rents increased million percent overall or no variance on a casm basis primarily due to growth in the number of flights we operated  landing fee rate increases  and the leasing of facilities at new destinations that were added to our route network 
aircraft insurance and security services increased million percent overall or a decrease of percent on a casm basis 
the addition of fourteen new aircraft to our fleet during the year increased our total insured hull value and related insurance premiums 

table of contents marketing and advertising increased million percent overall or a decrease of percent on a casm basis primarily reflecting our promotional efforts associated with the development of our new destinations and our efforts to generate demand in all the markets that we serve 
depreciation increased million percent or a decrease of percent on a casm basis 
our significant asset additions during the year were primarily new aircraft 
however  with the exception of two bs  all aircraft additions during the year were lease financed rather than purchased 
other operating expenses increased million percent or a decrease of percent on a casm basis primarily due to added passenger related costs associated with the higher level of operations  contractual costs related to the opening of new destinations and routes  and the costs associated with our reservations system and other automation projects 
non operating expenses other income expense  net increased by million primarily due to the receipt in of a government reimbursement pursuant to the wartime act of million  partially offset by a million charge related to the write off of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs due to the early retirement of debt and of conversion of debt to equity and by a million reduction in in interest expense as a result of having reduced our outstanding debt obligations 
income tax expense at december  and  we had nol carryforwards for income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  that begin to expire in in addition  our amt credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were million at december  and the change in our valuation allowance was approximately million and million during and  respectively 
these changes in the valuation allowance account for the significant change in our effective tax rates and tax expense benefit between and compared to summary for the year  we recorded operating income of million  net income of million and diluted earnings per common share of 
these results reflect a credit of million for a payment from the united states government under the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act of wartime act  a charge of million for the write off of debt discount and debt issuance costs due to early payoff of debt and the conversion of debt to equity and a credit of million created by the reversal of a tax valuation allowance 
our diluted earnings per common share were increased by upon recognition of these items 
for the comparative period in  including special items  we recorded operating income of million  net income of million and diluted earnings per common share of 
our results included a credit of million for a government grant received pursuant to the air transportation safety and system stabilization act stabilization act 
our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december  were increased by upon recognition of the government grant see note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents operating revenues our operating revenues for the year increased million percent primarily due to an increase in passenger revenues 
the increase in passenger revenues was primarily due to a percent increase in traffic  as measured by rpms 
during  we took delivery of b aircraft and retired nine owned dc aircraft and five leased dc aircraft total of dc aircraft 
as a result  our capacity  as measured asms  increased by percent 
when coupled with our rpm growth of percent  our load factor increased percentage points to percent 
while we continued to grow our operations by adding new aircraft to our fleet  new destinations to our route network  and additional frequencies between existing city pairs  we continued to experience a decline in yields during our average yield  as measured by revenue per passenger seat mile  decreased percent to cents per rpm 
the reduction in yield resulted from a percent increase in our average fare to and a percent increase in our average passenger trip length  as measured by rpms divided by revenue passengers  to miles 
this decline in yield  when combined with our percentage point increase in passenger load factor  resulted in a percent increase in passenger unit revenues  or passenger rasm  to cents per asm 
cargo revenues declined million primarily due to reduced levels of mail transported for the us postal service 
in general  the demand for short haul cargo transportation has diminished and we continue to focus our resources on passenger transportation 
operating expenses our operating expenses for the year increased million percent on an asm increase of percent 
this increase is due to operating an average of eight additional aircraft for the entire year and the end of the warranty period on our aircraft engines resulting in increases to maintenance expense 
in general  our operating expenses are significantly affected by changes in our capacity  as measured by asms 
the following table presents our unit costs  or operating expenses per asm  for and year ended december  percent change salaries  wages and benefits aircraft fuel aircraft rent maintenance  materials and repairs distribution landing fees and other rents aircraft insurance and security services marketing and advertising depreciation and amortization other operating expenses total casm 
table of contents salaries  wages and benefits increased million percent overall or an improved percent on a casm basis primarily due to the addition of flight crews and ground support personnel hired to operate and support the growth of our b aircraft fleet and new destinations added to our route system  as well as contractual wage increases and higher costs associated with our employee benefit programs 
we employed approximately  employees including approximately  full time equivalents at year end representing roughly a percent increase over the comparative period 
aircraft fuel  including fuel hedging activities  increased million percent overall or an improved percent on a casm basis 
in  we consumed percent more fuel primarily due to the growth of our operations 
we also experienced increases in the price of aircraft fuel purchases 
improvements to our fuel consumption per block hour partially offset our greater fuel consumption and the price increases 
our average per gallon cost of fuel  including all fees  taxes  and hedging activities increased percent to cents 
our fuel consumption improved percent decreasing to gallons per block hour compared to gallons per block hour in we continue to realize savings from reduced fuel consumption per block hour as we replace the dc aircraft in our operating fleet with b aircraft that are more fuel efficient 
the results of our terminated derivative contracts increased aircraft fuel expense by million and million during and  respectively 
our fixed price fuel contracts and fuel cap contracts reduced our fuel expense by million and million during and  respectively 
aircraft rent increased million percent overall or a decrease of percent on a casm basis due to a greater percentage of our aircraft fleet being leased 
twenty three lease financed b aircraft were added to our fleet during we have lease financing commitments in place to accept delivery of six b aircraft and six b aircraft during maintenance  materials and repairs increased million percent or a decrease of percent on a casm basis 
on a block hour basis  maintenance costs increased percent to approximately per block hour 
prior to  the b aircraft parts and components were under warranty 
during  we commenced payments under previously negotiated agreements covering the maintenance  repair and overhaul of major b aircraft engine  parts and components 
under these agreements  we pay monthly fees based on either the number of flight hours flown or the number of landings made 
under these contracts  maintenance costs are expensed monthly as the aircraft is utilized 
distribution costs increased million percent overall or improved percent on a casm basis 
our improvement in this area  on a casm basis  was primarily due to i a greater percentage of our passenger sales being generated online via our website  and ii savings generated by revisions to our commission structure 
we recognize significant savings when our sales are transacted via our website as opposed to more traditional methods such as through travel agents and global distribution systems 
during  we revised our commission structure to eliminate the standard percent commission for travel agencies 
we continue to offer a percent commission for sales transacted through the travel agent section of our website 
our commission cost savings was partially offset by increased computer reservation system and credit card fees 
the additional transaction volume derived from our growth in revenue passengers generated the escalation in these fees 
landing fees and other rents increased million percent or a decrease of percent on a casm basis reflecting landing fee rate increases  growth in the number of flights we operated and the leasing of facilities at the new destinations added to our route network 
aircraft insurance and security services declined million percent or an improved percent on a casm basis primarily from a significant reduction in aircraft hull and passenger liability insurance rates in  despite increases in the insured fleet hull value as a result of the new b aircraft deliveries 
marketing and advertising increased million percent or an improved percent on a casm basis primarily reflecting our promotional efforts associated with the development of our new destinations and efforts to generate demand in all markets 

table of contents depreciation decreased million percent or an improved percent on a casm basis primarily due to the retirement of and owned aircraft during and  respectively 
other operating expenses increased million percent or an improved percent on a casm basis primarily from added passenger related costs associated with the higher level of operations  contractual costs related to the opening of new destinations and the costs associated with our new reservations system and other automation projects 
non operating expenses other income expense  net decreased by million primarily due to the receipt of a government reimbursement pursuant to the wartime act of million  partially offset by a charge related to the write off of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs due to the early retirement of debt and of conversion of debt to equity 
additionally  interest expense decreased by approximately million due to the payoff of high interest rate debt and the issuance of lower interest rate debt 
interest income increased approximately million due to higher cash balances available for investment 
income tax benefit income tax benefit was million and million for and  respectively 
as a result of our two consecutive years of profitable results in and and the expectation of continued profitability  we recorded a tax benefit of million as a result of the reversal of the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset related to our nol carryforwards 
we maintained a valuation allowance of approximately million consisting of million in amt credit carryforwards and million in state nol carryforwards that may expire without being used 
during we recorded income tax benefit of million due to a change in federal tax law as discussed below 
the job creation and worker assistance act of passed by congress in march resulted in a retroactive suspension of the amt nol percent limitation 
this legislation resulted in a tax benefit of million in in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  the effect of changes in tax laws or rates is included in income in the period that includes the enactment date  resulting in recognition of the change in the first quarter of liquidity and capital resources our primary source of funds are accumulated cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and cash provided by operations 
our primary uses of cash are for working capital including labor and fuel costs  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes  which may include acquisitions of other airlines and their assets  whether in connection with bankruptcy proceeding relating to such carriers of their assets or otherwise in other investments in strategic alliances  code share agreements or other business arrangements 
our cash and cash equivalents  including restricted cash  totaled million at december  compared to million at december  at year end we also held million in short term investments  representing auction rate securities with auction reset periods less than months 
operating activities generated million of cash in compared to million in our operating cash inflows are primarily derived from the sale of transportation for passengers aboard our airline 

table of contents in most cases our passengers pay us prior to the dates of their travel 
we record these advance payments as air traffic liability on our consolidated balance sheets 
the routine expenses of operating our aircraft to provide the transportation purchased by our customers represent the majority of our operating cash outflows 
for  the million decrease in cash flows generated by our operating activities was primarily due to the million reduction in our air traffic liability due to the timing of our customers advance payments relative to when the transportation was provided  the receipt of million during pursuant to the wartime act  which was not received in  a million reduction in restricted cash related to the release of a credit card holdback in  a million reduction in operating income in over due to increases in aircraft rent and fuel and a million increase in our accrued liabilities 
investing activities used million of cash in compared to million in our investing activities primarily consist of capital expenditures  aircraft purchase deposits required for aircraft scheduled for delivery in future periods and an increase in available for sale securities 
the primary increase in our investing activities for was related to the acquisition of support equipment  building improvements and upgrades to our computer systems 
our overall aircraft purchase deposits requirements were lower for due to the timing of payments relative to refunds received for aircraft deliveries 
we invested a net amount of approximately million in auction rate securities 
financing activities generated million of cash in compared to million in our financing activities primarily consisted of proceeds from the sale of stock offset by debt payments and debt issuance costs 
during we issued new convertible debt of million and paid down existing debt of million 
additionally in  we issued million shares of stock in a secondary offering in  receiving net proceeds of million 
commitments our expected contractual commitments to be paid were the following as of december  in millions nature of commitment total thereafter operating lease payments for aircraft and facility obligations aircraft fuel purchases long term debt obligations total contractual obligations and commitments excludes related interest payments and assumes that we will lease all aircraft  except for four aircraft committed under debt financing  even though financing has not been arranged for all aircraft 
a variety of assumptions were necessary in order to derive the information described in the paragraph herein  including  but not limited to i the timing of aircraft delivery dates  ii estimated rental factors which are correlated to floating interest rates prior to delivery  and iii future fuel prices  including fuel refining  transportation and into plane costs 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents aircraft purchase commitments as of december   airways had firm commitments with an aircraft manufacturer to purchase eight b aircraft in and and b aircraft with delivery dates between and additionally  airways has options and purchase rights to acquire an additional b aircraft with delivery dates between and in january  we exercised options for the delivery of two additional b with delivery dates in the b aircraft are to be financed through an affiliate of the aircraft manufacturer 
pursuant to airways arrangement with an aircraft leasing company  airways entered into individual operating leases for of the b aircraft of which six were delivered during  and has entered into sale leaseback transactions with that aircraft leasing company with respect to six related spare engines  to be delivered between and additionally  airways has obtained debt financing commitments for six b aircraft of which two were delivered during airways has obtained financing commitments from an affiliate of the aircraft manufacturer for up to of the purchase price of of the b aircraft should airways be unable to secure financing from the financial markets on acceptable terms 
during  airways is scheduled to take delivery of six b aircraft to be leased through an affiliate of the aircraft manufacturer and b aircraft with nine such aircraft subject to individual operating leases mentioned above and four b aircraft financed through debt 
there can be no assurance that sufficient financing will be available for all b aircraft and other capital expenditures not covered by firm financing commitments 
the following table details our firm orders for aircraft and options as of december  b deliveries b deliveries firm options firm options total we have purchase rights to acquire up to b aircraft in addition to the totals shown above 
during  in connection with airways agreements with an aircraft manufacturer  airways was refunded million in previously paid aircraft deposits and paid million in aircraft deposits under the new agreement with an aircraft manufacturer for the acquisition of b aircraft 
credit agreement we currently have a million credit agreement with our bank 
the agreement allows us to obtain letters of credit and enter into hedge agreements with the bank 
the agreement contains certain covenant requirements including liquidity tests 
we are in compliance with these covenants 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in letters of credit drawn against the credit agreement 
other commitments 
table of contents in may  we opened a two bay hangar facility at hartsfield jackson atlanta international airport 
the  square foot hangar will hold two of our b aircraft simultaneously and has a  square foot  two story office building attached to the hangar to house engineers and other support staff 
we have a year lease on the facility which expires in off balance sheet arrangements an off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has made guarantees  a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets  an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or that engages in leasing  hedging or research and development arrangements with the company 
we have no arrangements of the types described in the first three categories that we believe may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition liquidity or results or operations 
certain guarantees that we do not expect to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition liquidity or resulted operations are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
effective october   we adopted fasb interpretation fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires the consolidation of certain types of entities in which a company absorbs a majority of another entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the other entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the other entity 
these entities are called variable interest entities or vies 
the principal characteristics of vies are an insufficient amount of equity to absorb the entity s expected losses  equity owners as a group are not able to make decisions about the entity s activities  or equity that does not absorb the entity s losses or receive the entity s residual returns 
variable interests are contractual  ownership or other monetary interests in an entity that change with fluctuations in the entity s net asset value 
as a result  vies can arise from items such as lease agreements  loan arrangements  guarantees or service contracts 
if an entity is determined to be a vie  the entity must be consolidated by the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the holder of the variable interests that absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses or receive a majority of the entity s residual returns in the event no holder has a majority of the expected losses 
there is no primary beneficiary in cases where no single holder absorbs the majority of the expected losses or receives a majority of the residual returns 
the determination of the primary beneficiary is based on projected cash flows at the inception of the variable interest 
we have variable interests in our aircraft leases 
the lessors are trusts established specifically to purchase  finance and lease aircraft to us 
these leasing entities meet the criteria of vies 
we are generally not the primary beneficiary of the leasing entities if the lease terms are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include a residual value guarantee  a fixed price purchase option or similar feature that obligates us to absorb decreases in value or entitles us to participate in increases in the value of the aircraft 
this is the case in the majority of our aircraft leases  however we have two aircraft leases that contain fixed price purchase options that allow us to purchase the aircraft at predetermined prices on specified dates during the lease term 
we have not consolidated the related trusts because even taking into consideration these purchase options  we are still not the primary beneficiary based on our cash flow analysis 
critical accounting policies and estimates general 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as 
table of contents those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the following is a description of what we believe to be our most critical accounting policies and estimates see note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
passenger revenue is recognized when transportation is provided 
ticket sales for transportation which has not yet been provided are recorded as air traffic liability 
air traffic liability represents tickets sold for future travel dates and estimated refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel dates 
nonrefundable tickets expire one year from the date the ticket is purchased 
a small percentage of tickets expire unused 
we estimate the amount of future exchanges  net of forfeitures  for all unused tickets once the flight date has passed 
these estimates are based on historical experience 
passenger traffic commissions and related fees are expensed when the related revenue is recognized 
passenger traffic commissions and related fees not yet recognized are included as a prepaid expense 
frequent flyer program 
we accrue a liability for the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel for awards earned under our a rewards program based on awards we expect to be redeemed 
we adjust this liability based on points earned and redeemed as well as for changes in the estimated incremental costs 
points under our a rewards program may also be earned using our branded credit card 
a pro rated portion of revenue earned from this credit card is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when transportation is likely to be provided  based on estimates of fair value of tickets to be redeemed 
amounts received in excess of the tickets fair values are recognized in income currently 
accounting for long lived assets 
when appropriate  we evaluate our long lived assets in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events or circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the net book value of those assets 
in making these determinations  we utilize certain assumptions  including  but not limited to i estimated fair market value of the assets  and ii estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service the asset will be used in our operations  and estimated salvage values 
we have approximately million of long lived assets as of december  on a cost basis  including approximately million of flight equipment and related equipment on a cost basis 
inventories 
inventories consist of expendable aircraft spare parts  supplies  and prepaid aircraft fuel 
these items are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method fifo 
these items are charged to expense when used 
allowances for obsolescence are provided over the estimated useful life of the related aircraft and engines for spare parts expected to be on hand at the date aircraft are retired from service 
financial derivative instruments 
during we utilized derivative instruments  including crude oil and heating oil based derivatives  to hedge a portion of our exposure to jet fuel price increases 
these instruments consisted primarily of fixed price swap agreements and collar structures 
during we terminated these agreements 
upon early termination of a derivative contract  gains and losses deferred in other comprehensive income loss would continue to be reclassified to earnings as the related fuel is used 
gains and losses deferred in other comprehensive gain loss related to derivative instruments hedging forecasted transactions would be recognized into earnings immediately when the anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur 

table of contents recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial standards sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb among other items sfas r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based compensation  and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
the effective date of sfas r is the first reporting period beginning after june   which is the third quarter for calendar year companies  although early adoption is allowed 
sfas r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method  or a modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized in payments granted after that date based on the requirements of sfas for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas r 
under the modified retrospective method  the requirements are the same as under the modified prospective method  but also permits entities to restate financial statements of previous periods based on pro forma disclosures made in accordance with sfas we currently utilize a standard option pricing model  black scholes  to measure the fair value of the stock options granted to employees 
while sfas r permits entities to continue to use such a model  the standard also permits the use of a lattice model 
we have not yet determined which model we will use to measure the fair value of employee stock options upon the adoption of sfas r 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
sfas r also requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as under the current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date 
these amounts cannot be estimated because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
we currently expect to adopt sfas r effective july   however we have not yet determined which of the aforementioned adoption methods we will use 
subject to the methodology we select to calculate the cost associated with implementing the provisions in sfas r  the pro forma disclosure disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements may not be indicative of the actual cost to be incurred by us upon implementation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive instruments and positions we are subject to certain market risks  including interest rates and commodity prices ie  aircraft fuel 
the adverse effects of changes in these markets pose a potential loss as discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity  nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our financial accounting policies and additional information 

table of contents interest rates as of december  and  the fair value of our long term debt was estimated to be million and million  respectively  based upon discounted future cash flows using current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments or market prices 
market risk  estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates  was approximately million as of december   and approximately million as of december  our long term debt obligations that bear fixed rates of interest and may be prepaid without penalty prior to their respective maturity dates and  therefore  a change in market interest rates generally would not affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
if interest rates average higher in than in  for our variable rate debt  our interest expense would increase by approximately million 
aviation fuel our results of operations are impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel 
aircraft fuel accounted for percent and percent of our operating expenses in and  respectively
