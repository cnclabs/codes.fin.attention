in january  we experienced the unanticipated departure of approximately professionals from our corporate finance restructuring practice 
economic consulting practice 
within our economic consulting practice  we provide our clients with analyses of complex economic issues for use in legal and regulatory proceedings  strategic decision making and public policy debates 
in the fourth quarter of  we diversified our service offerings by acquiring specified assets and certain liabilities of lexecon  inc  from nextera enterprises  inc  to provide economic consulting services by the lexecon professionals  who are among the leading providers of these services in the united states 
our services now include providing advice and testimony related to o antitrust and competition issues that arise in the context of potential mergers and acquisitions  o other antitrust issues  including alleged price fixing  cartels and other forms of exclusionary behavior  o the application of modern finance theory to issues arising in securities litigation  and o public policy studies on behalf of companies  trade associations and governmental agencies 
all of our practices have experience providing testimony in the following areas fraud  damages  lost profits  valuation  accountant s liability and malpractice  contract disputes  patent infringement  price fixing  purchase price disputes  solvency and insolvency  fraudulent conveyance  preferences  disclosure statements  trademark and copyright infringement and the financial impact of government regulations 
we have unique capabilities in several highly specialized areas  including telecommunications  transportation  railroad  utilities  oil and gas  chemicals  energy  banking and investment banking  pharmaceuticals  tobacco  retail and information technology 
demand for our services is most often driven by non discretionary engagements involving businesses facing critical situations that are often adverse 
our clients include companies  as well as creditors or other stakeholders  such as financial institutions and private equity firms  and the law firms that represent them 
during  our clients included of the top us law firms  corporate clients in the fortune  and of the largest banks in the united states 
during  about of our revenues came from repeat business from existing clients and referrals 
our revenues from continuing operations have grown from million in to million in  at a compounded annual growth rate of 
during  we continued to integrate the businesses we acquired during into our company 
we believe demand for our services will continue to be strong  driven by a number of current and anticipated trends  including increasingly complex interplay between competitive and regulatory forces faced by a wide range of businesses that encourages  and in some cases  requires the use of outside financial consultants  
table of contents the need for objective  independent expertise for critical  business processes  and debt levels that companies are continuing to use and carry 
we believe that our reputation  national scale and large staff of highly qualified professionals  position us well to capitalize on the trends driving the growth in our practices 
trends affecting our business escalating public scrutiny and regulatory complexity 
we believe that factors driving our business include the increased awareness of the potential for corporate mismanagement or fraud  the heightened scrutiny that often uncovers alleged frauds and spawns investigations and litigation  the continuing trend in high stakes litigation and the effect of increased regulation 
for example  the sarbanes oxley legislation has added a layer of complex regulatory requirements for public companies 
faced with recent enhanced scrutiny by investors and government agencies of financial reporting and corporate governance  in part as a result of this legislation  companies have begun to hire outside professionals to review and analyze their accounting records  internal controls and financial reporting 
we believe that recent mandates arising from the sarbanes oxley legislation  and the emerging trend toward hiring consulting firms unaffiliated with company auditors  represent a fundamental shift in corporate and governmental policy 
we also anticipate that ever increasing litigation costs will require businesses to focus on better managing risks and the litigation process  particularly in large  complex  multi jurisdiction cases and mass tort claims 
these trends should directly benefit independent financial consulting service providers 
increasing need for independent expertise 
we believe that businesses  their creditors and other institutional stakeholders are increasingly engaging consulting firms to provide objective  independent expertise for highly critical business processes  especially in those areas that are complex  unique and incident driven 
businesses and financial institutions facing adverse circumstances have a need to access world class expertise to assist them in implementing tactical operating plans to solve significant business dilemmas 
this is particularly true in highly complex and sophisticated areas such as restructurings  bankruptcies  economic consulting  forensic accounting and high stakes legal proceedings 
trends in continuing use of corporate debt and debt default rates 
we believe that corporate debt levels and related default levels are important indicators of the potential need for restructuring  turnaround  bankruptcy and related consulting services 
us and international companies have increasingly relied on debt  including bank debt  to finance acquisitions  growth initiatives and working capital requirements  and therefore  we believe that debt levels will remain high 
the size of the public and private debt market  as measured by the amount of aggregate us corporate debt outstanding  has consistently expanded over the past years  regardless of economic cycles 
although debt default rates tend to decline during periods of economic expansion  we believe that economic expansion also facilitates new issuances of speculative grade debt  as investors are generally willing to tolerate higher levels of risk during these periods 
notwithstanding increases in debt  in  we have seen a decline of the mega bankruptcy cases  resulting in a greater portion of our business being comprised of engagements relating to bankruptcy and restructuring matters involving mid size companies 
business strategy we are one of the largest providers of forensic and litigation consulting and technology  corporate finance restructuring and economic consulting services in the united states 
we have a year track record of performance and overall expertise 
we provide high caliber consulting services through our staff of professionals who are able to quickly staff even the largest and most complex assignments

we strive to manage the renegotiation of written employment arrangements in advance of their expiration dates 
we take a disciplined approach when recruiting additional professionals 
we focus on hiring qualified individuals who meet our selective criteria 
leverage our relationships and expertise 
we work hard to maintain our existing client relationships and develop new ones 
we believe that our existing client relationships and our reputation among other professionals  coupled with our recognized expertise  track record and size  are the most critical elements in a decision to retain us 
we receive a significant amount of repeat business and referrals from our financial institution clients  from our clients in regulated industries  and from law firm clients 
we strive to build client relationships on a company wide basis  and to that end we enter into corporate as opposed to personal engagements 
in this way  our goal is to develop client relationships that are not entirely dependent on the expertise of any particular professionals  although it is often difficult to decouple client and professional relationships 
by successfully leveraging our reputation  experience and expanded client base  we believe we should obtain engagements from both existing and new clients 
expand the range of our consulting services 
we believe that a number of factors driving demand for our services are non cyclical in nature 
these factors include general economic factors  the effects of regulation and competition on various industries  under performing companies  ineffective business strategies  highly leveraged capital structures  failed acquisitions  corporate fraud and the increasing number of high stakes lawsuits 
one way to minimize cyclicality is to diversify our services 
in the fourth quarter of  we diversified our service offerings to expand our economic consulting practice through the acquisition of lexecon  one of the leading providers of these services in the united states 
the professionals  who joined us in the fourth quarter of from ten eyck  provide consulting services relating to sec and other regulatory investigations  securities law litigation  sec accounting and enforcement  fraud investigations and sarbanes oxley 
we have also increased our capacity to assist clients in the analysis and resolution of all phases of complex claims and disputes through the acquisition of the us dispute advisory services business of kpmg llp 
other business activities that contributed to diversification in include our investment banking and merger and acquisition services to middle market companies through our registered broker dealer and national association of securities dealers  or nasd  member  our transaction advisory and interim management services  and our corporate finance restructuring services in the united kingdom  that commenced in we believe diversification of our service offerings will better insulate our overall business from changing or fluctuating market conditions 
selectively acquire companies and integrate our new professionals and capabilities into our business 
we have always followed a disciplined approach to acquisitions 
our selective approach has allowed us to acquire businesses on attractive terms 
since january  we have completed seven significant acquisitions that have greatly enhanced our practices 
we intend to selectively pursue strategic acquisitions that are complementary to our practices and expand our range of services and products 
this should enable us to diversify and better perform the services we offer our existing client base  expand our staff of expert professionals and add new clients 
manage utilization of our professionals

our goal is to manage growth to maintain utilization rates among all of our

our goal is to attain utilization rates that allow us to maintain our profitability  make us less vulnerable to fluctuations in our workload  and minimize seasonal factors affecting utilization

in some cases  we extend forgivable loans to professionals below the executive officer level in lieu of paying cash signing bonuses 
we believe that the loan arrangements which require repayment in full if the employee s employment terminates on certain events prior to his contract s expiration date  enhance our ability to retain senior professionals 
employment agreements may provide for the payment of salary  accrued bonuses and other benefits beyond the termination date  if the professional leaves our employ for certain reasons prior to the agreement s expiration date 
the length and amount of payments to be paid by us following the termination or resignation of a professional varies depending on whether such person resigned or was terminated with cause or good reason  resigned or was terminated without cause or good reason  died or became disabled  or was terminated as a result of a change of control

in marketing our services  we emphasize our experience  the quality of our services and our professionals particular areas of expertise  as well as our ability to quickly staff a new engagement 
while we aggressively seek new business opportunities  we maintain high professional standards and carefully evaluate potential new client relationships and engagements before accepting them 
in the fourth quarter of  we reorganized our marketing and sales divisions to employ full time people  who assist with the marketing of our consulting services 
competition our business is highly competitive 
our competitors range from large organizations  such as the national accounting firms and the large management consulting companies that offer a broad range of consulting services  to small firms and independent contractors that provide one specialized service 
competitive factors affecting demand for our services include reputation  size  ability to immediately staff a substantial engagement  performance record  quality of work  range of services provided and existing client relationships 
to a lesser extent  we also compete on price  but the critical nature of our services typically reduces price to a secondary consideration 
since our business depends in a large part on professional relationships  our business has low barriers of entry for professionals  including our professionals  wanting to start their own firms or to change employers 
some national service providers are larger than we are and  on any given engagement  may have a competitive advantage over us with respect to one or more competitive factors 
the smaller local or regional firms  while not offering the range of services we provide  often are able to provide the lowest price on a specific engagement because of their lower overhead costs and proximity to the engagement 
patents  licenses and proprietary information we consider certain of our products and processes  including our trialmax comprehensive trial preparation software  proprietary and confidential 
the ringtail casebook software that we acquired from the ringtail group on february  has been registered pursuant to us federal copyright laws  and we consider the other technologies and software that we acquired in connection with the ringtail transaction to be proprietary and confidential 
we believe that our non patented software and intellectual property  particularly some of our process software and intellectual property  is important to our forensic and litigation consulting and technology practice 
we rely upon non disclosure agreements and contractual agreements and a system of internal controls  including  without limitation  confidentiality and invention disclosure agreements with our employees and independent contractors  and license agreements with third parties  to protect our proprietary information 
despite these safeguards  there is a risk that competitors may obtain and use such information 
human resources at december   we had  employees  of which were billable professionals 
we also engage independent contractors to supplement our professionals on client engagements as needed 
most of our professionals have many years of experience in their field of practice  and many are well recognized for their expertise and experience 
none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining contracts or represented by a union 
we believe our relationship with our employees is good

catanese  associate general counsel and secretary  fti consulting  inc  bestgate road  suite  annapolis  maryland  telephone number business risks our failure to retain qualified professionals or hire additional qualified professionals would have a negative effect on our future growth and financial performance as well as client engagements  services and relationships 
our business involves the delivery of professional forensic and litigation consulting and technology  corporate finance restructuring and economic consulting services 
in the consulting business  professional acumen  trust and relationships are critical elements of a company s ability to deliver high quality professional services 
our professionals have highly specialized skills 
they also develop strong bonds with the clients they service 
our continued success depends upon our ability to retain and expand our staff of professionals who have expertise  reputations and client relationships critical to maintaining and developing our business 
we face intense competition in recruiting and retaining highly qualified professionals that we must have to continue our service offerings 
as of december   substantially all of the senior managing directors have written employment agreements with the company 
many of our employment agreements will expire between and because of the timing of our acquisitions and our initiative to enter into written agreements with our senior professionals 
we monitor these expirations carefully to commence dialogues with professionals regarding their employment well in advance of the actual contract expiration dates 
our goal is to renew employment agreements when advisable and to stagger the expirations of the agreements if possible 
because of the high concentration of contract expirations between and  we may experience high turnover or other adverse consequences  such as higher costs  loss of clients and engagements  or difficulty staffing engagements  if we are unable to renegotiate employment arrangements or the costs of retaining qualified professionals become higher 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain enough qualified professionals to maintain or expand our business 
moreover  competition has been increasing our costs of retaining or hiring qualified professionals  a trend which could harm our operating margins and results of operations 
if our former professionals go into business in competition with us or join our competitors  our client engagements and relationships could decline  financial performance and growth could slow or decline  and employee morale could suffer  and we may not have legal recourse 
typically  our professionals have a close relationship with the clients they serve  not only based on their expertise but also on bonds of personal trust and confidence 
although our clients generally contract for services with us as a company  and not with individual professionals  in the event that professionals leave  such clients would not be prohibited from hiring those professionals to perform future engagements 
clients could also decide 
table of contents to transfer active engagements to professionals who leave 
the engagement letters that we typically enter into with clients do not obligate them to continue to use our services 
typically  our engagement letters permit clients to terminate our services at any time 
furthermore  while in some cases  the termination of an ongoing engagement by a client could constitute a breach of the client s contract with us  we could decide that preserving the over all client relationship is more important than seeking damages for the breach  and for that or other reasons that are not currently identifiable  decide not to pursue any legal remedies that might be available to us 
we would make the determination whether to pursue any legal actions against a client on a case by case basis 
as of december   substantially all of the senior managing directors have written employment agreements with the company  which may include non competition and non solicitation arrangements 
where we have written non competition agreements  they generally have been drafted to comply with state reasonableness standards 
however  states generally interpret non competition clauses narrowly 
therefore  a state may hold certain restrictions on competition to be unenforceable 
in the case of former ringtail employees residing in australia  the non competition provisions have been drafted to comply with australian law 
in the event an employee departs  we will consider any legal remedies we may have against such professional on a case by case basis 
however  we may decide that preserving cooperation and a professional relationship  or other concerns  outweigh the benefits of any possible legal recovery 
therefore  we could determine not to pursue legal action  even if available 
in the first quarter of  we experienced the unanticipated departures of about professionals in our former fti policano manzo restructuring practice 
we have striven to build relationships and reassure our professionals and clients of our interest in them and our ability to provide services comparable to those provided by the departing professionals 
those departures had a negative impact on our financial results for in the fourth quarter of  we entered into a monetary settlement of arbitration proceeds brought against those former employees and the company they formed to compete with us 
see item legal proceedings 
our profitability will suffer if we are not able to manage utilization and pricing rates of our professional staff 
we calculate the utilization rate for our professional staff by dividing the number of hours that all of our professionals worked on client assignments during a period by the total available working hours for all of our professionals  assuming a hour work week and a week year 
available working hours include vacation and professional training days  but exclude holidays 
the hourly rates we charge our clients for our services and the number of hours our professionals are able to charge our clients for our services are affected by the level of expertise and experience of the professionals working on a particular engagement and  to a lesser extent  the pricing and staffing policies of our competitors 
if we fail to manage our utilization rates for our professionals or maintain or increase the hourly rates we charge our clients for our services  we may experience adverse consequences  such as non revenue generating professionals  the loss of clients and engagements and the inability to appropriately staff engagements  and our profitability will suffer 
demand for our corporate finance restructuring professionals declined in  which may continue  primarily as a result of general economic conditions  including the strengthening of the economy  the availability of credit  low interest rates  fewer mergers and acquisitions and fewer large bankruptcy proceedings 
our operating profit margins declined in  which may continue  due to the slow down in our corporate finance restructuring business and due to lower utilization rates in that practice and our recently acquired businesses relative to our historical experiences 
we also experienced lower utilization in our forensic and litigation consulting and technology practice during late and the early part of resulting from the absorption of the professionals who joined us in connection with our acquisition of the dispute advisory services of kpmg llp 
many of the billable professionals that resigned during the first quarter of  were among our highest utilized and billing professionals  which also contributed to our lower utilization rates and operating profit margins in 
table of contents we rely heavily on our senior management team and practice leaders for the success of our business 
we rely heavily upon our senior management team and practice leaders to manage our forensic and litigation consulting and technology  corporate finance restructuring and economic consulting practices 
given the highly specialized nature of our services and the scale of our operations  these people must have a thorough understanding of our service offerings as well as the skills and experience necessary to manage a large organization 
if one or more members of our senior management team or our practice leaders leave and we cannot replace them with a suitable candidate quickly  we could experience difficulty in managing our business properly  and this could harm our business prospects  client relationships  employee morale and results of operations 
we face intense competition in our business 
if we fail to compete effectively  we may miss new business opportunities or lose existing clients and our revenues and profitability may decline 
parties from whom we acquire assets may reenter the marketplace to compete with us in the future 
the market for our consulting services is highly competitive 
our competitors range from large organizations  such as the national accounting firms and the large management consulting companies that offer a broad range of consulting services  to small firms and independent contractors that provide one specialized service 
some of our competitors have significantly more financial resources  larger professional staffs and greater brand recognition than we do 
since our business depends in a large part on professional relationships  our business has low barriers of entry for professionals wanting to start their own firms 
in addition  it is relatively easy for professionals to change employers 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to compete successfully for new business opportunities or retain our existing clients or professional employees 
although  in connection with our acquisitions  we obtain non competition arrangements from the sellers  we cannot assure you that any one or more of them will not compete with us in the future 
also  the duration of those agreements are limited ranging from one to three years after the acquisition date 
certain activities may be carved out of  or otherwise may not be prohibited by those arrangements 
also  in some cases we may agree to restraints on our ability to compete with the sellers of those businesses with respect to certain practice areas or locations 
competition may harm our expected revenue growth and results of operations and cause the actual profitability of the business to differ materially from our expectations and the expectations of the investing public 
a failure to meet these expectations could cause the price of our stock to decline 
in connection with the brs acquisition from pwc  we obtained a three year agreement from pwc not to compete with us 
on december   we filed an action in the supreme court of the state of new york against pwc seeking enforcement of the non competition covenants  damages  and injunctive and other equitable relief 
on november   we entered into a settlement and release in the action  which enforces the current non compete until august  see item legal proceedings 
any claims involving the quality of our services could harm our overall professional reputation  which could harm our ability to compete for new business opportunities  retain and attract clients and engagements  and hire and retain qualified professionals 
many of our engagements involve complex analysis and the exercise of professional judgment 
therefore  we are subject to the risk of professional liability 
often  our engagements involve matters that  if resolved unfavorably  may result in a severe impact on the client s business  cause the client a substantial monetary loss or prevent the client from pursuing business opportunities 
since our ability to attract new clients and generate engagements depends upon our ability to maintain a high degree of client satisfaction as well as our reputation among industry professionals  any claims against us involving the quality of our services may be more damaging than similar claims against businesses in other industries 
we do not generally indemnify our clients  however  in certain cases  such as with clients who are governmental agencies or authorities  we may agree to indemnify them and their affiliates against third party liabilities 
indemnification provisions are negotiated on a contract by contract basis and in some cases may be reciprocal or may be coupled with limitations on the amount and type of damages that can be recovered 

table of contents any claim by a client or a third party against us could expose us to professional or other liabilities in excess of our insurance limits 
we maintain a limited amount of liability insurance 
the damages and or expenses resulting from any successful claims against us  for indemnity or otherwise  in excess of our insurance limits would have to be borne directly by us and could seriously harm our profitability and financial resources 
our clients may terminate our engagements with little or no notice  which may cause us to experience unexpected declines in our profitability and utilization 
much of our business involves large client engagements that we staff with a substantial number of professionals 
the engagement letters that we typically enter into with clients do not obligate them to continue to use our services 
typically  our engagement letters permit clients to terminate our services at any time 
if our clients unexpectedly cancel engagements with us or curtail the scope of our engagements  we may be unable to replace the lost revenues from those engagements  may also be unable to quickly eliminate costs associated with those engagements  and we may not be able to quickly find other engagements to utilize our professionals 
any decrease in revenues without a corresponding reduction in our costs will likely harm our profitability 
we may have difficulty integrating our acquisitions  or convincing clients to allow assignment of their contracts to us  which may cause our client engagements to decline  with a consequent detrimental affect on our financial results 
the process of integrating our acquisitions into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial  operational and managerial resources that would otherwise be available for the operation  development and expansion of our existing business 
to the extent that we have miscalculated our ability to integrate and properly manage any or all of our acquisitions  we may have difficulty in achieving our operating and strategic objectives 
a substantial amount of our growth has been due to acquisitions 
during  we acquired the brs practice 
during  we completed three significant acquisitions  lexecon  the former dispute advisory business of kpmg llp and ten eyck  all of which occurred in the fourth quarter 
since year end  we have acquired the ringtail business 
the level of integration of these businesses at this time differs 
companies face significant challenges integrating acquisitions of personnel and assets 
some of the problems we face include differences in corporate cultures and management styles  additional or conflicting government regulation  disparate company polices and practices and client conflict issues 
all of our acquisitions in and our ringtail acquisition in were structured as asset transactions  therefore  a significant number of client engagements with those practices could not be assigned to us without client consent 
all clients may not affirmatively consent to the assignment 
in addition  in some cases there are no written client contracts memorializing an engagement 
such engagements will only continue at the pleasure of those clients 
in certain cases  such as government contracts and bankruptcy engagements  the consents of clients cannot be solicited until after the acquisition has closed 
further such contracts may be subject to security clearance requirements or bidding provisions with which we might not be able to comply 
there is no assurance that local  state and federal governments will agree to novate their contracts to us 
in addition  in an engagement that involves a bankruptcy case  we must make a filing with the applicable us trustee  at which time such us trustee may find that we are no longer disinterested 
in connection with such bankruptcy cases  we may be required to resign and to refund fees collected in connection with those engagements 
we could be responsible for returning fees even if they were not paid to us  but were paid to the company from whom we acquired the business 
in some cases  we may not have legal recourse to demand that the seller of the business reimburse us 
our corporate finance restructuring practice has an increased risk of fee nonpayment 
many of our clients have engaged us because they are experiencing financial distress 
we recognize that these clients may not have sufficient funds to continue operations or to pay for our services 
we have not received retainers before we began performing services on the client s behalf in connection with a significant amount of our restructuring business 
in the cases that we have received retainers  we cannot assure you that the 
table of contents retainers will adequately cover our fees for the services we perform on behalf of these clients 
we are not always able to obtain retainers from clients in bankruptcy as the bankruptcy court must approve our retainers for those clients 
even if a bankruptcy court approves our retainer or engagement  a bankruptcy court has the discretion to require us to return all  or a portion of  our fees 
therefore  we face the risk of nonpayment  which can result in write offs 
for the three years ended december   we wrote off a total of about million of uncollectible fees in all practices 
our total write offs exclude unbilled fee adjustments and amounts attributable to our applied sciences practice  which we sold in more write offs than we expect in any period would have a negative impact on our results of operations 
if the size  complexity and number of debt defaults  bankruptcy or restructuring actions or other factors affecting demand for our corporate finance restructuring services declines  our revenues and profitability could suffer 
our corporate finance restructuring practice provides various restructuring and restructuring related services to companies in financial distress or their creditors or other stakeholders 
a number of factors affect demand for this practice s services 
these include the availability and level of lending activity  interest rates and over leveraging of companies  over expansion by various businesses  merger and acquisition activity  management problems  and the general economic factors resulting in the decline in the economy in the us notwithstanding increases in debt  we have also seen a decline of the mega bankruptcy cases  resulting in a greater portion of our business being comprised of engagements relating to bankruptcy and restructuring matters involving mid size companies primarily as a result of general economic conditions  including the strengthening of the economy  the availability of credit  low interest rates  fewer mergers and acquisitions and fewer large bankruptcy proceedings 
in our experience  mid size bankruptcy and restructuring engagements are more susceptible to cyclical factors such as holidays and vacations 
the shift to mid size engagements could result in lower utilization during the third and fourth quarters due to these factors 
declines in demand for our restructuring  turnaround  restructuring and bankruptcy services as well as smaller engagements could result in lower revenues and lower our overall profitability 
if we fail to find suitable acquisition candidates  or if we are unable to take advantage of opportunistic acquisition situations  our ability to expand may be curtailed 
the number of suitable acquisition candidates may decline if the competition for acquisition candidates increases 
as a result  we may be unable to make acquisitions or be forced to pay more or agree to less advantageous acquisition terms for the companies that we are able to acquire 
alternatively  at the time an acquisition opportunity presents itself internal and external pressures including  but not limited to  borrowing capacity under our credit facility or the availability of alternative financing  may cause us to be unable to pursue or complete an acquisition 
our ability to grow our business  particularly through acquisitions  may depend on our ability to raise capital by selling equity or debt securities or obtaining additional debt financing 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be able to obtain financing when we need it or on terms acceptable to us 
in any case  we may be unable to grow our business or expand our service offerings  as quickly as we have in the past  and our profitability may decline 
we may not manage our growth effectively  and our profitability may suffer 
we have experienced rapid growth in recent years 
this rapid expansion of our business may strain our management team  human resources and information systems 
we cannot assure you that we can successfully manage the integration of any businesses we may acquire or that they will result in the financial  operational and 
table of contents other benefits that we anticipate 
to manage our growth successfully  we may need to add qualified managers and employees and periodically update our operating  financial and other systems  as well as our internal procedures and controls 
we also must effectively motivate  train and manage a larger professional staff 
such expansion may result in significant expenditures 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be harmed 
from time to time we operate with a substantial amount of debt  with variable interest rates 
our total long term debt at december   was million 
we have historically incurred debt to make acquisitions 
we borrowed approximately million to acquire the lexecon practice in november operating with a high amount of leverage could require us to redirect a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our debt 
this would reduce the funds available for operations  future business opportunities  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other purposes 
it will also limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and our industry 
the terms of our debt also require us to meet specified financial covenants 
if we fail either to meet these financial requirements or our lenders do not waive them  we will be required to pay fees and penalties 
our lenders could also accelerate the maturity of our debt if we fail to meet these covenants  which would force us to seek alternative financing 
if this were to happen  we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain the additional financing we may need or that it would be on terms favorable to us 
our debt accrues interest at a variable rate 
although currently we do not  we have in the past and may in the future  enter into interest rate swaps to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates 
these hedge arrangements may result in us incurring higher interest expenses than we would have incurred without the hedges in place 
if interest rates increase  we will need to dedicate more of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our debt 
our revenues  operating income and cash flows are likely to fluctuate 
we have experienced fluctuating revenues  operating income and cash flow and expect that this will occur from time to time in the future 
we may experience future fluctuations in our annual or quarterly revenues and operating income because of the timing of our client assignments  the types of assignments we are working on at different times  hiring trends and decreased productivity because of vacations taken by our professionals 
this means our profitability will likely decline if we experience an unexpected variation in the number or timing of client assignments or during the third quarter when substantial numbers of professionals take vacations  which reduces their utilization rates 
we may also experience future fluctuations in our cash flows because of the timing of the payment of incentive compensation to our professionals  which we generally pay during the first quarter of each year 
also  the timing of any future acquisitions and the cost of integrating them may cause fluctuations in our operating results 
a significant portion of lexecon s revenues result from relationships with clients and industry professionals maintained by messrs 
fischel  carlton and kalt 
the loss of one or more of them could decrease our revenues and our profitability 
the success of our acquisition of lexecon will depend upon our retention of messrs 
fischel  carlton and kalt 
they have reputations in the field of economics for highly specialized expertise as well as important relationships with existing clients and industry professionals 
their reputations and relationships are critical to retaining and gaining new client engagements  particularly large  complex matters 
we have written five year employment agreements with messrs 
fischel  carlton and kalt 
the loss of messrs 
fischel  carlton or kalt could harm the success of our acquisition of the lexecon practice 

table of contents we have a different system of governance and management from the companies from whom we made our acquisitions  which could cause senior professionals who joined us from the acquired companies to leave us 
lexecon  the das and the brs businesses shared many of the management practices and policies of their parent companies 
we believe our management practices and policies differ from the practices and policies of those companies  including  but not limited to  the manner in which potential conflicts of interest were handled 
in some cases  these different management practices and policies may lead to workplace dissatisfaction on the part of those professionals with our way of conducting business 
the loss of one or more key professionals may harm our business and results of operations 
our clients may preclude us from representing multiple clients in connection with the same engagement or competitive matter  our other practices may be precluded from accepting engagements from clients with respect to the same or competitive matter for which another practice has been engaged to provide services  and we may be required to agree to forego potential business prospects in order to win engagements  which could harm our revenues  results of operations and client relationships and engagements 
we follow internal practices to assess real and potential relationships between and among our clients  engagements  practices and professionals 
for example  we generally will not represent parties adverse to each other in the same matter 
under bankruptcy rules we generally may not represent both a debtor and its creditors on the same engagement 
under federal bankruptcy laws  we are required to notify the us trustee of real or potential conflicts 
the us trustee could find that we no longer meet the disinterestedness standard because of real or potential conflicts  and order us to resign and refund fees that have been paid 
in some cases we could be ordered to refund fees that were not paid to us  but that were paid to the sellers of businesses that we acquired 
we may not have recourse to recover any or all of any refunded fees from such sellers 
future relationships may require us to decline or resign from client engagements 
new acquisitions may require us to resign from current client engagements because of relationship issues that are not currently identifiable 
in addition  businesses that we acquire may not be free to accept engagements they could have accepted prior to our acquiring them because of relationship issues 
our inability to accept engagements from clients or prospective clients  represent multiple clients in connection with the same or competitive engagements  and any requirement that we resign from client engagements may negatively impact our revenues  revenue growth and results of operations 
item properties we lease about  square feet of office space for our principal corporate facilities located in annapolis  maryland  under various leases expiring through august we also lease offices in other cities across the us  including such cities as new york  chicago  houston  dallas  los angeles and washington  dc  as well as london  england  to support our operations 
item legal proceedings from time to time in the ordinary course of business  we are subject to claims  asserted or unasserted  or named as a party to lawsuits or investigations 
litigation  in general  and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular  can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations 
moreover  the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with any certainty and in the case of more complex legal proceedings such as intellectual property and securities litigation  the results are difficult to predict at all 
we are not aware of any asserted or unasserted legal proceedings or claims that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of our operations 
on february   we filed suit in superior court  in north bergen  new jersey against a number of former employees and the new corporation they formed 
in our complaint  we assert numerous claims  including that these former employees acted contrary to their obligations and breached their duties of loyalty by wrongfully soliciting numerous of our employees to leave the company and to join them in a competitive venture  wrongly 
table of contents solicited our clients and unlawfully used and disclosed our confidential  proprietary and trade secret information in the new business venture 
subsequently  the parties agreed to resolve the matter through arbitration and to protect the confidentiality of all records and proceedings 
on december   before going to arbitration  the parties settled this action for an agreed upon amount and executed settlement and release agreements 
on december   we filed an action in the supreme court of the state of new york against pricewaterhousecoopers llp seeking damages  and injunctive and other equitable relief  and the enforcement of the non competition covenants contained in our asset purchase agreement with pricewaterhousecoopers relating to the acquisition of its domestic business recovery services division 
on february   the court granted in part and denied in part our motion for preliminary injunction 
pricewaterhousecoopers appealed the ruling and in june  the supreme court of the state of new york upheld the preliminary injunction and affirmed our interpretation of the non competition sections of the asset purchase agreement 
on november   the parties executed a settlement and release in the case pursuant to which pricewaterhousecoopers paid an agreed upon amount  the current injunction remains in place until august   and the action was dismissed with leave to refile  if there is a violation of the injunction
