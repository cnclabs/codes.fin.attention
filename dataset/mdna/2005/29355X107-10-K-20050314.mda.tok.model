overview overview 
enpro industries  inc enpro or the company was incorporated on january   as a wholly owned subsidiary of the goodrich corporation goodrich in anticipation of goodrich s announced distribution of its engineered industrial products eip segment to existing goodrich shareholders  which took place on may  the distribution 
we are a leader in the design  development  manufacturing and marketing of proprietary engineered industrial products 
we manage our business as three segments  a sealing products segment  which includes our sealing products  heavy duty wheel end components and ptfe products  an engineered products segment  which includes our metal polymer bearings  air compressor systems and vacuum pumps  and reciprocating compressor components  and an engine products and services segment  which includes heavy duty  medium speed diesel and natural gas engines 
prior to this report  we reported our results of operations under two business segments  a sealing products segment and an engineered products segment 
beginning with this report  we will report our results of operations as three business segments  a sealing products segment  an engineered products segment  and an engine products and services segment 
our segment disclosures for prior periods have been reclassified to reflect the fact that our former engineered products segment has been broken into two segments  our engineered products segment and our engine products and services segment 
for purposes of our segment disclosures  segment profit is total segment revenue reduced by operating expenses and restructuring and new facilities costs identifiable with the segment 
corporate expenses  net interest expense  asbestos related expenses  gains losses or impairments related to the sale of assets  income taxes and other expenses not directly attributable to the segments are not included in the computation of segment profit 
the accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those for enpro 
our sealing products segment designs  manufactures and sells sealing products  including sheet gaskets  metallic gaskets  resilient metal seals  compression packing  rotary lip seals  elastomeric seals  hydraulic components  expansion joints and ptfe products 
these products are used in a variety of industries  including chemical and petrochemical processing  petroleum extraction and refining  pulp and paper processing  heavy duty trucking  power generation  food and pharmaceutical processing  primary metal manufacturing  mining  water and waste treatment and semiconductor fabrication 
our engineered products segment includes operations that design  manufacture and sell self lubricating  non rolling  metal polymer bearing products  air compressor systems and vacuum pumps  and reciprocating compressor components 
these products are used in a wide range of industrial applications  including the pharmaceutical  pulp and paper  gas transmission  health  construction  petrochemical and automotive industries 
our engine products and services segment designs  manufactures  sells and services heavy duty  medium speed diesel and natural gas engines 
the government and general market for marine propulsion  power generation  and pump and compressor applications use these products and services 
since the distribution  we have focused on four management initiatives increasing productivity through our total customer value  or tcv  lean enterprise program  expanding our product offerings and customer base through our ennovation initiative and new operations in new geographic markets  strengthening the mix of our business by strategic acquisitions and divestitures  and managing the asbestos settlements of our subsidiaries to minimize the impact on cash flows and enhance our liquidity 
the following discusses our consolidated results of operations  cash flows and financial condition after the distribution and coltec s consolidated results of operations  cash flows and financial condition as it operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of goodrich prior to the distribution  including the adjustments and allocations necessary for a fair presentation of the business 
prior to the distribution  coltec owned the eip business as well as an aerospace business 
the transfer of coltec s aerospace business to goodrich prior to the distribution constituted the disposal of a segment 
accordingly  coltec s aerospace business has been accounted for as a discontinued operation and its revenues  costs and expenses  and cash flows have been segregated in the historical consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
unless otherwise noted  the following discussion pertains only to continuing operations 
following the distribution  coltec became a wholly owned subsidiary of enpro and coltec s former aerospace business continues to be owned by goodrich 
the following discussion of the consolidated results of operations does not necessarily include all of the expenses that would have been incurred by coltec prior to the distribution had it been a separate  stand alone entity and may not necessarily reflect what coltec s consolidated results of operations  cash flows and financial condition would have been had coltec been a stand alone entity prior to the distribution or what our consolidated results of operations  cash flows and financial condition may be in the future

corporate expenses include general corporate administrative costs

the accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those for enpro 
compared to sales increased in to million compared to million in nearly every operation experienced an increase in volume  with several operations experiencing double digit percentage increases 
the increase in demand and order activity was in line with the markets we serve 
in addition to the higher volumes  the increase in the value of the euro  when compared to the dollar  accounted for approximately three percentage points of the increase in sales 
this change favorably impacted revenue at the european operations of garlock sealing technologies  ggb and france compressor products for the year 
segment profit was million in  which was a improvement over the million reported in higher volumes at most operations  selected price increases  and the impact of stronger foreign currency rates had a favorable impact on segment profits 
these improvements were partially offset by a less favorable product mix  increased raw materials prices  especially in metals  and higher energy costs 
the results also include a loss of million for expected cost overruns on engine programs at fairbanks morse engine 
performance issues surrounding the production of new engine models and a weaker dollar  which increased the costs for engine components manufactured outside of the united states  required us to establish this provision 
additionally  we incurred restructuring and other expense of million in  compared to million in  primarily associated with activities at our france compressor products operations in the us and the ggb operations in france 
segment margins were in compared to in net income of million in was higher than the reported net income of million in net income was impacted by the items discussed below corporate expenses increased to million in compared to million in the increase in was primarily due to the rise in enpro s stock price and the effect that had on stock based compensation 
asbestos related expenses were million in compared to million in higher defense costs associated with an increase in trials and lower recoveries from insolvent insurance carriers in contributed to the increase 
during  we received approximately million from an insurer to settle our claims for reimbursement of past costs relating to certain environmental matters  and estimated future claims that had previously been reserved by us 
net interest expense decreased from million in to million in as the result of repayment of variable rate promissory notes and industrial revenue bonds 
results of operations in included a million loss in the fair value of our call options on goodrich common stock 
the fair value of the call options increased by million in the call options are derivative instruments and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value reflected in income 
changes in the fair value of the call options do not affect cash flows 
we use the call options to protect against the risk that our convertible preferred securities term income deferred equity securities tides  which under certain circumstances are convertible into goodrich and enpro common stock  could exceed their aggregate liquidation value if converted 
in  we recognized a loss of million in connection with the divestiture of our haber tool and sterling die businesses  partially offset by a gain of million primarily associated with the sale of a building we no longer needed as a result of our restructuring initiatives 
following is a discussion of the operating results for each segment 
sealing products 
sales increased in to million from million in foreign currency rates accounted for four percentage points of this increase in higher volumes at stemco contributed to this increase as a result of improved aftermarket activity and higher oem production order levels in the heavy duty truck and trailer markets 
sales at garlock sealing technologies increased in due to higher demand from the steel and nuclear industries  as well as increased shipments to the upstream oil and gas production industries as a result of the pikotek acquisition 
garlock rubber technologies sales increased compared to as a result of higher demand in the conveyor belt market 
additionally  plastomer technologies experienced an increase in sales  when compared to  due to higher demand for ptfe components and specialty tapes 
segment profit increased to million in compared to million in this increase was primarily a result of volume gains  and selected price increases 
however  higher raw material costs  as well as an unfavorable product mix partially offset these improvements 
segment margins increased from in to in engineered products 
sales were million in  which was higher than the million reported in foreign currency rates accounted for four percentage points of this increase in increased industrial demand for compressors and aftermarket parts resulted in higher sales at quincy compressor in additionally  ggb experienced higher demand in the industrial and automotive markets in the americas and europe 
sales at france compressor products in increased by primarily due to higher european sales and the impact of favorable exchange rates 
haber tool and sterling die  which were sold in mid year  contributed million in sales in  compared to million in in  segment profit increased to million from million in despite million of restructuring costs  ggb profits increased in as a result of volume gains  a more favorable product mix  benefits from restructuring in prior years  and the positive impact of the foreign currency rates 
increased demand and selected price increases resulted in higher profits for quincy in restructuring expense of million  associated with the relocation of france compressor products to houston  resulted in lower profits at that business in as a result of the mid year divestiture of the haber tool and sterling die businesses  segment profit in included only two quarters of results for these operations compared to a full year in segment margins decreased from in to in engine products and services 
sales increased in to million from million in fairbanks morse engine reported higher revenue due to an increase in engine shipments associated with us navy shipbuilding programs 
however  this increase was partially offset by lower parts and service sales in segment profit decreased to million in compared to million in the decline in profit was the result of lower aftermarket sales and a million loss recorded in the third quarter of in connection with cost overruns on several engine programs 
segment margins in were compared to in compared to sales increased in to million compared to million in stronger foreign currency rates  particularly the euro  increased sales year over year 
segment sales were impacted by lower engine shipments at fairbanks morse engine  with sales at all other operations flat year over year in the aggregate 
the timing of engine shipments had a significant effect on sales levels  although the relatively low profitability had a limited impact on our segment profit 
part of the volume decline also was the result of the divestiture of certain low margin operations in late and early the decline in engine shipments was mitigated by increased demand by the heavy duty trucking industry for sealing and related products 
segment profit was million in  which was a improvement over the million reported in the largest contributor to the increase in segment profit was stronger foreign currency rates 
this improvement resulted from lower restructuring expenses  cost reductions and a warranty claim that reduced earnings in these improvements were partially offset by a less profitable product mix 
segment margins improved to in from in corporate expenses increased to million in compared to million in corporate expenses in consisted of five months of goodrich headquarters expense allocations and seven months of our corporate expenses as an independent public company subsequent to the distribution 
the goodrich allocations were lower than our expenses have been as a public company 
asbestos related expenses of million in decreased from million in the expenses in included a million write off of an asbestos insurance receivable as a result of a bankruptcy filing by the parent company of one of garlock s insurers 
the remaining decrease is primarily the result of recoveries from insolvent insurance carriers in the total of net interest expense and distributions on tides decreased from million in to million in the decrease was primarily the result of the reduction in the coltec senior notes  which were retained by goodrich in connection with the distribution 
in  we purchased call options on goodrich common stock to provide protection against the risk that the cash required to finance conversions of the tides into goodrich common stock could exceed their liquidation value 
the call options are a derivative instrument and are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets 
changes in fair value are reflected in income  but do not affect cash flows 
the fair value of the call options increased in by million  compared to a loss of million in other expense in of million included the gain on a partial purchase of the tides  and a reserve adjustment for environmental matters  offset by amortization of debt issuance costs and charges associated with discontinued operations 
in connection with the distribution  the other expenses in of million included an increase in our environmental liabilities of million to reflect an increase in the estimated cost to remediate a number of environmental sites 
additionally  in we revised the estimated costs associated with an adverse court ruling related to severance owed as a result of the closing of a plant in we increased our retained liabilities of previously owned businesses for this case by million 
in december  million was paid in connection with this liability 
following is a discussion of the operating results for each segment 
sealing products 
sales increased in to million from million in foreign currency rates accounted for four percentage points of this increase in stemco contributed to the increase as a result of improved aftermarket activity and oem production order levels in the heavy duty truck market  which continues to improve from a low point in in addition  sales at garlock rubber technologies increased in due to increased volume 
sales at garlock sealing technologies were flat after excluding the effects of exchange rates 
plastomer technologies sales declined compared to due to the divestiture of two low margin product lines 
segment profit increased to million in compared to million in this increase was primarily a result of increased margins at stemco  cost reductions  and warranty and other unfavorable reserve adjustments in that did not recur in segment margins increased from in to in engineered products 
sales were million in  which was higher than the million in excluding the favorable foreign currency rates  sales at ggb  quincy compressor  france compressor products and haber sterling were essentially flat year over year 
in  segment profit decreased to million from million in excluding the impact of favorable foreign currency rates  segment profit at ggb  quincy compressor  france compressor products and haber sterling was down due to increased costs compared to segment margins decreased from in to in engine products and services 
sales decreased to million in compared to million in this decrease was mainly due to lower engine shipments by fairbanks morse engine to both commercial customers and the us navy 
field service revenue in was higher than  partially offset by lower demand for aftermarket parts 
segment profit increased to million in  compared to million in this increase was mainly due to positive events regarding a legal and warranty claim that led to the reduction of related accruals and lower restructuring expense 
segment margin improved to in compared to in restructuring and other costs restructuring expense was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the restructuring expense was primarily related to the relocation and consolidation of facilities for a domestic operation and start up costs associated with two new foreign facilities 
these activities are in support of our management initiatives to increase productivity and expand our product offerings in new geographic markets 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of restructuring and other costs in  and critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures pertaining to contingent assets and liabilities 
note  overview  basis of presentation and significant accounting policies  in the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  pensions and other post retirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are the most critical because some of them involve significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized at the time title and risk of product ownership is transferred or when services are rendered 
any shipping costs billed to customers are recognized as revenue 
asbestos historically  we recorded an accrual for asbestos related claims for actions in advanced stages of processing and settled claims only 
no accrual was recorded for claims in early procedural stages or for unasserted claims 
in  we established an accrual for early stage and unasserted claims estimated for a future period over which management believes the liability can reasonably be estimated 
we have engaged the firm of bates white  llc  a recognized expert in the field of estimating asbestos related liabilities  to assist us in estimating the liability 
due to the uncertain nature of the estimated liability  management s estimate covers a range  and we believe no single amount in the range is a better estimate than any other amount in the range 
in accordance with the applicable accounting rules  we recorded a liability for these claims and a corresponding receivable from our insurance carrier  at the lower end of the range of estimated potential liability 
the significant assumptions underlying the material components of the estimated range of liability include the number and trend of claims to be asserted  the mix of alleged diseases or impairment  the trend in the number of claims for non malignant cases  the probability that some existing and potential future claims will eventually be dismissed without payment  and the estimated amount to be paid per claim 
the actual number of future actions filed per year and the payments made to resolve those claims could exceed those reflected in our past experience and those reflected in our estimate 
with the assistance of bates white  llc  we will periodically review the period over which we can make a reasonable estimate  the assumptions underlying our estimate  and the range of reasonably possible potential liabilities  and adjust the liability if necessary 
changing circumstances and new data that may become available could cause a change in the obligation in the future by an amount that cannot currently be reasonably estimated  and that increase could be significant and material 
if the amount of the estimated liability ever exceeds the amount of insurance available for asbestos claims  the excess will be charged to earnings 
tides  derivative instruments and hedging activities upon the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we elected not to apply the provisions of the statement to embedded derivatives existing before january   as permitted by the transition provisions of the statement 
as a result  the feature of the tides that allows them to be converted into goodrich common stock is not accounted for separately as a derivative 
we purchased call options on shares of goodrich common stock with an exercise price of per share the conversion price  in an amount that would be required if all tides holders convert 
the call options provide for either an adjustment to the exercise price or a cash payment  at our option  if there is a change in the cash dividends paid on goodrich common stock 
the value of the call options as of december  is million and is reported in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
we also have entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge forecasted transactions occurring at various dates through december that are denominated in foreign currencies 
these contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges 
as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the contracts is reported in other comprehensive income loss and the ineffective portion is reported in income 
amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are reclassified into income in the period that the hedged transactions affect earnings 
pensions and post retirement benefits we and certain of our subsidiaries sponsor domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans 
major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of increase in employee compensation levels and assumed health care cost trend rates 
assumptions are determined based on data available to us and appropriate market indicators  and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date 
a change in any of these assumptions could have a material effect on net periodic pension and post retirement benefit costs reported in the consolidated statements of operations  as well as amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of pension and post retirement benefits 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
temporary differences arising from the difference between the tax and book basis of an asset or liability are used to compute future tax assets or liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income losses in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
new accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements  including the respective expected dates of adoption  and the effects on results of operations  cash flows and financial condition  if any 
liquidity and capital resources operating cash flows operating activities provided million and million in and  respectively  and million in this includes a working capital increase of million in  compared to a decrease of million in and a decrease of million in the increase in working capital was the result of increased sales and manufacturing activity in  when compared to additionally  payments for asbestos related claims settlements  net of insurance proceeds  during were million compared to million in and million in in we received a payment of approximately million pertaining to the resolution of the dispute with one of our london based insurance carriers  equitas  on delinquent asbestos related insurance receivables 
however  net asbestos payments in were negatively impacted by a dispute between garlock and its other london market carriers over documentation requirements and settlement standards 
this dispute has since been resolved and  as a result  we received payment of million of delinquent proceeds in the first quarter of we are currently appealing several significant adverse asbestos verdicts 
in some cases  the appeals will require the provision of security in the form of an appeal bond  potentially in amounts greater than the verdicts 
we are required to provide cash collateral to secure the full amount of the bonds  which will restrict the usage of a significant amount of our cash for the entire periods of such appeals 
the length of time for appeals can vary  and could be as long as two or three years 
for example  in los angeles  we have posted a bond in the amount of million to stay enforcement of a million verdict 
we are confident that we will prevail in the appeals  particularly on the issue of punitive damages 
however  there can be no assurance that any or all of the appeals will be successful 
asbestos related expenditures and the associated insurance is discussed further under contingencies asbestos  included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
investing cash flows we used million  million and million in investing activities in  and  respectively 
our recurring investing activities in primarily relate to capital expenditures of million associated with our manufacturing facilities  compared to million in and million in in we received proceeds of million primarily from the sale of a surplus building and the divesture of our haber tool and sterling die businesses 
in  we used million of cash to acquire the pikotek business and a small specialty sealing product line 
in  we purchased call options on goodrich common stock for cash payments totaling million to provide protection against the risk that the cash required to finance conversions of the tides could exceed the tides liquidation value 
the increase in capital expenditures in each year reflects our strategy to increase investments in our operations aimed at improving customer satisfaction  cost reductions and restructuring our operations 
financing cash flows financing activities used million in  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million and million in and  respectively 
financing cash flows in were impacted primarily by the repayment of certain industrial revenue bonds 
financing cash flows in were limited mainly to a partial purchase of the tides for approximately million in cash  and a million borrowing against a promissory note to purchase life insurance policies in connection with certain pre retirement death benefits for our executive officers 
the borrowing did not involve any cash inflows because we recorded a corresponding increase in cash surrender value that is reflected in operating cash flows 
prior to the distribution in  our cash disbursements and cash receipts were managed in a corporate cash concentration system 
we describe this activity as net transfers to from goodrich in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
under this process  goodrich provided million of cash in that was used primarily to fund operating cash requirements  including asbestos related expenditures  capital expenditures  a portion of the call options paid prior to the distribution  and to increase our cash balance as of the date of the distribution 
capital resources our primary us subsidiaries executed a credit agreement dated may   for a senior secured revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the senior secured revolving credit facility would be collateralized by receivables  inventories  equipment  intellectual property  insurance receivables and all other personal property assets of enpro and its us subsidiaries and by a pledge of of the capital stock of their direct foreign subsidiaries 
the maximum available amount under the facility is million 
we have not borrowed against this credit facility 
coltec has outstanding approximately million of tides due april  the tides are convertible at the option of the holder into a combination of of a share of goodrich common stock and of a share of enpro common stock 
should the holders exercise their right to convert the tides  coltec would be required to deliver shares of goodrich and enpro common stock to the holders as promptly as practicable after the conversion date 
the value of goodrich and enpro common stock may increase to a level where coltec s cost to acquire shares in a conversion could exceed  with no maximum  the million aggregate liquidation value 
coltec has purchased call options on shares of goodrich common stock with an exercise price of per share the conversion price  in an amount that would be required if all tides holders convert 
until they expire in march  the call options provide protection against the risk that the cash required to finance conversions of the tides could exceed the tides liquidation value 
the call options are derivative instruments and are carried at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets with changes in the fair value reflected currently in our earnings 
such changes may have a material effect on our results of operations in a given period  but will not result in any cash obligation 
while we have hedged our exposure to conversion costs in excess of the aggregate liquidation value of the tides as described earlier  we cannot assure you that we will have the financial resources to redeem these securities or effectively hedge this exposure beyond the term of the call options 
in  we paid an industrial revenue bond in the face amount of million that was collateralized by a building sold in december under the terms of the bond agreement  we were required to pay the bond within days of closing the sale 
goodrich offered to exchange new goodrich debt securities for outstanding coltec senior notes prior to the distribution 
goodrich acquired million of coltec senior notes tendered pursuant to the offer 
the million of coltec senior notes that remained outstanding following completion of the exchange offer continue to be obligations of coltec 
dividends the terms of the senior secured revolving credit facility as well as the terms of the tides impact directly or indirectly our ability to pay dividends 
the senior secured revolving credit facility contains limitations on dividend payments 
in connection with the tides  coltec is entitled to withhold interest payments to coltec capital trust for up to quarters 
if these interest payments are withheld  coltec would be unable to pay dividends to enpro  which could limit our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders during this period 
contingencies general various claims  lawsuits and administrative proceedings  all arising in the ordinary course of business with respect to commercial  product liability  asbestos and environmental matters  are pending or threatened against enpro or its subsidiaries and seek monetary damages or other remedies 
we believe that any liability that may finally be determined with respect to commercial and non asbestos product liability claims should not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
from time to time  we and our subsidiaries are also involved as plaintiffs in legal proceedings involving contract  patent protection  environmental and other matters 
environmental our facilities and operations are subject to federal  state and local environmental and occupational health and safety requirements of the us and foreign countries 
we take a proactive approach to ensure compliance with all environmental  health and safety laws as they relate to our manufacturing operations and in proposing and implementing any remedial plans that may be necessary 
we also conduct comprehensive compliance and management system audits at our facilities to maintain compliance and improve operational efficiency 
although we believe that past operations were in substantial compliance with the then applicable regulations  we or one of our subsidiaries have been notified that we are  or it is  among the potentially responsible parties for the cost of investigating and  in some cases  remediating contamination at sites at which the costs are expected to exceed thousand at each site 
the majority of these sites relate to remediation projects at former operating facilities that were sold or closed and primarily deal with soil and groundwater remediation 
investigations have been completed for sites and are in progress at four sites 
the laws governing investigation and remediation of these sites can impose joint and several liability for the associated costs 
liability for these costs can be imposed on present and former owners or operators of the properties or on parties that generated the wastes that contributed to the contamination 
our policy is to accrue environmental investigation and remediation costs when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the measurement of the liability is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual situation and takes into consideration factors such as existing technology  presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites 
liabilities are established for all sites based on the factors discussed above 
as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites  these liabilities are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical data and legal information 
as of december  and  we had an accrued liability of million and million  respectively  for estimated future expenditures relating to environmental contingencies 
of this amount  million represents our share of liability as a potentially responsible party at a former industrial property located in farmingdale  new york 
the amounts recorded in the condensed consolidated financial statements have been recorded on an undiscounted basis 
cash outflows for environmental remediation have been less than million during each of the years  and we believe that our reserves are adequate based on currently available information 
actual costs to be incurred for identified situations in future periods may vary from estimates because of the inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures due to unknown conditions  changing government regulations and legal standards regarding liability 
subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs  we believe that maintaining compliance with current environmental laws and government regulations will not require significant capital expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or cash flows  but could be material to our results of operations in a given period 
colt firearms and central moloney we have contingent liabilities related to divested businesses for which certain of our subsidiaries retained liability or are obligated under indemnity agreements 
these contingent liabilities include  but are not limited to  potential product liability and associated claims related to coltec s former colt firearms subsidiary for firearms manufactured prior to its divestiture in and coltec s former central moloney subsidiary for electrical transformers manufactured prior to its divestiture in no material product liability claims are currently pending against coltec related to colt firearms or central moloney 
colt firearms has been named as a defendant in cases filed by municipalities seeking to recover costs arising from gun related injuries 
many of those cases have been dismissed or are inactive 
the current owner of colt firearms is seeking indemnification from coltec for these claims to the extent they involve firearms manufactured prior to march we have rejected colt firearms claims for indemnification relating to the municipal gun cases in all instances on various legal grounds 
as a result  colt firearms has filed a lawsuit in new york state court seeking reimbursement of costs incurred in defending municipal cases 
coltec also has ongoing obligations  which are included in retained liabilities of previously owned businesses in our condensed consolidated balance sheets  with regard to workers compensation  retiree medical and other retiree benefit matters that relate to coltec s periods of ownership of these operations 
crucible materials corporation through our coltec subsidiary  we owned approximately of the outstanding common stock of crucible materials corporation crucible up until its sale in october crucible  which is engaged primarily in the manufacture and distribution of high technology specialty metal products  was a wholly owned subsidiary of coltec until coltec sold the crucible common shares that it owned to crucible  and thus coltec no longer has any ownership interest in crucible 
no gain or loss was recorded on the sale 
in conjunction with the closure of a crucible plant in the early s  coltec was required to fund two irrevocable trusts for retiree medical benefits for union employees at the plant 
the first trust the benefits trust pays for these retiree medical benefits on an ongoing basis 
coltec has no continuing connection to the benefits trust  and thus the assets and liabilities of this trust are not included in our condensed consolidated balance sheets 
under the terms of the benefits trust agreement  the trustees retained an actuary to assess the adequacy of the assets in the benefits trust in  and another actuarial report will be required in and if  at either or both of the future valuation dates  it is determined that the trust assets are not adequate to fund the payment of future medical benefits  coltec will be required to contribute additional amounts 
based on preliminary information  an additional contribution in is not anticipated 
in the event there are ever excess assets in the benefits trust  those excess assets will not revert to coltec 
because of the possibility of future contributions to the benefits trust  coltec was required to establish a second trust the back up trust to cover potential shortfalls in the benefits trust 
the assets and a corresponding liability of the back up trust are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets in other non current assets and in retained liabilities of previously owned businesses  respectively  and amounted to million each at december  if the actuary determines that there are excess assets in the back up trust at the benefits trust valuation dates in and  the excess assets will revert to coltec based on a distribution formula and will be recorded in income upon receipt 
until such time as payments are required or excess assets revert to coltec  the assets and liability are kept equal to each other 
coltec also has ongoing obligations  which are included in retained liabilities of previously owned businesses in the condensed consolidated balance sheets  with regard to workers compensation  retiree medical and other retiree benefit matters  in addition to those mentioned previously  that relate to its period of ownership of crucible 
debt and capital lease guarantees as of december   we had contingent liabilities for potential payments on guarantees of certain debt and lease obligations totaling million 
these guarantees arose from the divestiture of crucible  central moloney and haber  and expire at various dates through there is no liability for these guarantees reflected in our condensed consolidated balance sheets 
in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the debt or lease agreements  we could be responsible for these obligations 
asbestos history 
certain of coltec s subsidiaries  primarily garlock sealing technologies llc garlock and the anchor packing company anchor  are among a large number of defendants in actions filed in various states by plaintiffs alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos fibers 
among the products at issue in these actions are industrial sealing products  predominantly gaskets and packing products 
the damages claimed vary from action to action  and in some cases plaintiffs seek both compensatory and punitive damages 
to date  neither garlock nor anchor has been required to pay any punitive damage awards  although there can be no assurance that they will not be required to do so in the future 
liability for compensatory damages has historically been allocated among all responsible defendants 
since the first asbestos related lawsuits were filed against garlock in  garlock and anchor have processed more than  asbestos claims to conclusion including judgments  settlements and dismissals and  together with their insurers  have paid more than billion in settlements and judgments and approximately million in fees and expenses 
claims mix 
of those claims resolved  approximately have been claims of plaintiffs alleging the disease mesothelioma  approximately have been claims of plaintiffs with lung or other cancers  and more than have been claims of plaintiffs alleging asbestosis  pleural plaques or other impairment of the respiratory system 
out of the  open cases at december   we are aware of only approximately  that involve a claimant with mesothelioma  lung cancer or some other cancer 
product defenses 
the asbestos containing products formerly sold by garlock and anchor were encapsulated  which means the asbestos fibers were incorporated into the product during the manufacturing process and sealed in a binder 
they were also nonfriable  which means they could not be crumbled by hand pressure 
the us occupational safety and health administration  which began generally requiring warnings on asbestos containing products in  has never required that a warning be placed on products such as garlock s gaskets 
even though no warning label was required  garlock included one on all of its asbestos containing products beginning in further  gaskets such as those previously manufactured and sold by garlock are one of the few asbestos containing products still permitted to be manufactured under regulations of the environmental protection agency 
garlock discontinued distributing asbestos containing products in the us during and worldwide in mid from the mid s until  us sales of asbestos containing industrial sealing products were not a material part of garlock s sales  and its sales of asbestos containing products were predominantly to sophisticated purchasers such as the us navy and large petrochemical facilities 
these purchasers generally have extensive health and safety procedures and are familiar with the risks associated with the use and handling of industrial sealing products that contain asbestos 
garlock s product defenses have enabled it to be successful at trial  winning defense verdicts in four of five cases tried to verdict in  and receiving defense verdicts in five of eleven cases decided in in the successful jury trials  the juries determined that garlock s products were not defective and that garlock was not negligent 
in the cases decided by judges  the judges determined that the claimant failed to make a sufficient showing of exposure to garlock s products 
recent trial results 
during  garlock began seventeen trials involving twenty plaintiffs 
verdicts were rendered against garlock in six cases 
garlock won defense verdicts with respect to three plaintiffs in two trials and the judge directed verdicts in favor of garlock in two cases 
there were two trials started in another case  both of which resulted in mistrials 
seven cases were settled during trial  and another case resulted in a hung jury 
an el paso  texas jury awarded a deceased year old pipe fitter million in compensatory damages in april  allocating to garlock a share  and million in punitive damages 
in november  the trial court ruled that garlock was entitled to a set off for settlements collected from other defendants 
the set off exceeded the compensatory and punitive damage awards 
as a result  the trial judge determined that garlock owed no money on this award and did not enter a punitive damage judgment 
in may  a baltimore jury returned a verdict against garlock and two other defendants  assessing a one third share to each  in favor of a year old boiler technician who died from mesothelioma 
a judgment of million was entered against garlock 
in october  a los angeles jury returned a verdict that included an award of million compensatory damages and million punitive damages against garlock in a case involving a year old machinist with mesothelioma 
in november  a jury in niagara falls  new york returned a verdict of million against garlock and one other defendant in a case involving a year old maintenance mechanic with mesothelioma 
the jury assessed liability against garlock and against the other defendant 
garlock is entitled to set offs and  as a result  garlock s share of the verdict is approximately million 
garlock s share of each of the other two verdicts one in cass county  texas  and the other in newport news  virginia  after applicable set offs and credits  will be less than  garlock is appealing each of the significant adverse verdicts against it 
in some cases  particularly in respect of the los angeles verdict  such appeals will require the provision of security in the form of an appeal bond  potentially in amounts greater than the verdicts 
we are required to provide cash collateral to secure the full amount of the bonds  which will restrict the usage of a significant amount of our cash for the entire periods of such appeals 
the length of time for appeals can vary  and could be as long as two or three years 
for example  in los angeles we have posted a bond in the amount of million to stay enforcement of the million verdict 
we are confident that garlock will prevail in the appeals  particularly on the issue of punitive damages 
garlock has a track record of success in a majority of its previous appeals 
however  there can be no assurance that any or all of garlock s appeals will be successful 
settlements 
garlock settles and disposes of actions on a regular basis 
garlock s historical settlement strategy has been to try to match the timing of payments with recoveries received from insurance  which are limited by agreement to an annual amount that is currently set at million per year million per quarter 
that limit increases every three years by  and the next scheduled increase will take effect in the third quarter of in and  garlock implemented a short term aggressive settlement strategy 
the purpose of this short term strategy was to achieve a permanent reduction in the number of overall asbestos claims through the settlement of a larger than normal number of claims  including some claims not yet filed as lawsuits 
due to this short term aggressive settlement strategy and a significant overall increase in claims filings  the settlement amounts paid in each of the years through were greater than the amounts paid in any year prior to in  garlock resumed its historical settlement strategy 
in fact  garlock reduced new settlement commitments from million in  to million in  million in  million in  and million in because many of the commitments made in  and early are being paid over a number of years  the settlement amounts that garlock will pay in will continue to include some amounts for those settlements  but those amounts will be smaller than in recent years 
settlements are made without any admission of liability 
settlement amounts vary depending upon a number of factors  including the jurisdiction where the action was brought  the nature and extent of the disease alleged and the associated medical evidence  the age and occupation of the plaintiff  the presence or absence of other possible causes of the plaintiff s alleged illness  the availability of legal defenses  and whether the action is an individual one or part of a group 
before any payment on a settled claim is made  the claimant is required to submit a medical report acceptable to garlock substantiating the asbestos related illness and meeting specific criteria of disability 
in addition  sworn testimony or other evidence that the claimant worked with or around garlock asbestos containing products is required 
the claimant is also required to sign a full and unconditional release of garlock  its subsidiaries  parent  officers  directors  affiliates and related parties from any liability for asbestos related injuries or claims 
status of anchor 
anchor is an inactive and insolvent indirect subsidiary of coltec 
there is no remaining insurance coverage available to anchor 
anchor has not committed to settle any actions since as cases reach the trial stage  anchor is typically dismissed without payment 
insurance coverage 
in the second quarter of  we reached agreement with equitas  the london based entity responsible for the pre lloyds of london policies in our insurance block  concerning the settlement of its exposure to our subsidiaries asbestos claims 
as a result of the settlement  garlock received million in payment of receivables in the third quarter of  and another million was placed in an independent trust 
the funds in the trust are available to pay the equitas share of future claims and the trust is billed monthly for that share  just as equitas was billed 
as a result of that agreement  the million of payments made by equitas commuted million of total nominal coverage 
the million difference reflects discounting for present value and for the equitas solvency risk 
we expect a portion of the discounted amount to be recoverable from after tax earnings on the trust assets 
at december   the market value of the funds remaining in the trust was approximately million 
in the fourth quarter of  we reached agreement with a group of london market carriers other than equitas and one of our us carriers that has some policies reinsured through the london market 
as a result of the settlement  which resolved a pending arbitration among the parties  in january garlock received million in payment of receivables and another million was placed in an independent trust 
as part of the settlement  garlock received another million from an insolvent london carrier in february of the funds in the trust are available to pay the london carriers share of future claims and the trust will be billed monthly for that share  just as the carriers were billed 
the million of payments commuted million of total nominal coverage 
the million difference reflects discounting for present value and for solvency and litigation risks 
as with the equitas trust  we expect a portion of the discounted amount to be recoverable from after tax earnings on the trust assets 
the million paid to garlock in january by the london market carriers under the settlement agreement consists of approximately million of the million due under the cap agreement in as a result  garlock had higher asbestos cash outflows in than in however  had the million been received in  garlock s net cash outflow for all asbestos related claims and expenses would have been significantly less than the million net cash outflow in as of december   after factoring in the amounts placed in trust as a result of the equitas and london market settlements  garlock had available million of insurance and trust coverage that we believe will be available to cover future claim and expense payments 
in addition  garlock classifies million of otherwise available insurance as insolvent 
we believe garlock will recover some of the insolvent insurance over time 
in fact  garlock recovered million from insolvent carriers during  million during  and million during of the million of collectible insurance and trust assets  we consider million to be high quality because it is a with us based carriers whose credit rating by s p is investment grade bbb or better  and whose am best rating is excellent a or better million  b in the equitas trust million  c in the london trust million  or d london insurance settlement payments million already made 
we consider million to be of moderate quality because it is with a other solvent us carriers who are unrated or below investment grade million or b with various other london market carriers million 
of the million  million is allocated to claims that have been paid by garlock and submitted to its insurance companies for reimbursement and million is allocated to our estimated liability for future payments 
thus  as of december   million remains available for additional future asbestos related settlements 
arrangements with garlock s insurance carriers limit the amount of insurance proceeds that it is entitled to receive in any one year 
the amount of insurance available to cover asbestos related payments by garlock is currently limited to million per year million per quarter 
because garlock from time to time collects some insolvent insurance and because some of garlock s carriers pay as if there were no annual limit  garlock receives amounts in excess of the limit in some periods 
amounts paid by garlock in excess of insurance recoveries in any year that would be recoverable from insurance if there was no annual limit may be collected from the insurance companies in subsequent years so long as insurance is available  subject to the annual limit available in each subsequent year 
to the extent that garlock pays such amounts in a given year  these payments are recorded as a receivable 
in november  coltec received a letter and arbitration demand from one of its us based investment grade insurers claiming that the insurer was relieved of liability on a million coltec policy in connection with a settlement and payment in full by a related insurer of a million anchor policy 
that insurer filed suit against coltec in state court in new york in november  making the same and other claims  and coltec filed coverage litigation against the insurer in federal court in pennsylvania in december coltec intends to vigorously pursue the insurance coverage 
the million policy is included in garlock s million remaining collectible coverage 
insurance coverage for asbestos claims is not available to cover exposures initially occurring on and after july  garlock and anchor continue to be named as defendants in new actions  a few of which allege initial exposure after july  to date  no payments have been made with respect to these claims  pursuant to a settlement or otherwise 
in addition  garlock and anchor believe that they have substantial defenses to these claims and therefore automatically reject them for settlement 
however  there can be no assurance that any or all of these defenses will be successful in the future 
quantitative claims information 
due to their uncertain nature  management s estimate of the liability for early stage and unasserted claims covers a range of possible values  and we believe that no single amount in the range is a better estimate than any other amount in the range 
therefore  in accordance with applicable accounting rules  we recorded a liability at december   for million  million for advanced stage cases and settled claims and million for early stage and future claims 
we also recorded a corresponding receivable from our insurance carriers 
the recorded amount for early stage and unasserted claims is at the low end of the range of what we believe to be reasonably possible 
our outside counsel retained the expert claims valuation firm bates white  llc  to review garlock s product history  historical claims information and settlement experience and to assist and advise in connection with the management of garlock asbestos claims and our estimation of garlock s liability for pending and reasonably estimable unasserted future asbestos claims 
we received an opinion from bates white dated february   to the effect that  based on the range of events likely to transpire in the future  which are reasonably predicted for garlock s non malignant claims through and for garlock s cancer claims through  the reasonable and probable estimate of garlock s obligation for asbestos personal injury claims ranges from million to million 
we have adopted the range predicted by our expert  however we note that bates white also indicated the calculation of other potential estimates of garlock s future obligation for the period of the estimation that ranged from million to million 
we caution that points within that broader range remain possible outcomes 
also  while we agree with our expert that beyond for garlock non malignant claims and beyond for garlock cancer claims  there are reasonable scenarios in which the 
asbestos 
expenditure is de minimus  we caution that the process of estimating future liabilities is highly uncertain 
in the words of the bates white report  the reliability of such estimates declines significantly for each year further into the future 
plausible scenarios exist that could result in a total remaining asbestos liability for garlock in excess of billion  consistent with the high end of management s estimates provided in the previous two quarters 
the recording of a liability for early stage and unasserted claims does not alter our strategy for managing potential asbestos liabilities and insurance assets and has no impact on the ultimate amount paid for asbestos related claims against our subsidiaries 
however  the recording of that liability could  at some time in the future  accelerate the timing of the recognition of charges to income for future asbestos claims 
that would happen in the event the amount of the low end of our estimate of the liability for pending and unasserted claims increases to the point where it  when combined with the amount of insurance receivables that we have recorded  exceeds the total remaining amount of insurance we have available for the payment of such claims 
the table below quantitatively depicts the liability described above and the amount that we expect garlock to recover from insurance related to this liability 
as of and for the year ended december  number of cases new actions filed during the period open actions at period end dollars in millions at period end estimated amounts recoverable from insurance estimated liability for settled claims and actions in advanced stages of processing estimated liability for early stage and unasserted cases dollars in millions payments insurance recoveries net cash flows consists only of actions actually filed with a court of competent jurisdiction 
each action in which both garlock and anchor are named as a defendant is shown as a single action 
multiple actions filed by the same plaintiff in more than one jurisdiction are also counted as one action 
claims not filed as an action in court that were received and paid as part of inventory settlements approximately  in   in  and  in are not included 
at december   the amount included million representing cumulative payments made for which garlock has not received a corresponding insurance recovery in part due to the annual limit imposed under garlock s insurance agreement and in part due to the dispute with its london market insurers 
also included at december   is million representing amounts recoverable under insurance policies related to the estimated liability for settled claims  actions in advanced stages of processing  and for early stage and unasserted claims 
at december   we classified million as a current asset and million as a non current asset in our consolidated balance sheets 
includes amounts with respect to the estimated liability for settled claims and actions in advanced stages of processing  whether or not an action has actually been filed with a court of competent jurisdiction 
at december   we classified million as a current liability and million as a non current liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
includes an estimate of potential liabilities for early stage cases and unasserted claims likely to be filed against garlock in the future 
the amount reflects the low end of an estimated range of potential liabilities  and we caution that future asbestos liabilities remain highly uncertain 
at december   we classified this amount as a non current liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
includes amounts with respect to all payments for claims settlements and expenses and recoveries made in the period 
at december   and  we added million  million and million  respectively  of the net cash flows to the asbestos insurance receivable in the condensed consolidated balance sheets  and we recorded million  million and million  respectively  as an expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
this expense relates primarily to uninsured legal fees and administrative costs net of recoveries from insolvent insurance carriers 
new filings 
as shown in the table  the number of new actions filed against our subsidiaries in was much lower than the number in  compared to  and the lowest for any twelve month period since the early s 
in fact  new filings have been significantly lower for the past six quarters than in the previous quarters of through declining incidence of disease is but one possible factor in the decline 
other factors include  but are not limited to  tort reform in some high profile states  especially mississippi and texas  actions taken and rulings by some judges and court administrators that have the effect of limiting access to their courts for claimants without sufficient ties to the jurisdiction or claimants with no discernible disease  acceleration of current year claims into past years  and uncertainty about the potential for national asbestos reform legislation 
strategy 
garlock s current strategy is to focus on trial listed cases and other cases in advanced stages of processing  to reduce new settlement commitments each year  to carefully manage and maximize insurance collections  and to proactively support legislative and other efforts aimed at asbestos reform 
garlock believes that this strategy should result in the reduction of the negative annual cash flow impact from asbestos claims  as previous settlements work their way through the payment process 
garlock believes that  as predicted in various epidemiological studies that are publicly available  the incidence of asbestos related disease is in decline and should continue to decline steadily over the next decade and thereafter  so that the level of claims activity against garlock will eventually decline to a level that can be paid from the cash flow expected from garlock s operations if garlock exhausts its insurance coverage 
there can be no assurance that epidemiological predictions about incidence of asbestos related disease will prove to be accurate  or that  even if they are  there will be a commensurate decline in the number of asbestos related claims filings 
considering the foregoing  as well as the experience of coltec s subsidiaries and other defendants in asbestos litigation  the likely sharing of judgments among multiple responsible defendants  recent bankruptcies of other defendants  and legislative efforts  and given the amount of insurance coverage that garlock expects to be available from its solvent carriers  we believe that pending actions against garlock and anchor are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  but could be material to our results of operations or cash flows in a given period 
we anticipate that asbestos related actions will continue to be filed against garlock 
because of the uncertainty as to the number and timing of potential future actions  as well as the amount that will have to be paid to settle or satisfy any such actions in the future and the finite amount of insurance available for future payments  those future actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
reform legislation 
the outlook for federal legislation to provide national asbestos litigation reform continues to be uncertain 
we are supportive generally of proposed legislation that would set up a national trust fund as the exclusive means for the recovery of asbestos related claims 
we are not certain as to what contributions we would be required to make to such a fund  although we anticipate that they would be substantial and that they would continue for a significant number of years 
while we are cautiously optimistic that reform legislation ultimately will be adopted by the us congress  there is no assurance that proposed legislation currently under consideration by the senate or any other asbestos legislation will ultimately become law 
off balance sheet arrangements lease agreements we have several operating leases primarily for real estate  equipment and vehicles 
operating lease arrangements are generally utilized to secure the use of assets from time to time if the terms and conditions of the lease or the nature of the asset makes the lease arrangement more favorable than a purchase 
as of december   approximately million of future minimum lease payments were outstanding under these agreements 
see note  commitments and contingencies other commitments  in the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure 
debt and capital lease guarantees at december   we have outstanding contingent liabilities for guaranteed debt and lease payments of million related to previously divested businesses 
contractual obligations a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments at december   is as follows payments due by period in millions contractual less than more than obligations total year years years years long term debt operating leases other long term liabilities total payments for other long term liabilities are estimates of amounts that will be paid for environmental and retained liabilities of previously owned businesses included in the consolidated balance sheets at december  these estimated payments are based on information currently known to us 
however  it is possible that these estimates will vary from actual results if new information becomes available in the future or if there are changes in the facts and circumstances related to these liabilities 
additional discussion regarding these liabilities is included earlier in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in contingencies environmental  other contingent liability matters  and in note in the consolidated financial statements 
outlook we continue to make progress in connection with our strategy to improve operating efficiency through our tcv initiative  to expand our product offerings and customer base  to strengthen the mix of our businesses  and to manage asbestos settlements by our subsidiaries 
our strong liquidity  cash flows and relatively low leverage ratio provide us with a sound financial base upon which we can build a stronger enpro 
we expect sales to increase in compared to  mainly due to improved volumes as our markets have shown signs of improvement  price increases and increased market share as a result of new products 
higher sales volumes  the benefits of our tcv lean manufacturing and restructuring initiatives and price increases are expected to result in improved operating margins and increased profitability in however  we are evaluating options for a substantial investment to upgrade a principal sealing products manufacturing facility that could result in restructuring expense in and for several years thereafter 
we anticipate that cash flows in will benefit from lower net asbestos payments and improved operating income 
capital spending in is expected to be comparable to levels as a result of continued investments to improve operational efficiency  cost reductions and new product development efforts 
as part of our operating strategy to strengthen our mix of businesses  we will continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions and divestitures in  however  the impact of such acquisitions or divestitures cannot be predicted and therefore is not reflected in this outlook 
certain risk factors that may affect future results in addition to the risks stated elsewhere in this annual report  set forth below are certain risk factors that we believe are material to our shareholders 
if any of these risks occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and reputation could be harmed 
you should also consider these risk factors when you read forward looking statements elsewhere in this report 
you can identify forward looking statements by terms such as may  hope  will  should  expect  plan  anticipate  intend  believe  estimate  predict  or continue  the negative of those terms or other comparable terminology 
those forward looking statements are only predictions and can be adversely affected if any of these risks occur 
risks related to our business certain of our subsidiaries are defendants in asbestos litigation 
the historical business operations of certain coltec subsidiaries  principally garlock sealing technologies llc and the anchor packing company  have resulted in a substantial volume of asbestos litigation in which plaintiffs have alleged personal injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos fibers 
those subsidiaries manufactured and or sold industrial sealing products  predominately gaskets and packing products which contained encapsulated asbestos fibers 
anchor is an inactive and insolvent indirect subsidiary of coltec 
there is no remaining insurance coverage available to anchor 
our subsidiaries exposure to asbestos litigation and their relationships with insurance carriers are actively managed through another coltec subsidiary  garrison litigation management group  ltd 
several risks and uncertainties may result in potential liabilities to us in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
those risks and uncertainties include the following the potential for a large volume of future asbestos claims to the extent such claims are not covered by insurance because insurance coverage is  or will be  depleted  the uncertainty of the per claim value of pending and potential future asbestos claims  the timing of payout of claims relative to recoveries of amounts covered by insurance from our subsidiaries insurance carriers and limitations imposed on the amount that may be recovered in any given year  the financial viability of our subsidiaries insurance carriers and their reinsurance carriers  and our subsidiaries ability to collect on claims from them  an increase in litigation or other costs that are not covered by insurance  the unavailability of any insurance for claims alleging first exposure to asbestos after july   bankruptcies of other defendants  and the results of litigation 
potential liability for asbestos claims may adversely affect our ability to retain and attract customers and quality personnel 
to the extent our subsidiaries insurance is depleted or the payments required in any given year exceed the annual limitations on insurance recoveries from our subsidiaries carriers  our subsidiaries would be required to fund these obligations from available cash  even if such amounts are recoverable under these insurance policies in later years 
this could adversely affect our ability to use cash for other purposes  including growth of our business  and adversely affect our financial condition 
in addition  our estimated liability for early stage and potential future asbestos claims that may be received  which is highly uncertain  is based on subjective assumptions and is at the low end of a range of possible values 
the actual liability could vary significantly from the estimate provided 
our business and some of the markets we serve are cyclical and changes in general market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the markets in which we sell our products  particularly chemical companies  petroleum refineries and the automotive industry  are  to varying degrees  cyclical and have historically experienced periodic downturns 
prior downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  excess manufacturing capacity and subsequent erosion of average selling prices in these markets resulting in negative effects on our net sales  gross margins and net income 
economic downturns or other material weakness in demand in any of these markets could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we face intense competition that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we encounter intense competition in almost all areas of our business 
additionally  customers for many of our products are attempting to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase in order to reduce inventories 
to remain competitive  we need to invest continuously in manufacturing  marketing  customer service and support and our distribution networks 
we may not have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or maintain our competitive position 
additionally  some of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater financial resources than we do 
as a result  they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns 
pricing and other competitive pressures could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely to market our products  we may be unable to effectively market our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 
our marketing success in the us and abroad depends largely upon our independent agents and distributors sales and service expertise and relationships with customers in our markets 
many of these agents have developed strong ties to existing and potential customers because of their detailed knowledge of our products 
a loss of a significant number of these agents or distributors  or of a particular agent or distributor in a key market or with key customer relationships  could significantly inhibit our ability to effectively market our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
increased costs for raw materials or the termination of existing supply agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our businesses rely on stable prices for energy  steel and other raw materials  the prices for which increased dramatically in while we have been successful in passing along a portion of these higher costs  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue doing so without losing customers 
similarly  the loss of a key supplier could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we have exposure to some contingent liabilities relating to discontinued operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows in any fiscal period 
we have some contingent liabilities related to discontinued operations of our predecessors  including environmental liabilities and liabilities for certain products and other matters 
in some instances  we have indemnified others against those liabilities  and in other instances  we have received indemnities from third parties against those liabilities 
under federal and state environmental laws  coltec or one of its subsidiaries has been named as a potentially responsible party at sites at each of which the costs to it are expected to exceed thousand 
investigations have been completed or are near completion for of these sites and are in progress at the other four sites 
the majority of these sites relate to remediation projects at former operating facilities that have been sold or closed and primarily deal with soil and groundwater contamination 
we believe that any liability incurred for cleanup at these sites will be satisfied over a number of years  and  in some cases  the costs will be shared with other potentially responsible parties 
claims could arise relating to products or other matters related to our discontinued operations 
some of these claims could seek substantial monetary damages 
specifically  we may potentially be subject to the liabilities related to the firearms manufactured prior to by colt firearms  a former operation of coltec  and for electrical transformers manufactured prior to by central maloney  another former coltec operation 
coltec also has ongoing obligations with regard to workers compensation  retiree medical and other retiree benefit matters associated with discontinued operations that relate to coltec s periods of ownership of those operations 
we have insurance  reserves and funds held in trust to address these liabilities 
however  if our insurance coverage is depleted  our reserves are not adequate or the funds held in trust are insufficient  environmental and other liabilities relating to discontinued operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we conduct a significant amount of our sales activities outside of the us  which subjects us to additional business risks that may cause our profitability to decline 
because we sell our products in a number of foreign countries  we are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
in  we derived approximately of our revenues from sales of our products outside of the us our international operations are  and will continue to be  subject to a number of risks  including unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  adverse changes in foreign tax  legal and regulatory requirements  difficulty in protecting intellectual property  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  differing labor regulations  political and economic instability  and acts of hostility  terror or war 
any of these factors  individually or together  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we intend to continue to pursue international growth opportunities  which could increase our exposure to risks associated with international sales and operations 
as we expand our international operations  we may also encounter new risks that could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
for example  as we focus on building our international sales and distribution networks in new geographic regions  we must continue to develop relationships with qualified local agents  distributors and trading companies 
if we are not successful in developing these relationships  we may not be able to increase sales in these regions 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights and knowledge relating to our products  our business and prospects may be negatively impacted 
we believe that proprietary products and technology are important to our success 
if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property and know how  our business and prospects could be negatively impacted 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property through patents  trademarks  service marks  domain names  trade secrets  copyrights  confidentiality  non compete and nondisclosure agreements and other measures may not be adequate to protect our proprietary rights 
patents issued to third parties  whether before or after the issue date of our patents  could render our intellectual property less valuable 
questions as to whether our competitors products infringe our intellectual property rights or whether our products infringe our competitors intellectual property rights may be disputed 
in addition  intellectual property rights may be unavailable  limited or difficult to enforce in some jurisdictions  which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share in those jurisdictions 
our competitors may capture market share from us by selling products that claim to mirror the capabilities of our products or technology without infringing upon our intellectual property rights 
without sufficient protection nationally and internationally for our intellectual property  our competitiveness worldwide could be impaired  which would negatively impact our growth and future revenue 
as a result  we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
risks related to ownership of our common stock the market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile 
a relatively small number of shares traded in any one day could have a significant affect on the market price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons  including in response to the risks described in this section and elsewhere in this report or for reasons unrelated to our operations  such as reports by industry analysts  investor perceptions or negative announcements by our customers  competitors or suppliers regarding their own performance  as well as industry conditions and general financial  economic and political instability 
in particular  reports concerning the possibility of national asbestos litigation reform could cause a significant increase or decrease in the market price of our common stock 
because our quarterly revenues and operating results may vary significantly in future periods  our stock price may fluctuate 
our revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
a high proportion of our costs are fixed  due in part to significant selling and manufacturing costs 
small declines in revenues could disproportionately affect operating results in a quarter and the price of our common stock may fall 
other factors that could affect quarterly operating results include  but are not limited to demand for our products  the timing and execution of customer contracts  the timing of sales of our products  payments related to asbestos litigation or annual costs related to asbestos litigation that are not covered by insurance or that exceed the annual limits in place with our insurance  the timing of receipt of insurance proceeds  changes in the fair value of call options on goodrich common stock purchased by coltec to reduce the economic risk of the conversion feature of the tides  increases in manufacturing costs due to equipment or labor issues  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  unanticipated delays or problems in introducing new products  announcements by competitors of new products  services or technological innovations  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  increased expenses  whether related to sales and marketing  raw materials or supplies  product development or administration  major changes in the level of economic activity in the us  canada  europe and other major regions in which we do business  costs related to possible future acquisitions of technologies or businesses  an increase in the number or magnitude of product liability claims  our ability to expand our operations and the amount and timing of expenditures related to expansion of our operations  particularly outside the united states  and economic assumptions and market factors used to determine post retirement benefits and pension liabilities 
various provisions and laws could delay or prevent a change of control that you may favor 
the anti takeover provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws  our shareholder rights plan and provisions of north carolina law could delay or prevent a change of control that you may favor or may impede the ability of the holders of our common stock to change our management 
in particular  our articles of incorporation and bylaws  among other things  will require a supermajority shareholder vote to approve any business combination transaction with an owner of or more of our shares unless the transaction is recommended by disinterested directors  divide our board of directors into three classes  with members of each class to be elected for staggered three year terms  if our board is expanded to nine members  limit the right of shareholders to remove directors and fill vacancies  regulate how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholders meetings  and authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series  without shareholder approval 
our shareholder rights plan will also make an acquisition of a controlling interest in enpro in a transaction not approved by our board of directors more difficult 
risks related to our capital structure our debt agreements impose limitations on our operations  which could impede our ability to respond to market conditions  address unanticipated capital investments and or pursue business opportunities 
the agreements relating to the tides and the coltec senior notes impose limitations on our operations 
we also have a senior secured revolving credit facility that imposes additional and  in some cases  more restrictive limitations 
these limitations could impede our ability to respond to market conditions  address unanticipated capital investment needs and or pursue business opportunities 
we may not have adequate cash or the ability to finance conversions of the tides 
until april   each tides is convertible at the option of the holder into a combination of of a share of goodrich common stock and of a share of enpro common stock 
should the holders of the tides exercise their right to convert the tides  coltec would be required to deliver shares of goodrich and enpro common stock to the holders as promptly as practicable on or after the conversion date and in connection therewith would be required to purchase shares of goodrich common stock on the open market  directly from goodrich or by exercising its call options on goodrich common stock discussed below 
coltec may not have sufficient cash on hand or the ability to finance these transactions in the time period required by the agreements relating to the tides 
failure to honor conversion rights would be a default under the tides agreements 
further  the value of goodrich and enpro common stock may increase to a level where coltec s cost to acquire shares in a conversion could exceed  with no maximum  the aggregate liquidation value of the tides of million 
coltec has purchased call options on shares of goodrich common stock with an exercise price of per share the conversion price  in an amount that would be required if all tides holders convert 
until they expire in march  the call options provide protection against the risk that the cash required to finance conversions of the tides could exceed their liquidation value 
while coltec has hedged its exposure to conversion costs in excess of the aggregate liquidation value of the tides  as described earlier  we cannot be certain that coltec will have the financial resources to redeem these securities or effectively hedge its exposure to potential conversion costs in excess of the aggregate liquidation value of the tides beyond the term of the call options 
enpro  goodrich  coltec and coltec capital trust have entered into an indemnification agreement with respect to the tides under which enpro  coltec and coltec capital trust will indemnify goodrich from any costs and liabilities that goodrich incurs as a result of its earlier guarantee of coltec and coltec capital trust s obligations under the tides 
such indemnification obligations may result in payments that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
risks related to our spin off from goodrich corporation coltec s historical consolidated financial information may not be representative of our historical results as an independent company  therefore  it may not be reliable as an indicator of historical or future results 
the historical consolidated financial information of our wholly owned subsidiary coltec included in this report may not reflect what our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows would have been on a historical basis had we operated the enpro business as an independent company during the periods presented or what our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will be in the future 
this is because coltec s historical consolidated financial statements include allocations for services provided or procured by goodrich 
in addition  we have not made adjustments to coltec s historical consolidated financial information to reflect other changes that occurred in our cost structure  financing and operations as a result of the distribution 
finally  as a result of the distribution  goodrich  not enpro  owns coltec s aerospace business which is reflected in coltec s historical consolidated financial information as a discontinued operation 
therefore  coltec s historical consolidated financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance as an independent company
