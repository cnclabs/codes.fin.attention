executive summary recent events true up proceeding pursuant to the texas electric choice plan the texas electric restructuring law  centerpoint houston is permitted to recover certain costs associated with the transition to a competitive retail electric market in texas 
the amount of costs recoverable was determined in a true up proceeding before the texas utility commission 
in march  centerpoint houston filed the final true up application required by the texas electric restructuring law with the texas utility commission 
centerpoint houston s requested true up balance was billion  excluding interest and net of the retail clawback from rri 
in june  july and september  the texas utility commission conducted hearings on and held public meetings addressing centerpoint houston s true up application 
in december  the texas utility commission approved a final order in centerpoint houston s true up proceeding authorizing centerpoint houston to recover billion including interest through august   subject to adjustments to reflect the benefit of certain deferred taxes and the accrual of interest and payment of excess mitigation credits after august  based on our analysis of the texas utility commission s final order  we recorded an after tax charge to earnings in of million to write down our electric generation related regulatory assets to their realizable value  which is reflected as an extraordinary loss in the statements of consolidated operations 
additionally  we have recorded other income of million in the fourth quarter of representing the return on our true up balance for the years  and based on the texas utility commission s final decision on this matter 
in january  we appealed certain aspects of the final order seeking to increase the true up balance ultimately recovered by centerpoint houston 
other parties have also appealed the order  seeking to reduce the amount authorized for centerpoint houston s recovery 
although we believe we have meritorious arguments and that the other parties appeals are without merit  no prediction can be made as to the ultimate outcome or timing of such appeals 
in december  centerpoint houston filed for approval of a financing order to issue transition bonds to securitize its true up balance  which will be adjusted downward to reflect the benefit of certain deferred taxes previously recovered through rates  and upward to reflect the accrual of interest and payment of excess mitigation credits occurring after august  on march   the texas utility commission issued its order allowing centerpoint houston to securitize approximately billion and requiring that the benefit of certain deferred taxes be reflected as a reduction in the competition transition charge

sale of texas genco disposition 
on december   texas genco merged with an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of centerpoint energy 
as a result of the merger  texas genco became our indirect wholly owned subsidiary  and all of texas genco s publicly held shares other than shares held by shareholders who validly perfected their dissenter s rights under texas law were converted into the right to receive per share in cash without interest the merger consideration less any applicable withholding taxes 
in connection with the merger  texas genco entered into a credit agreement the overnight bridge loan under which it borrowed approximately million on december  to finance the payment of the aggregate merger consideration payable as a result of the merger 
texas genco s shares ceased to be publicly traded as of the close of trading on december  the merger was part of the first step of the sale transaction announced in july in which texas genco llc agreed to acquire texas genco for approximately billion in cash 
on december   texas genco completed the sale of its fossil generation assets coal  lignite and gas fired plants to texas genco llc for billion in cash 
texas genco used approximately million of the cash proceeds from the sale to repay the overnight bridge loan and distributed billion  consisting of the balance of the cash proceeds from the sale and cash on hand  to us 
we used the proceeds primarily to repay outstanding indebtedness 
in connection with the sale of texas genco s fossil generation assets to texas genco llc  texas genco  lp  a subsidiary of texas genco genco lp  also entered into a services agreement with texas genco llc  under which texas genco llc has agreed to provide at cost energy dispatch and coordination services to genco lp  administer genco lp s puc mandated capacity auctions and market genco lp s excess capacity and energy to third parties 
for those services  genco lp will pay a monthly fee 
following the sale of its fossil generation assets  texas genco s principal remaining asset is its interest in the south texas project electric generating station  a nuclear generating facility south texas project 
texas genco currently owns a interest in the south texas project  that is subject to increase pursuant to the right of first refusal described below  and currently bears a corresponding share of the capital and operating costs associated with the project 
in connection with the sale of texas genco s fossil generation assets to texas genco llc  genco lp entered into a power purchase and sale agreement with a subsidiary of texas genco llc  which we refer to as the back to back power purchase agreement 
under this agreement  genco lp has agreed to sell forward a substantial portion of genco lp s total share of the energy from the south texas project through december  genco lp has agreed to sell this energy on a unit contingent basis  meaning that genco lp will be excused subject to the contingent payment for economic costs described below from its obligations to deliver this energy to the extent the energy is unavailable as a result of a derating or forced outage at the south texas project or other specified causes 
during the period from the closing of the first step of the sale transaction until the closing of the second step  the pricing for the energy sold under the back to back power purchase agreement will be at the weighted average price achieved by texas genco llc on its firm forward sales in the south ercot zone  subject to payment by genco lp to texas genco llc  in the event the second step does not close  of of the economic cost ie  liquidated damages payable to third parties or cost of cover incurred by texas genco llc during that period as a result of energy from the south texas project being unavailable to meet the contract quantity 
after any termination of the transaction agreement  the pricing for this energy will be at of such weighted average price  with no contingent payment for economic costs 
the transaction agreement may be terminated under various circumstances  including a failure to close the second step of the sale transaction by april  which date may be extended by either party for up to two consecutive day periods if nrc approval has not yet been obtained or is being contested and all other closing conditions are capable of being satisfied 
the second step of the transaction  the merger of texas genco with a subsidiary of texas genco llc in exchange for an additional cash payment to us of million  is expected to close during the first half of following receipt of approval from the nrc 
total cash proceeds to centerpoint energy from both steps of the transaction are expected to be billion 
we recorded an after tax loss of approximately million in related to the sale of texas genco and an additional after tax loss of million offsetting our interest in texas genco s earnings from july  until the sale of texas genco is complete  our interest in any future texas genco earnings will be offset by an increase in the loss on the pending sale 
the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k present texas genco s operations as discontinued operations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas no 

right of first refusal 
in september  genco lp signed an agreement to purchase a portion of aep texas central company s aep interest in the south texas project for approximately million 
once the purchase is complete  genco lp will own an additional interest in the south texas project for a total of  or approximately  mw 
this purchase agreement was entered into pursuant to genco lp s right of first refusal to purchase this interest when aep announced its agreement to sell this interest to a third party 
in addition to aep s ownership interest and genco lp s current ownership  the  mw nuclear plant is currently owned by city public service of san antonio cps and owned by austin energy 
cps is expected to purchase aep s remaining ownership interest under its right of first refusal 
the sale is subject to approval by the nrc 
texas genco expects to fund the purchase of its share of aep s interest  including reimbursements of draws under letters of credit  with existing cash balances that have been provided to cash collateralize the letters of credit as described below and  if necessary  cash expected to be generated through operations 
if cps were to default and fail to purchase the interest it has agreed to acquire  texas genco would purchase aep s entire interest in the south texas project  in which case texas genco would need approximately million of additional cash 
we expect this transaction will be completed by the end of the second quarter of in december  prior to the consummation of the sale of texas genco s coal  lignite and gas fired generation assets to texas genco llc  the million revolving credit facility of genco lp was terminated and the then outstanding letters of credit aggregating million issued under the facility in favor of aep relating to the right of first refusal were cash collateralized at of their face amount 
in february  genco lp also established a million term loan facility under which borrowings may be made for working capital purposes at libor plus basis points 
two drawings aggregating million may be made under the facility which matures on the earlier of august or the closing of the final step of the texas genco sale 
an initial draw of million was made in february this facility is secured by a lien on texas genco s equity and partnership interests in its subsidiaries and cash collateral accounts described above 
significant events in resolution of legal proceedings relating to the true up proceeding  recovery of amounts approved in the true up proceeding and the sale of our remaining interest in texas genco are the most significant events facing us in we expect to use the proceeds received from these events to further repay a portion of our indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes 
in january  we appealed certain aspects of the final order seeking to increase the true up balance ultimately recovered by centerpoint houston 
other parties have also appealed the order  seeking to reduce the amount authorized for centerpoint houston s recovery 
although we believe we have meritorious arguments and that the other parties appeals are without merit  no prediction can be made as to the ultimate outcome or timing of such appeals 
we recorded an after tax loss of approximately million in related to the sale of our interest in texas genco 
see recent events above 
we also recorded an after tax extraordinary loss of million in related to the true up proceeding as discussed above 
portions of these losses recorded in periods prior to the fourth quarter of reduced our earnings below the level required for us to continue paying our current quarterly dividends out of current earnings as required under our securities and exchange commission sec financing order 
however  in may  we received an order from the sec under the act authorizing us to continue to pay our current quarterly dividend in the second and third quarters of out of capital or unearned surplus in the event we had such losses 
we declared a dividend in the fourth quarter of out of current earnings 
if our earnings for subsequent quarters are insufficient to pay dividends from current earnings  additional authority would be required from the sec for payment of the quarterly dividend from capital or unearned surplus  but there can be no assurance that the sec would authorize such payments 
these losses would delay the timing of our achievement of a ratio of common equity to total capitalization of as generally required by the sec under the act 
accordingly  we may issue equity and take other actions to achieve a future equity capitalization of 
in march  we replaced our million revolving credit facility with a billion five year revolving credit facility 
borrowings may be made under the facility at libor plus basis points based on current credit ratings 
an additional utilization fee of basis points applies to borrowings any time more than of the facility is utilized 
changes in credit ratings would lower or raise the increment to libor depending on whether ratings improved or were lowered 
in march  centerpoint houston established a million five year revolving credit facility 
borrowings may be made under the facility at libor plus basis points based on centerpoint houston s current credit rating 
an additional utilization fee of basis points applies to borrowings any time more than of the facility is utilized 
changes in credit ratings would lower or raise the increment to libor depending on whether ratings improved or were lowered 
centerpoint houston also established a billion credit facility in march this facility is available to be utilized only to refinance centerpoint houston s billion term loan maturing in november in the event that proceeds from the issuance of transition bonds are not sufficient to repay such term loan 
drawings may be made under this credit facility until november  at which time any outstanding borrowings are converted to term loans maturing in november net proceeds from the issuance of transition bonds and certain new net indebtedness for borrowed money issued by centerpoint houston in excess of million must be used to repay borrowings under the new facility 
based on centerpoint houston s current credit ratings  borrowings under the facility can be made at libor plus basis points 
changes in credit ratings would lower or raise the increment to libor depending on whether ratings improved or were lowered 
any drawings under this facility must be secured by centerpoint houston s general mortgage bonds in the same principal amount and bearing the same interest rate as such drawings 
in march  we filed a registration statement relating to an offer to exchange our convertible senior notes due for a new series of convertible senior notes due this registration statement has not yet been declared effective by the sec 
we expect to conduct the exchange offer in response to the guidance set forth in emerging issues task force issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share 
under that guidance  because the terms of the new notes provide for settlement of the principal amount on conversion in cash rather than our common stock  exchanging new notes for old notes will allow us to exclude the portion of the conversion value of the new notes attributable to their principal amount from our computation of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 
highlights in addition to the extraordinary loss related to the true up proceeding and the loss related to the sale of texas genco as discussed above  our operating performance for compared to were affected by the termination of revenues related to excess cost over market ecom as of january  compared to ecom revenues of million recorded in an increase in operating income of million in our electric transmission distribution business segment  excluding ecom  primarily due to the absence of an million reserve recorded in related to the final fuel reconciliation  excluding interest  and a million reversal of this reserve in  an increase in other income of million related to the return on our true up balance as discussed above  rate increases of million in in our natural gas distribution business segment  increased operating income of million in our pipelines and gathering business segment primarily from increased throughput  favorable commodity prices and increased ancillary services  and continued customer growth  with the addition of over  metered electric and gas customers 
certain factors affecting future earnings our past earnings and results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our future earnings and results of operations 
the magnitude of our future earnings and results of our operations will depend on or be affected by numerous factors including the timing and amount of our recovery of the true up components  the timing and results of the monetization of our remaining interest in texas genco  state and federal legislative and regulatory actions or developments  including deregulation  re regulation  constraints placed on our activities or business by the act  changes in or application of laws or regulations applicable to other aspects of our business and actions with respect to allowed rates of return  rate structures  recovery of investments  and operation and construction of facilities  industrial  commercial and residential growth in our service territory and changes in market demand and demographic patterns  the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices  particularly natural gas  changes in interest rates or rates of inflation  weather variations and other natural phenomena  the timing and extent of changes in the supply of natural gas  commercial bank and financial market conditions  our access to capital  the cost of such capital  receipt of certain financing approvals under the act  and the results of our financing and refinancing efforts  including availability of funds in the debt capital markets  actions by rating agencies  inability of various counterparties to meet their obligations to us  non payment for our services due to financial distress of our customers  including rri  the outcome of the pending securities lawsuits against us  reliant energy and rri  the ability of rri to satisfy its obligations to us  including indemnity obligations  our ability to control costs  the investment performance of our employee benefit plans  our internal restructuring or other restructuring options that may be pursued  our potential business strategies  including acquisitions or dispositions of assets or businesses  which cannot be assured to be completed or beneficial to us  and other factors discussed in item of this report under risk factors

s receivables facility million 
additionally  other changes in working capital items  primarily increased net accounts receivable and accounts payable due to higher natural gas prices in december as compared to december million  contributed to the overall decrease in cash provided by operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities will be negatively impacted in by the payment of taxes associated with the sale of texas genco  the proceeds of which are reflected in cash provided by investing activities in as discussed below 
net cash provided by operating activities in increased million compared to primarily due to higher income tax refunds received of million  partially offset by higher interest paid related to outstanding borrowings of million 
cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by investing activities increased billion in as compared to primarily due to proceeds of billion received from the sale of texas genco s fossil generation assets in december  partially offset by increased capital expenditures of million primarily related to our electric transmission distribution and other operations business segments 
net cash used in investing activities decreased million during compared to due primarily to decreased capital expenditures in our electric transmission distribution business segment primarily resulting from process improvements that included revised construction and design standards 
cash provided by used in financing activities in  debt payments exceeded net loan proceeds by billion 
proceeds received from the sale of texas genco s fossil generation assets in december and the retail clawback payment from rri as discussed above were used to retire a million term loan  pay down million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility and retire million of trust preferred securities 
as of december   we had borrowings of million under our revolving credit facility which were used to fund a portion of the million pension contribution made in december in  debt payments exceeded net loan proceeds by million 
in  net loan proceeds exceeded debt payments by billion 
additionally  common stock dividends paid by us in were million less than in since the beginning of  the terms of our credit facility limited the common stock dividend to per share per quarter 
this dividend limitation was eliminated in the new billion credit facility entered into in march future sources and uses of cash our liquidity and capital requirements are affected primarily by our results of operations  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  tax payments  working capital needs  various regulatory actions and appeals relating to such regulatory actions 
our principal cash requirements during  excluding the requirements of texas genco  include the following approximately million of capital expenditures  an estimated million in refunds by centerpoint houston of excess mitigation credits assuming they are terminated as of april   dividend payments on centerpoint energy common stock and debt service payments  billion of maturing long term debt  including million of transition bonds  and income tax payments  including approximately million in the first quarter of significant cash inflows in are expected to include the following cash proceeds of approximately from the issuance of transition bonds  and cash proceeds of million from the sale of texas genco 
we expect that borrowings under our credit facilities and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for centerpoint houston s billion term loan requires the proceeds from the issuance of transition bonds to be used to reduce the term loan unless refused by the lenders 
centerpoint houston s billion credit facility is expected to be utilized if the billion term loan matures prior to the issuance of sufficient transition bonds 
the credit facility requires that proceeds from the issuance of transition bonds and certain new net indebtedness for borrowed money issued by centerpoint houston in excess of million be used to repay borrowings under the credit facility 
the act regulates our financing ability  as more fully described in certain contractual and regulatory limits on ability to issue securities and pay dividends on our common stock below

in october  centerpoint houston was required by the texas utility commission to reverse the amount of redirected depreciation and accelerated depreciation taken for regulatory purposes as allowed under the transition plan and the texas electric restructuring law 
centerpoint houston recorded a regulatory liability to reflect the prospective refund of the accelerated depreciation and in january centerpoint houston began paying excess mitigation credits  which were to be paid over a seven year period 
the annual payment of excess mitigation credits is approximately million 
in january  centerpoint houston filed a writ of mandamus petition with the texas supreme court asking that court to order the texas utility commission to terminate immediately the payment of all excess mitigation credits and to ensure full recovery of all excess mitigation credits 
although we believe we have meritorious arguments  a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy and no prediction can be made as to the ultimate outcome or timing of the mandamus petition 
if the supreme court denies our mandamus petition  we will continue to pursue this issue through regular appellate mechanisms 
on march   a non unanimous settlement was filed in docket no 
 which involves the adjustment of rri s price to beat 
under the terms of that settlement  the excess mitigation credits being paid by centerpoint houston would be terminated as of april  the texas utility commission approved the settlement on march  off balance sheet arrangements 
other than operating leases  we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
however  we do participate in a receivables factoring arrangement 
cerc corp 
has a bankruptcy remote subsidiary  which we consolidate  which was formed for the sole purpose of buying receivables created by cerc and selling those receivables to an unrelated third party 
this transaction is accounted for as a sale of receivables under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  and  as a result  the related receivables are excluded from the consolidated balance sheet 
in january  the million receivables facility was replaced with a million receivables facility terminating in january in january  the facility was extended to january and temporarily increased  for the period from january to june  to million 
for additional information regarding this transaction please read note i to our consolidated financial statements 
credit facilities 
in march  we replaced our million revolving credit facility with a billion five year revolving credit facility 
borrowings may be made under the facility at libor plus basis points based on current credit ratings 
an additional utilization fee of basis points applies to borrowings any time more than of the facility is utilized 
changes in credit ratings would lower or raise the increment to libor depending on whether ratings improved or were lowered 
the facility contains covenants  including a debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda covenant and an ebitda to interest covenant 
borrowings under our credit facility are available upon customary terms and conditions for facilities of this type  including a requirement that we represent  except as described below  that no material adverse change has occurred at the time of a new borrowing under this facility 
a material adverse change is defined as the occurrence of a material adverse change in our ability to perform our obligations under the facility 
the base line for any determination of a relative material adverse change is our most recently audited financial statements 
at any time after the first time our credit ratings reach at least bbb by standard poor s ratings services  a division of the mcgraw hill companies s p  and baa by moody s investors service  inc moody s  bbb by s p and baa by moody s  or bbb by s p and baa by moody s  or if the drawing is to retire maturing commercial paper  we are not required to represent as a condition to such drawing that no material adverse change has occurred or that no litigation expected to have a material adverse effect has occurred 
also in march  centerpoint houston established a million five year revolving credit facility 
borrowings may be made under the facility at libor plus basis points based on centerpoint houston s current credit rating 
an additional utilization fee of basis points applies to borrowings any time more than of the facility is utilized 
changes in credit ratings would lower or raise the increment to libor depending on whether ratings improved or were lowered 
centerpoint houston also established a billion credit facility in march this facility is available to be utilized only to refinance centerpoint houston s billion term loan maturing in november in the event that proceeds from the issuance of transition bonds are not sufficient to repay such term loan 
drawings may be made under this credit facility until november  at which time any outstanding borrowings are converted to term loans maturing in november net proceeds from the issuance of transition bonds and certain new net indebtedness for borrowed money issued by centerpoint houston in excess of million must be used to repay borrowings under the new facility 
based on centerpoint houston s current credit ratings  borrowings under the facility can be made at libor plus basis points 
changes in credit ratings would lower or raise the increment to libor depending on whether ratings improved or were lowered 
any drawings under this facility must be secured by centerpoint houston s general mortgage bonds in the same principal amount and bearing the same interest rate as such drawings 
centerpoint houston s million and billion credit facilities each contain covenants  including a debt to total capitalization covenant of and an ebitda to interest covenant 
borrowings under centerpoint houston s million credit facility and its billion credit facility are available notwithstanding that a material adverse change has occurred or litigation that could be expected to have a material adverse effect has occurred  so long as other customary terms and conditions are satisfied 
in february  genco lp also established a million term loan facility under which borrowings may be made for working capital purposes at libor plus basis points 
two drawings aggregating million may be made under the facility which matures on the earlier of august or the closing of the final step of the texas genco sale 
an initial draw of million was made in february this facility is secured by a lien on texas genco s equity and the partnership interests in its subsidiaries and cash collateral accounts set up in connection with the sale of texas genco s coal  lignite and gas fired generation assets 
as of march   we had the following credit facilities in millions amount utilized at date executed company size of facility march  termination date march  cerc corp 
march  march  centerpoint energy  march  march  centerpoint houston march  march  centerpoint houston  february  texas genco revolver until november with two year term out of borrowed moneys 
earlier of august or the closing of the final step of the texas genco sale 
securities registered with the sec 
at december   centerpoint energy had a shelf registration statement covering senior debt securities  preferred stock and common stock aggregating billion and cerc corp 
had a shelf registration statement covering million principal amount of debt securities 
temporary investments 
on december   we had temporary external investments of million  of which million were investments of texas genco and are included in current assets of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets 
money pools 
we have two money pools through which our participating subsidiaries can borrow or invest on a short term basis 
funding needs are aggregated and external borrowing or investing is based on the net cash position 
following texas genco s certification by the ferc as an exempt wholesale generator under the act in october  it could no longer participate with our regulated subsidiaries in the same money pool 
in october  we established our second money pool in which texas genco and its subsidiaries are currently the sole participants 
the net funding requirements of the money pool in which our regulated subsidiaries participate are expected to be met with borrowings under centerpoint energy s revolving credit facility 
except in an emergency situation in which case we could provide funding pursuant to applicable sec rules  we would be required to obtain approval from the sec to issue and sell securities for purposes of funding texas genco s operations via the money pool established in october we do not currently expect to fund the operations of texas genco via the money pool 
a million credit facility  established in february at a subsidiary of texas genco  is expected to be used to fund texas genco s operations 
the terms of both money pools are in accordance with requirements applicable to registered public utility holding companies under the act and under an order from the sec relating to our financing activities and those of our subsidiaries on june  june financing order 
this order expires in june  however  we will seek appropriate approval for the money pool prior to that date 
impact on liquidity of a downgrade in credit ratings 
as of march   moody s  s p  and fitch  inc fitch had assigned the following credit ratings to senior debt of centerpoint energy and certain subsidiaries moody s s p fitch company instrument rating outlook rating outlook rating outlook centerpoint energy senior unsecured debt ba negative bbb negative bbb stable centerpoint houston senior secured debt first mortgage bonds baa negative bbb negative bbb stable cerc corp 
senior debt ba stable bbb negative bbb stable a negative outlook from moody s reflects concerns over the next to months which will either lead to a review for a potential downgrade or a return to a stable outlook 
a stable outlook from moody s indicates that moody s does not expect to put the rating on review for an upgrade or downgrade within months from when the outlook was assigned or last affirmed 
an s p rating outlook assesses the potential direction of a long term credit rating over the intermediate to longer term 
a stable outlook from fitch encompasses a one to two year horizon as to the likely ratings direction 
we cannot assure you that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency 
we note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency 
each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short and long term financing  the cost of such financings and the execution of our commercial strategies 
a decline in credit ratings would increase borrowing costs under our billion credit facility  centerpoint houston s million credit facility and its billion credit facility and cerc s million revolving credit facility 
a decline in credit ratings would also increase the interest rate on long term debt to be issued in the capital markets and would negatively impact our ability to complete capital market transactions 
if we were unable to maintain an investment grade rating from at least one rating agency  as a registered public utility holding company we would be required to obtain further approval from the sec for any additional capital markets transactions as more fully described in certain contractual and regulatory limits on ability to issue securities and pay dividends on our common stock below 
additionally  a decline in credit ratings could increase cash collateral requirements and reduce margins of our natural gas distribution business segment 
as described above under credit facilities  our revolving credit facility contains a material adverse change clause that could impact our ability to make new borrowings under this facility 
cerc corp 
s credit facility also contains a material adverse change clause which relates to cerc corp 
s ability to perform its obligations under the credit agreement 
texas genco s term loan facility contains a material adverse change clause that could impact the second borrowing under the facility 
the clause relates to the business  condition financial or otherwise  operations  performance or properties of texas genco 
borrowings under centerpoint houston s million credit facility and its billion facility are available notwithstanding that a material adverse change has occurred or litigation that could be expected to have a material adverse effect has occurred 
in september  we issued zero premium exchangeable subordinated notes due zens having an original principal amount of billion 
each zens note is exchangeable at the holder s option at any time for an amount of cash equal to of the market value of the reference shares of time warner inc tw common attributable to each zens note 
if our creditworthiness were to drop such that zens note holders thought our liquidity was adversely affected or the market for the zens notes were to become illiquid  some zens noteholders might decide to exchange their zens notes for cash 
funds for the payment of cash upon exchange could be obtained from the sale of the shares of tw common that we own or from other sources 
we own shares of tw common equal to of the reference shares used to calculate our obligation to the holders of the zens notes 
zens note exchanges result in a cash outflow because deferred tax liabilities related to the zens notes and tw common shares become current tax obligations when zens notes are exchanged and tw common shares are sold 
centerpoint energy gas services  inc cegs  a wholly owned subsidiary of cerc corp  provides comprehensive natural gas sales and services to industrial and commercial customers that are primarily located within or near the territories served by our pipelines and natural gas distribution subsidiaries 
in order to hedge its exposure to natural gas prices  cegs has agreements with provisions standard for the industry that establish credit thresholds and require a party to provide additional collateral on two business days notice when that party s rating or the rating of a credit support provider for that party cerc corp 
in this case falls below those levels 
as of december   the senior unsecured debt of cerc corp 
was rated bbb by s p and ba by moody s 
we estimate that as of december   unsecured credit limits extended to cegs by counterparties could aggregate million  however  utilized credit capacity is significantly lower 
cross defaults 
under our revolving credit facility  a payment default on  or a non payment default that permits acceleration of  any indebtedness exceeding million by us or any of our significant subsidiaries will cause a default 
pursuant to the indenture governing our senior notes  a payment default by us  cerc corp 
or centerpoint houston in respect of  or an acceleration of  borrowed money and certain other specified types of obligations  in the aggregate principal amount of million will cause a default 
as of february   we had issued five series of senior notes aggregating billion in principal amount under this indenture 
a default by centerpoint energy would not trigger a default under our subsidiaries debt instruments or bank credit facilities 
other factors that could affect cash requirements 
in addition to the above factors  our liquidity and capital resources could be affected by cash collateral requirements that could exist in connection with certain contracts  including gas purchases  gas price hedging and gas storage activities of our natural gas distribution business segment  particularly given gas price levels and volatility  acceleration of payment dates on certain gas supply contracts under certain circumstances  as a result of increased gas prices and concentration of suppliers  increased costs related to the acquisition of gas for storage  increases in interest expense in connection with debt refinancings  various regulatory actions  the ability of rri and its subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations as the principal customers of centerpoint houston and in respect of rri s indemnity obligations to us and our subsidiaries  and various of the risks identified in risk factors 
certain contractual and regulatory limits on ability to issue securities and pay dividends on our common stock 
limitations imposed on us as a registered public utility holding company under the act affect our ability to issue securities  pay dividends on our common stock or take other actions that affect our capitalization 
the secured term loan and each of the credit facilities of centerpoint houston limits centerpoint houston s debt  excluding transition bonds  as a percentage of its total capitalization to 
cerc corp 
s bank facility and its receivables facility limit cerc s debt as a percentage of its total capitalization to and contain an ebitda to interest covenant 
our billion credit facility contains a debt to ebitda covenant and an ebitda to interest covenant 
centerpoint houston s billion and million credit facilities also contain ebitda to interest covenants 
we are a registered public utility holding company under the act 
the act and related rules and regulations impose a number of restrictions on our activities and those of our subsidiaries other than texas genco 
the act  among other things  limits our ability and the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to issue debt and equity securities without prior authorization  restricts the source of dividend payments to current and retained earnings without prior authorization  regulates sales and acquisitions of certain assets and businesses and governs affiliated service  sales and construction contracts 
the june financing order is effective until june  additionally  we have received several subsequent orders which provide additional financing authority 
these orders establish limits on the amount of external debt and equity securities that can be issued by us and our regulated subsidiaries without additional authorization but generally permit us to refinance our existing obligations and those of our regulated subsidiaries 
each of us and our subsidiaries is in compliance with the authorized limits 
discussed below are the incremental amounts of debt and equity that we are authorized to issue after giving effect to our capital markets transactions in and the orders also permit utilization of undrawn credit facilities at centerpoint energy and cerc 
as of february  centerpoint energy is authorized to issue an additional aggregate billion of debt securities and million of preferred stock and preferred securities  centerpoint houston is authorized to issue an additional aggregate million of debt and an aggregate million of preferred stock and preferred securities  and cerc is authorized to issue an additional million of debt and an additional aggregate million of preferred stock and preferred securities 
the sec has reserved jurisdiction over  and must take further action to permit  the issuance of million of additional debt at centerpoint energy  million of additional debt at cerc and million of additional debt at centerpoint houston 
the orders require that if we or any of our regulated subsidiaries issue securities that are rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization nrsro  the security to be issued must obtain an investment grade rating from at least one nrsro and  as a condition to such issuance  all outstanding rated securities of the issuer and of centerpoint energy must be rated investment grade by at least one nrsro 
the orders also contain certain requirements for interest rates  maturities  issuance expenses and use of proceeds 
the act limits the payment of dividends to payment from current and retained earnings unless specific authorization is obtained to pay dividends from other sources 
the sec has reserved jurisdiction over payment of million of dividends from centerpoint energy s unearned surplus or capital 
further authorization would be required to make those payments 
as of december   we had a retained deficit on our consolidated balance sheets 
we recorded an after tax loss of approximately million in related to the sale of our remaining interest in texas genco 
in addition  we recorded an after tax extraordinary loss of million in related to the true up proceeding 
portions of these losses recorded in periods prior to the fourth quarter of reduced our earnings below the level required for us to continue paying our current quarterly dividends out of current earnings as required under our sec financing order 
however  in may  we received an order from the sec under the act authorizing us to continue to pay our current quarterly dividend in the second and third quarters of out of capital or unearned surplus in the event we had such losses 
we declared a dividend in the fourth quarter of out of current earnings 
if our earnings for subsequent quarters are insufficient to pay dividends from current earnings  additional authority would be required from the sec for payment of the quarterly dividend from capital or unearned surplus  but there can be no assurance that the sec would authorize such payments 
these losses would delay the timing of our achievement of a ratio of common equity to total capitalization of  as generally required by the sec under the act 
accordingly  we may issue equity and take other actions to achieve a future equity capitalization of 
the june financing order also requires that centerpoint houston and cerc maintain a ratio of common equity to total capitalization of 
other factors affecting the upstreaming of cash from subsidiaries 
centerpoint houston s term loan  subject to certain exceptions  limits the application of proceeds from capital markets transactions over million by centerpoint houston to repayment of debt existing in november centerpoint houston will distribute recovery of the true up components not used to repay centerpoint houston s indebtedness to us through the payment of dividends 
centerpoint houston requires sec action to approve any dividends in excess of its current and retained earnings 
to maintain centerpoint houston s capital structure at the appropriate levels  we may reinvest funds in centerpoint houston in the form of equity contributions or intercompany loans 
under the orders described under certain contractual and regulatory limits on ability to issue securities and pay dividends on our common stock  centerpoint houston s member s equity as a percentage of total capitalization generally must be at least  although the sec has permitted the percentage to be below this level for other companies taking into account non recourse securitization debt as a component of capitalization 
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex accounting estimates 
an accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element  item or account in the financial statements 
accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events  or the present status of an asset or liability 
the accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made 
additionally  different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 
the circumstances that make these judgments difficult  subjective and or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates 
accordingly  these accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
accounting for rate regulation sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas no 
 provides that rate regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected 
application of sfas no 
to the electric generation portion of our business was discontinued as of june  our electric transmission distribution business continues to apply sfas no 
which results in our accounting for the regulatory effects of recovery of stranded costs and other regulatory assets resulting from the unbundling of the transmission and distribution business from our electric generation operations in our consolidated financial statements 
certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers 
significant accounting estimates embedded within the application of sfas no 
with respect to our electric transmission distribution business segment relate to billion of recoverable electric generation related regulatory assets as of december  these costs are recoverable under the provisions of the texas electric restructuring law 
based on our analysis of the texas utility commission s final order in the true up proceeding  we recorded an after tax charge to earnings in of approximately million to write down our electric generation related regulatory assets to their realizable value  which is reflected as an extraordinary loss in the statements of consolidated operations 
impairment of long lived assets and intangibles we review the carrying value of our long lived assets  including goodwill and identifiable intangibles  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable  and annually for goodwill as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
no impairment of goodwill was indicated based on our analysis as of january  unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in the value of long lived assets and intangibles due to changes in estimates of future cash flows  regulatory matters and operating costs could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge 
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures 
the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques 
we recorded an after tax loss of approximately million in related to the sale of our remaining interest in texas genco 
unbilled energy revenues revenues related to the sale and or delivery of electricity or natural gas energy are generally recorded when energy is delivered to customers 
however  the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters  which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month 
at the end of each month  amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated 
unbilled electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on daily supply volumes  applicable rates and analyses reflecting significant historical trends and experience 
unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes  estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect 
as additional information becomes available  or actual amounts are determinable  the recorded estimates are revised 
consequently  operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates 
pension and other retirement plans we sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements 
we use several statistical and other factors which attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as estimated by management  within certain guidelines 
in addition  our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these factors 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded 
please read other significant matters pension plans for further discussion 
new accounting pronouncements see note n to the consolidated financial statements  incorporated herein by reference  for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us 
other significant matters pension plan 
as discussed in note b to our consolidated financial statements  we maintain a non contributory pension plan covering substantially all employees 
employer contributions are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under the employee retirement income security act of erisa and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes 
at december   the projected benefit obligation exceeded the market value of plan assets by million  however  the market value of the plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation by million 
changes in interest rates and the market values of the securities held by the plan during could materially  positively or negatively  change our funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in and beyond 
in connection with the sale of our interest in texas genco  a separate pension plan was established for texas genco on september  and we transferred a net pension liability of approximately million to texas genco 
in october  texas genco received an allocation of assets from our pension plan pursuant to rules and regulations under erisa 
during and  we have not been required to make contributions to our pension plan 
we have made voluntary contributions of million and million in and  respectively 
under the terms of our pension plan  we reserve the right to change  modify or terminate the plan 
our funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under erisa and the internal revenue code 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  changes in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension costs in the income statement  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants 
as such  significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants 
pension costs were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
for  a pension benefit of million was recorded related to rri s participants 
pension benefit for rri s participants is reflected in the statement of consolidated operations as discontinued operations 
in addition  included in the costs for  and are million  million and million  respectively  of expense related to texas genco participants 
pension expense for texas genco participants is reflected in the statement of consolidated operations as discontinued operations 
additionally  we maintain a non qualified benefit restoration plan which allows participants to retain the benefits to which they would have been entitled under our non contributory pension plan except for the federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated 
the expense associated with this non qualified plan was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
included in the cost for is million of expense related to rri s participants  which is reflected in discontinued operations in the statements of consolidated operations 
the calculation of pension expense and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions 
two of the most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
as of december   the expected long term rate of return on plan assets was  a reduction from the rate assumed as of december  we believe that our actual asset allocation  on average  will approximate the targeted allocation and the estimated return on net assets 
we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance plan assets as appropriate 
as of december   the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of  which is a decline from the discount rate assumed in the discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on high quality bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations specific to the characteristics of our plan 
pension expense for  including the benefit restoration plan  is estimated to be million based on an expected return on plan assets of and a discount rate of as of december  if the expected return assumption were lowered by from to  pension expense would increase by approximately million 
due to significant funding that occurred during  pension plan assets excluding the unfunded benefit restoration plan exceed the accumulated benefit obligation  which enabled us to reverse a charge to comprehensive income of million  net of tax 
however  if the discount rate were lowered by from to  the assumption change would increase our projected benefit obligation  accumulated benefit obligation and pension expense by approximately million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  the assumption change would have significant impacts on our consolidated balance sheet by changing the pension asset recorded as of december  of million to a pension liability of million  offset by a charge to comprehensive income in of million  net of tax 
for the benefit restoration plan  if the discount rate were lowered by from to  the assumption change would increase our projected benefit obligation  accumulated benefit obligation and pension expense by approximately million  million  and less than million  respectively 
in addition  the assumption change would result in a charge to comprehensive income of approximately million 
future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plan will impact our future pension expense and liabilities 
we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be 
in october  the american jobs creation act ajca was signed into law 
the ajca made significant changes in the taxation of nonqualified deferred compensation with new code section a 
non compliance with section a can result in increased federal income taxes on nonqualified deferred compensation for employees 
we are currently analyzing the impact of section a and related guidance issued by the treasury department and the internal revenue service  on our non qualified plans and agreements that provide for deferred compensation 
such plans or agreements may require amendment or modification to comply with the new law 
quasi reorganization 
on december   our board of directors adopted a plan for an accounting reorganization of the company  to be effective as of january  at the same time  the manager of centerpoint houston adopted a similar plan for centerpoint houston 
these plans were adopted in order to eliminate the accumulated retained earnings deficit that exists at both companies 
the plan we adopted required a report to be presented to and reviewed by our board of directors on or before february  as to the completion of the valuation analysis of the accounting reorganization and the effects of the accounting reorganization on our financial statements  a determination that the accounting reorganization is in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and that there be no determination by our board of directors on or before february  that the accounting reorganization is inconsistent with our regulatory obligations 
we are continuing to work to complete the valuation analysis and the effects on our financial statements of the accounting reorganization  and on february   our board of directors extended until may  the time for making the determination described in of the preceding sentence 
an accounting reorganization  sometimes called a quasi reorganization  allows a company to extinguish a negative retained earnings balance 
it involves restating a company s assets and its liabilities to their fair values 
the negative balance in the retained earnings account is then brought to zero through a reduction in the other capital accounts  giving the company a fresh start with a zero balance in retained earnings 
as of december   we had an accumulated retained earnings deficit of approximately billion 
that deficit stemmed from the accounting effects of the distribution of our ownership interest in rri to our shareholders in september  the extraordinary loss recorded in connection with the texas utility commission s order related to the true up proceeding and the loss on discontinued operations that was recorded in connection with our sale of texas genco 
in addition to eliminating the accumulated deficit in retained earnings and restating assets and liabilities to fair value  if a quasi reorganization were implemented  we and centerpoint houston would be required to implement any accounting standards that have been issued but not yet adopted 
we and centerpoint houston are seeking to eliminate the negative retained earnings balance because restrictions contained in the act require registered public utility holding companies and their subsidiaries  like us and centerpoint houston  to obtain express authorization from the sec to pay dividends when current or retained earnings are insufficient to do so 
eliminating the negative retained earnings balance will permit current earnings not utilized to pay dividends to more quickly build up a retained earnings balance 
under act regulations  we could pay dividends out of this balance during periods when current earnings may not be adequate to do so 
in addition  we have undertaken an obligation under the act to achieve a minimum ratio of common equity to total capitalization of thirty percent  which  depending on the results of the restatement of assets and liabilities under the accounting reorganization  could be affected by  and will be taken into consideration by the board of directors in evaluating the effects of  the accounting reorganization 
we will seek such authority as may be required under the act in connection with the quasi reorganization 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk impact of changes in interest rates and energy commodity prices we are exposed to various market risks 
these risks arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business and are inherent in our consolidated financial statements 
most of the revenues and income from our business activities are impacted by market risks 
categories of market risk include exposure to commodity prices through non trading activities  interest rates and equity prices 
a description of each market risk is set forth below commodity price risk results from exposures to changes in spot prices  forward prices and price volatilities of commodities  such as natural gas and other energy commodities risk 
interest rate risk primarily results from exposures to changes in the level of borrowings and changes in interest rates 
equity price risk results from exposures to changes in prices of individual equity securities 
management has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks 
we manage these risk exposures through the implementation of our risk management policies and framework 
we manage our exposures through the use of derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instrument contracts 
during the normal course of business  we review our hedging strategies and determine the hedging approach we deem appropriate based upon the circumstances of each situation 
derivative instruments such as futures  forward contracts  swaps and options derive their value from underlying assets  indices  reference rates or a combination of these factors 
these derivative instruments include negotiated contracts  which are referred to as over the counter derivatives  and instruments that are listed and traded on an exchange 
derivative transactions are entered into in our non trading operations to manage and hedge certain exposures  such as exposure to changes in gas prices 
we believe that the associated market risk of these instruments can best be understood relative to the underlying assets or risk being hedged 
interest rate risk we have outstanding long term debt  bank loans  mandatory redeemable preferred securities of a subsidiary trust holding solely our junior subordinated debentures trust preferred securities  some lease obligations and our obligations under our zero premium exchangeable subordinated notes due zens that subject us to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
in  we had interest rate swaps in place in order to hedge portions of our floating rate debt 
our floating rate obligations aggregated billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
if the floating interest rates were to increase by from december  rates  our combined interest expense would increase by a total of million each month in which such increase continued 
at december  and  we had outstanding fixed rate debt excluding indexed debt securities and trust preferred securities aggregating billion and billion  respectively  in principal amount and having a fair value of billion and billion  respectively 
these instruments are fixed rate and  therefore  do not expose us to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates please read note to our consolidated financial statements 
however  the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately million if interest rates were to decline by from their levels at december  in general  such an increase in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if we were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments in the open market prior to their maturity 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  upon adoption of sfas no 
effective january   the zens obligation was bifurcated into a debt component and a derivative component 
the debt component of million at december  is a fixed rate obligation and  therefore  does not expose us to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates 
however  the fair value of the debt component would increase by approximately million if interest rates were to decline by from levels at december  changes in the fair value of the derivative component  million at december   are recorded in our statements of consolidated operations and  therefore  we are exposed to changes in the fair value of the derivative component as a result of changes in the underlying risk free interest rate 
if the risk free interest rate were to increase by from december  levels  the fair value of the derivative component would increase by approximately million  which would be recorded as an unrealized loss in our statements of consolidated operations 
centerpoint houston  as collection agent for the nuclear decommissioning charge assessed on its transmission and distribution customers  contributed million in both and to trusts established to fund texas genco s share of the decommissioning costs for the south texas project 
the securities held by the trusts for decommissioning costs had an estimated fair value of million as of december   of which approximately were debt securities that subject texas genco to risk of loss of fair value with movements in market interest rates 
if interest rates were to increase by from their levels at december   the fair value of the fixed rate debt securities would decrease by approximately million 
any unrealized gains or losses are accounted for by texas genco as a long term asset liability as texas genco will not benefit from any gains  and losses will be recovered through the rate making process 
equity market value risk we are exposed to equity market value risk through our ownership of million shares of tw common  which we hold to facilitate our ability to meet our obligations under the zens 
please read note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effect of adoption of sfas no 
on our zens obligation and our historical accounting treatment of our zens obligation 
a decrease of from the december  market value of tw common would result in a net loss of approximately million  which would be recorded as a loss in our statements of consolidated operations 
as discussed above under interest rate risk  centerpoint houston contributes to trusts established to fund texas genco s share of the decommissioning costs for the south texas project  which held approximately of total assets in equity securities as of december  the equity securities expose texas genco to losses in fair value 
if the market prices of the individual equity securities were to decrease by from their levels at december   the resulting loss to texas genco in fair value of these securities would be approximately million 
currently  the risk of an economic loss is mitigated as discussed above under interest rate risk 
commodity price risk from non trading activities to reduce our commodity price risk from market fluctuations in the revenues derived from the sale of natural gas and related transportation  we enter into forward contracts  swaps and options non trading energy derivatives in order to hedge some expected purchases of natural gas and sales of natural gas a portion of which are firm commitments at the inception of the hedge 
non trading energy derivatives are also utilized to fix the price of future operational gas requirements 
we use derivative instruments as economic hedges to offset the commodity exposure inherent in our businesses 
the stand alone commodity risk created by these instruments  without regard to the offsetting effect of the underlying exposure these instruments are intended to hedge  is described below 
we measure the commodity risk of our non trading energy derivatives using a sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis performed on our non trading energy derivatives measures the potential loss in earnings based on a hypothetical movement in energy prices 
a decrease of in the market prices of energy commodities from their december  levels would have decreased the fair value of our non trading energy derivatives by million 
a decrease of in the market prices of energy commodities from their december  levels would have decreased the fair value of our non trading energy derivatives by million 
the above analysis of the non trading energy derivatives utilized for hedging purposes does not include the favorable impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on our physical purchases and sales of natural gas to which the hedges relate 
furthermore  the non trading energy derivative portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction portfolio  reducing overall risks within limits 
therefore  the adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of non trading energy derivatives held for hedging purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above would be offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions  assuming the non trading energy derivatives are not closed out in advance of their expected term  the non trading energy derivatives continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk  and as applicable  anticipated underlying transactions settle as expected 
if any of the above mentioned assumptions ceases to be true  a loss on the derivative instruments may occur  or the options might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date  whichever comes first 
non trading energy derivatives designated and effective as hedges  may still have some percentage which is not effective 
the change in value of the non trading energy derivatives that represents the ineffective component of the hedges is recorded in our results of operations 
we have established a risk oversight committee  comprised of corporate and business segment officers  that oversees commodity price and credit risk activities  including trading  marketing  risk management services and hedging activities 
the committee s duties are to establish commodity risk policies  allocate risk capital  approve trading of new products and commodities  monitor risk positions and ensure compliance with the risk management policies and procedures and trading limits established by our board of directors 
our policies prohibit the use of leveraged financial instruments 
a leveraged financial instrument  for this purpose  is a transaction involving a derivative whose financial impact will be based on an amount other than the notional amount or volume of the instrument
