item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background fuel tech nv fuel tech is a technology company that provides advanced engineering solutions for the optimization of combustion systems in utility and industrial applications 
fuel tech currently generates revenues from the following product lines nitrogen oxide nox reduction technologies fuel tech markets a suite of nitrogen oxide nox reduction technologies 
these include the noxout  noxout cascade  and noxout scr processes which use the injection of chemicals to reduce nox emissions in flue gas from boilers  incinerators  furnaces and other stationary combustion sources to meet statutory nox reduction requirements worldwide 
fuel tech distributes its products through its direct sales force  licensees and agents 
the near term driver for growth in this business is the ozone transport sip state implementation plan call  which required states to decrease their nox emissions by may  this regulation impacts utility boilers and large industrial boilers see below for more detail on the sip call 
fuel tech believes that the implementation of the sip call will extend well beyond the may  implementation date 
fuel treatment chemicals fuel tech s proprietary targeted in furnace injection tifi technology centers on the unique application of specialty chemicals to improve the performance of combustion units 
specifically  this technology is used to address slagging  fouling  corrosion and plume abatement in furnaces and boilers through the injection of chemicals into the fuel or  via tifi 
fuel tech sells its fuel treatment chemicals through its direct sales force and agents to industrial and utility power generation facilities 
fuel tech believes its largest market opportunity for this product line is those units burning western coals  many of which have significant operational issues related to the formation of slag 
visualization software to further aid the accuracy and expediency with which process solutions could be designed and delivered to a customer  fuel tech internally developed a visualization software product called acuitiv 
the software allows users to visualize complex data sets in a three dimensional immersive environment 
the acuitiv software product was commercially introduced in the second quarter of the acuitiv product offering was designed to provide customers in several industries including automotive  aerospace and defense  chemical processing and energy  with the ability to uncover new opportunities  improve designs  accelerate decision making and shorten product development time to market 
in early acuitiv was discontinued as a commercial venture 
the software will continue to be maintained and utilized internally on a prospective basis because it is an essential tool in the design  marketing and sale of fuel tech s nox reduction and fuel chem product applications 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require fuel tech to make estimates and assumptions 
fuel tech believes that of its accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements the following involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity and are deemed critical 
fuel tech discusses its critical accounting policies with the audit committee 
revenue recognition fuel tech uses the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain long term equipment construction and license contracts 
under the percentage of completion method  sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual construction costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion 
since the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates that are assessed continually during the term of the contract  recognized sales and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
different results are possible when using different assumptions 
as part of most of its contractual project agreements  fuel tech will agree to customer specific acceptance criteria that relate to the operational performance of the system that is being sold to the customer 
these criteria are determined based on mathematical modeling that is performed by fuel tech personnel which is based on operational inputs that are provided by the customer 
the customer will warrant that these operational inputs are accurate as they are specified in the binding contractual agreement 
further  the customer is solely responsible for the accuracy of the operating condition information and  all performance guarantees and equipment warranties granted by fuel tech are void if the operating condition information is inaccurate or is not met 
fuel tech has installed over units with the technology and has never failed to meet a performance guarantee when the customer has provided the required operating conditions for the project 
as part of the project implementation process  fuel tech will perform system start up and optimization services which effectively serve as a test of actual project performance 
fuel tech believes that this test  combined with the accuracy of the modeling that is performed  enables revenue to be recognized prior to the receipt of formal customer acceptance 
allowance for doubtful accounts fuel tech  in order to control and monitor the credit risk associated with its customer base  reviews the credit worthiness of customers on a recurring basis 
factors influencing the level of scrutiny include the level of business the customer has with fuel tech  the customer s payment history and the customer s financial stability 
representatives of fuel tech s management team review all past due accounts on a weekly basis to assess collectibility 
at the end of each reporting period  the reserve balance is reviewed relative to management s collectibility assessment and is adjusted if deemed necessary 
fuel tech s historical credit loss has been insignificant 
assessment of potential impairments of goodwill and intangible assets effective january   fuel tech adopted fasb financial accounting standards board statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the guidance of this statement  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized  but rather  are required to be reviewed annually or more frequently if indicators arise  for impairment 
the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of the business to the recorded value 
fuel tech uses a discounted cash flow model dcf to determine the current fair value of its two reporting units 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows  including markets and market share  sales volumes and prices  costs to produce and working capital changes 
management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated 
however  actual fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 
fuel tech reviews other intangible assets  which include a customer list  a covenant not to compete and patent assets  for impairment on a recurring basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates of future cash flows are made  however  the actual cash values that could be realized may differ from those that are estimated 
valuation allowance for deferred income taxes deferred tax assets represent deductible temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
upon review of its potential sources of taxable income  fuel tech has concluded that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
fuel tech considers if there are taxable temporary differences that could generate taxable income in the future  if there is the ability to carryback the net operating loss  if there is a projection of future taxable income and  if there are any tax planning strategies which can be readily implemented 
fuel tech is a company whose revenues are generated from a customer base that is heavily regulated 
this fact lends some uncertainty to the ability of the company to project forward looking income with precision 
versus net sales for the months ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the year on year decline reflects a reduction in revenues derived from the nox reduction project product line 
revenues for this product line were million in versus million in as referred to in previous filings  although the environmental protection agency s epa sip state implementation plan call regulation became effective as of may   there were several factors that led to a slowing of equipment orders in the air pollution control business late in and during the first half of nox allowance prices for were depressed as a result of weak demand for power  the existence of a shortened ozone season and due to the allocation of supplemental nox allowances 
consequently  some utilities were able to delay capital spending related to nox control and they met their emissions reduction requirements on a short term basis through the purchase of allowances and other temporary means 
in addition  many utilities continued to experience significant capital constraints 
based on these market factors  the air pollution control business weakened during the latter portion of and the first half of as expected  the second half of began to show improvement with the receipt of several air pollution control project orders 
increased strength in this business is expected in and and fuel tech continues to work towards developing alliance agreements with critical customers looking to finalize their compliance plans 
the decline in nox reduction project revenues was partially offset by record fuel treatment chemical revenues 
revenues for the fuel chem product line increased to million from million in  an increase of almost 
revenues derived from western coal fired utility boilers had the largest year on year impact  and contributions from the customer contracts acquired from martin marietta magnesia specialties  llc on september   also contributed to the increase 
fuel tech believes that attaining success on additional western coal fired utility boilers will lead to more expedient penetration of the western coal fired utility market 
sales and marketing efforts are intensely focused on penetrating this market as it represents the largest opportunity for the fuel treatment chemical business 
the company s tifi targeted in furnace injection technology alleviates the slagging and fouling issues associated with burning coals that are high in low melting point ash constituents  such as sodium 
the sip call  introduced in  is the federal mandate that required states to reduce nox emissions by may on march   an appellate court of the dc circuit upheld the validity of the sip call for of the states and  on june   the same court made a final ruling upholding the epa s sip call regulation and denying the appeal of the states and utilities 
although the nox reduction requirement date was moved back one year to may   states were required to complete and issue their state implementation plans for nox reduction by october of these plans  which the epa had until october to approve  will potentially impact to utility boilers and to industrial units 
although the sip call was the subject of litigation  an appellate court of the dc circuit upheld the validity of this regulation 
this court s ruling was later affirmed by the us supreme court 
in february  the us supreme court  in a unanimous decision  upheld epa s authority to revise the national ambient air quality standard for ozone to parts per million averaged through an eight hour period from the current parts per million for a one hour period 
this more stringent standard provides clarity and impetus for air pollution control efforts well beyond the current ozone attainment requirement of in keeping with this trend  the supreme court  only days later  denied industry s attempt to stay the sip call  effectively exhausting all means of appeal 
on december   epa proposed a new regulation that affects the sip call states by calling for more nox reductions in and also  deep nox reductions are called for in additional states outside the current sip call region 
the proposed rule  called the interstate air quality rule  allows a cap and trade format similar to the sip call 
this rule  or one that is similar in nature  is expected to be passed in the near term 
based on these regulatory developments  fuel tech expects to enjoy continued demand for its air pollution technologies over the next several years 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales for the month period ended december  declined to from in the prior year due to two primary reasons 
first  a significantly larger percentage of the revenues for the month period ended december  were generated by the fuel treatment chemical product line 
the gross margins realized by the fuel treatment chemical product line are typically higher than the nox reduction project business 
secondarily  a larger percentage of the nox reduction project revenues generated for the month period ended december  were generated by nox reduction turnkey projects than in when fuel tech receives a nox reduction project order from a customer  the scope of the project can include two components 
first  there is the fuel tech equipment scope for a project and second  there is an installation scope for a project 
due to its patented technology  fuel tech s equipment scope for a project generates a higher gross margin than does the installation scope for a project 
historically  most nox reduction projects undertaken by fuel tech have not included the installation scope of a project and this portion of the work has been the responsibility of the end customer 
when fuel tech is responsible for both components of the project scope  the overall project margin is reduced 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  and  for the months ended december  and  respectively 
of the  increase   was due to employment related costs for sales and marketing personnel related to the fuel treatment chemical business 
market penetration of fuel tech s tifi technology in the coal fired utility market remains a strategic priority 
the remainder of the variance was due primarily to an increase in engineering expenses which was driven by the reduction in nox reduction project activity 
when engineering employees are specifically working on nox reduction projects their costs are classified as cost of sales 
research and development expenses were  and  for the months ended december  and  respectively 
fuel tech continues to pursue commercial applications for technologies related to its core businesses  with a particular focus on its fuel chem technologies 
there was no interest expense recorded for the month period ended december   while  was recorded during fuel tech paid off the entirety of its outstanding debt balance in the second quarter of other expense was  for the months ended december  versus other income of  for the months ended december  the decline is principally due to recording an impairment loss for certain patent assets in the amount of  in additionally  fuel tech had lower interest income in resulting from a lower average outstanding cash balance in versus fuel tech s income tax benefit of  for predominantly represents the recording of a  reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance representing the anticipated utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in subsequent years 
based on a review of both historical and projected taxable income fuel tech concluded that it is more likely than not that some portion of the net operating losses will be utilized in subsequent years and that a reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance was required 
the  in tax expense that offsets this amount primarily represents state income tax expense 
fuel tech did not record a financial impact from income taxes in versus net sales for the months ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the improvement was primarily attributable to the increase in fuel treatment chemical revenues  as this product line contributed revenues at a record level during fuel treatment chemical revenues increased by in to  million from million in within the fuel treatment chemical product line  revenues derived from western coal fired utility boilers had the largest year on year impact as additional customers were attained in this market segment 
additionally  positive contributions were attained from utilities burning oil  both in the united states and in foreign locations 
fuel tech believes that its success on several western coal fired utility boilers  along with intensely focused sales and marketing efforts and the utilization of strategic partners  will lead to further penetration of the western coal fired utility market in the near future 
the coal fired market represents the largest market opportunity for the fuel treatment chemical business and penetration into this market is a priority 
the company s tifi technology alleviates the slagging and fouling issues associated with burning coals that are high in low melting point ash constituents  such as sodium 
nox reduction project revenues in were million  which approximates the same level as even with the environmental protection agency s epa sip state implementation plan call regulation in place  two factors led to a slowing of equipment orders in the air pollution control business in the latter part of the year 
first  rulings related to new source review caused our utility customers to reassess their sip call compliance plans to ensure that they will meet their overall nox reduction requirements in the most cost effective manner 
although the company expects this recent ruling to benefit business in the future  the impact in the near term was a delay in the receipt of orders 
second  many utilities were experiencing significant capital constraints 
this  coupled with depressed nox allowance prices for  which were the result of weak demand for power and the existence of a shortened ozone season  caused some utilities to delay capital spending and to meet their requirements on a short term basis through the purchase of allowances and other temporary means 
based on these market factors  the air pollution control business did weaken during the latter portion of  and was expected to remain weak during the first half of cost of sales as a percentage of net sales for the month period ended december  was versus for the same period of the prior year 
this percentage increase reflected a change in product mix within the nox reduction project product line 
in  a significantly larger percentage of the nox reduction project revenues were generated by turnkey projects  which include both scope components of a project  versus the comparable period in as noted previously  when fuel tech receives a nox reduction project order from a customer  the scope of the project can include two components  fuel tech s equipment scope for a project and  an installation scope for a project 
when fuel tech is responsible for both components of the project scope  the overall project margin is reduced 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  to  for the month period ended december  from  for the same period of approximately  of the increase was due to employment related costs for sales and marketing personnel that were added in the latter half of and during to support the fuel treatment chemical product line 
market penetration of fuel tech s tifi targeted in furnace injection technology in the coal fired utility market remains a strategic priority 
to a lesser degree  approximately  of the increase was due to selling  general and administrative expenses incurred by fuel tech s foreign operations 
foreign expenses increased modestly in versus  however the strength of the euro in versus served to have a significant negative impact on us dollar reporting 
lastly  the remainder of the variance was attributable to administrative cost increases in a variety of cost categories including employment costs  insurance premiums  audit fees and director s fees 
research and development expenses for the months ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the decrease in research and development spending was due to the treatment of the acuitiv software business as a commercial enterprise commencing late in the third quarter of and thereafter 
prior to this date  this business was considered as a research and development effort 
interest expense for the months ended december  was reduced to  from  in the prior month period 
in the second quarter of the year  the company paid off the entirety of its outstanding debt balance 
other income and expense for the month period ended december  was  versus  for the same period in no provision for federal or state income taxes was recorded during the month period ended december  due to the existence of net operating loss carryforwards 
an income tax benefit of  was recorded in  which represented a reduction of the reserve for prior years state income tax refunds receivable  as the related receivables were collected in fuel tech had million in us federal income tax loss carryforwards as of december   the deferred tax benefit of which had been offset by a valuation allowance in fuel tech s balance sheet 
liquidity and sources of capital at december   fuel tech had cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of  versus  and  at the end of  respectively 
operating activities provided  of cash in primarily due to fuel tech s operating profit before depreciation and amortization 
investing activities used cash of  during the year 
of this amount   was used for equipment related to the fuel treatment chemical business  while the remainder primarily was used for test equipment  furniture and fixtures and other administrative related capital requirements 
lastly  fuel tech generated cash from the exercise of stock options in the amount of  fuel tech  inc fti had a million revolving credit facility expiring july   which was collateralized by all personal property owned by fti 
effective june   fti amended the facility to increase the line to million  and to extend the expiration date until july  fti can use this facility for cash advances and standby letters of credit 
cash advances under this facility bear interest based on the following the bank prime rate reduced by a range of zero to basis points  or the bank interbank offering rate increased by a range of to basis points the company can choose which rate to apply to borrowings 
at december   the bank had provided standby letters of credit  predominantly to customers  totaling approximately  in connection with contracts in process 
fti is committed to reimbursing the issuing bank for any payments made by the bank under these letters of credit 
at december   there were no cash borrowings under the revolving credit facility and approximately  was available for utilization 
interest payments were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
there were no required interest payments in in the opinion of management  fuel tech s expected near term revenue growth will be driven by the timing of penetration of the coal fired utility marketplace via utilization of its tifi technology  and by various entities implementation of the nox reduction requirements of the caaa 
fuel tech expects its liquidity requirements to be met by the operating results generated from these activities 
contractual obligations and commitments in its normal course of business  fuel tech enters into agreements that obligate fuel tech to make future payments 
the operating lease obligations noted below are primarily related to supporting the normal operations of the business and are not recognized as liabilities in fuel tech s consolidated balance sheet in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
payments due by period in thousands of us dollars contractual cash less than obligations total year years years thereafter operating leases  fuel tech has a sublease agreement that obligates the lessee to make future payments to fti 
the sublease obligations noted below are related to a sublease agreement between fti and american bailey corporation abc 
abc will reimburse fti for its share of lease and lease related expenses under fti s january  lease of its executive offices in stamford  connecticut 
please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the relation between fti and abc 
rental payments due to fti by period in thousands of us dollars contractual cash less than obligations total year years years thereafter sublease fuel tech  in the normal course of business  uses bank performance guarantees and letters of credit in support of construction contracts with customers as follows in support of the warranty period defined in the contract  or in support of the system performance criteria that are defined in the contract in addition  fuel tech uses letters of credit as security for other obligations as needed in the normal course of business 
as of december   fuel tech has outstanding bank performance guarantees and letters of credit as noted in the table below commitment expiration by period in thousands of us dollars commercial less than commitments total year years years thereafter standby letters of credit and bank guarantees forward looking information from time to time  information provided by fuel tech  statements made by its employees or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission including this annual report may contain statements that are not historical facts  so called forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of fuel tech s actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  product demand  pricing  market acceptance  litigation  risk of dependence on significant customers  third party suppliers and intellectual property rights  risks in product and technology development and other risk factors detailed in the text under the caption risk factors of the business in item business above part i of this annual report and in fuel tech s securities and exchange commission filings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk fuel tech s earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
fuel tech does not enter into foreign currency forward contracts or into foreign currency option contracts to manage this risk due to the immaterial nature of the transactions involved 
fuel tech is also exposed to changes in interest rates primarily due to its long term debt arrangement refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not have a materially adverse effect on interest expense during the upcoming year ended december
