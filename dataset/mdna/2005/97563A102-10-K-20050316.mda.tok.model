the company seeks to maximize the value of its portfolio through aggressive asset management  by directing the managers of its hotels to reduce operating costs and increase revenues  and by completing selective capital improvements

off balance sheet arrangements the company s off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of its ownership interest in its joint venture with charlesbank 
for a further discussion of this joint venture  and its effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flow  see critical accounting estimates  recently issued accounting standards and liquidity and capital resources 
critical accounting estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
accounts and notes receivable the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its hotel guests  mezzanine loan borrowers  and other borrowers to make required payments 
the company reviews its accounts receivable aging report on a monthly basis and discusses the status of receivable collections with appropriate hotel personnel to determine if additional allowances are necessary 
to analyze the collectibility of the notes receivable  the company reviews the monthly operating results of each respective hotel for which it has provided financing to ensure the borrower s equity is not being eroded 
the company also analyzes the operating results of the hotel to ensure that the estimated market value exceeds the total debt outstanding on the property 
if the financial results of the respective hotels were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
accounting for joint ventures as of december   the company had a ownership interest in its charlesbank joint venture  which in turn owned an ownership interest in its wcc project company llc joint venture and its wnc project company llc joint venture  a ownership interest in its marsh landing joint venture  and a interest in its chapel hill joint venture 
the wcc project company llc joint venture owned four hotels  the wnc project company llc joint venture owned one hotel  the marsh landing joint venture owned one hotel  and the chapel hill joint venture owned one hotel 
per the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  as of december  and  the company determined that the charlesbank joint venture did not have to be consolidated 
the company accounts for this joint venture under the equity method in accordance with statement of position  accounting for investments in real estate ventures 
the company recognized its share of net income or loss from this joint venture during and and adjusted the carrying value of its investment accordingly 
accordingly  the joint ventures assets  liabilities  and equity are not recorded on the company s balance sheet as of december  and the company determined that the marsh landing joint venture is considered to be a variable interest entity vie and the company is considered to be the primary beneficiary 
therefore  per the provisions of fin  the company has consolidated the assets and liabilities of this joint venture into its consolidated balance sheet as of december  and  and has consolidated the results of operations beginning with the first quarter of the chapel hill joint venture was created in august and is also considered to be a vie and the company is considered to be the primary beneficiary 
therefore  per fin  the company has consolidated the joint venture s assets  liabilities  and results of operations beginning with the third quarter accounting for long lived assets the company evaluates the potential impairment of its individual long lived assets  principally its wholly owned hotel properties and the hotel properties in which it owns an interest through consolidated joint ventures in accordance with fasb no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company records an impairment charge when it believes an investment in hotels has been impaired  such that the company s estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  together with its estimate of an anticipated liquidation amount  would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the hotel property  or when the company classifies a property as held for sale and the carrying value exceeds fair market value 
the company considers many factors and makes certain subjective assumptions when making this assessment  including but not limited to  general market and economic conditions  operating results over the past several years  the performance of similar properties in the same market and expected future operating results based on a variety of assumptions 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
in addition  if the company s assumptions regarding future undiscounted cash flows and anticipated liquidation amounts are incorrect  a future impairment charge may be required 
further  the company currently owns certain hotels for which the carrying value exceeds current market value 
the company does not believe an impairment charge for these hotels is appropriate since the company s forecast of future undiscounted cash flows  including an anticipated liquidation amount  exceeds the current carrying value 
however  should the company approve of a plan to sell these properties  an impairment charge would be required 
the company evaluates its investments in joint ventures for impairment by considering a number of factors including assessing current fair value of the investment to carrying value 
if the current fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value  and there is either an absence of an ability to recover the carrying value of the investment  or the property does not appear to have the ability to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment  am impairment charge may be required 
income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
because of expected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  the company has not recorded a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax asset as of december  should our estimate of future taxable income be less than expected  and or our tax planning strategy not be carried out as planned  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset in the period such determination was made

during the year ended december   the unaudited financial statements of the unconsolidated joint ventures reflected aggregate cash flow provided by operating activities of  cash used in investing activities of  principally for hotel additions  and cash provided by financing activities of  principally in the form of loan proceeds and capital contributions less distributions to joint venture partners 
during  the company spent  or of room revenue  in connection with the renovation of its wholly owned hotels and plans to spend approximately  during approximately  of the total capital expenditures expected to be made during is related to certain franchisor requirements 
these capital expenditures are funded from operating cash flow  and possibly from borrowings under the company s  line of credit with gecc the ge line  sources that are expected to be adequate to fund such capital requirements 
these capital expenditures are in addition to amounts spent on normal repairs and maintenance  which were approximately and of room revenues in and  respectively 
the company s net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  totaled  this amount included net proceeds of  as a result of the issuance of  shares of series b preferred stock  of which the company used  to redeem the  shares of series a preferred stock and  to pay the accrued dividends 
the net cash provided by financing activities also included the payment of additional distributions to shareholders of  the payment of distributions to the partnership s minority interest of  the payment of distributions to consolidated joint venture s minority interest of  net long term debt payments of  the payment of  of fees in connection with financing facilities and a net increase of  in the outstanding balance under the corporate line of credit from  at december  to  at december  during each quarter of  the company declared quarterly cash dividends of per common share 
during the first quarter of the company declared cash dividends of per series a preferred share for the period from january  through february  and per series b preferred share for the period from february  the issuance date of the new series b cumulative preferred stock through march  during each of the second  third and fourth quarters of  the company declared cash dividends of per series b preferred share 
in addition  on an annual basis  the company expects to have adequate cash flow from operations and from borrowings to fund its expected debt service  capital expenditures  and dividend obligations during the company s  line of credit the wachovia line bore interest at rates from libor plus to  based on the company s consolidated debt leverage ratio 
as of december   the wachovia line was collateralized with of the company s hotels  with a net book value of  during  the company increased the outstanding balance under its the wachovia line by  from  to  the company s articles of incorporation limit its debt to of the cost of its investment in hotel properties  or approximately  as of december  as noted under recent developments above  on march   the company  through its wholly owned subsidiary  winston spe ii llc spe ii  entered into a five year credit facility with general electric capital corporation gecc the ge line 
the company subsequently borrowed million under the ge line on march  and used these funds to pay off all outstanding debt under the company s wachovia line  terminating this prior credit facility 
the ge line provides for revolving loan commitments and letters of credit up to  the ge line bears interest at rates from libor plus to  based on the ratio of the underwritten net operating income of the hotels that collateralize the credit facility to the outstanding principal debt balance 
the current interest rate under the ge line is libor plus 
the company s availability under the ge line totaled approximately  as of march  total borrowings of  plus a  letter of credit were outstanding 
availability is calculated each quarter on a trailing twelve month basis based primarily upon the underwritten net operating income of the hotels that collateralize the ge line divided by 
if at any time the outstanding balance of the borrowings exceeds the lesser of  or spe ii s trailing twelve month underwritten net operating income  the company must repay the total outstanding advances to the extent required to eliminate such excess 
the ge line contains customary special purpose restrictions on spe ii 
as long as there is no event of default  there are no restrictions on the use of the loan proceeds  and the proceeds can be used as the company determines 
the ge line includes usual and customary events of default for facilities of this nature and provides that  upon and during the continuation of an event of default  all outstanding loans under the line of credit may be accelerated  gecc s commitments to make any further loans may be terminated and gecc may foreclose on the collateral 
in addition  upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default  all outstanding loans under the ge line will automatically become due and payable and the lender s commitments to make any further loans will automatically terminate 
the company has guaranteed the payment and performance by spe ii of certain obligations under the ge line 
borrowings under the ge line are collateralized by hotel properties owned by the company located in nine states 
in october  the company s wholly owned subsidiary  winston finance partners llc winston finance  entered into a  master repurchase agreement with marathon structured finance fund  lp marathon to finance the company s hotel loan investments assets on a short term basis 
under the agreement  winston finance will sell assets to marathon and agree to repurchase those assets on a date certain 
typically  the sale and repurchase price will be no more than of the value of the asset  except for development and redevelopment assets where the limit is of the asset value 
in general  the repurchase price will equal the original sales price of the asset plus accrued but unpaid interest 
the company typically will pay interest to marathon at libor plus basis points for loans made by the company to acquire existing hotels  and libor plus basis points  plus one percent of the total loan amount as an origination fee  for loans made by the company to develop new hotels or redevelop existing hotels 
marathon gets a security interest in each asset subject to the facility 
for more information regarding the marathon repurchase agreement and other debt facilities of the company  see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company had  in debt at december  that was subject to a fixed interest rate and fixed monthly payments with ge capital corporation 
this debt  a ten year loan with a year amortization period  carries an interest rate of 
all unpaid principal and interest are due on december  the ge capital loan was collateralized with of the company s hotels with a net book value of  as of december  the company recorded consolidated debt from joint ventures totaling  as of december  for further discussion of these debt facilities  see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
as required by the ge line  on march   the company entered into an interest rate cap agreement to eliminate the exposure to increases in day libor over on principal balances up to  outstanding 
the interest rate cap agreement terminates on october  on january   the company completed an interest rate swap on  of its outstanding variable rate debt under the wachovia line 
this swap began on march  and matured on february  this transaction effectively replaced the company s variable interest rate based on day libor on  of the line of credit with a fixed interest rate of 
as of december   the company s contractual obligations and commitments excluding obligations and commitments pursuant to the company s unconsolidated joint ventures were as follows payments due by period less than more than total year years years years contractual obligations long term debt long term debt of consolidated jv s corporate office lease total contractual obligations other commercial commitments line of credit total other commercial commitments the company operates in a manner intended to enable it to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code 
a reit that distributes at least of its taxable income to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions is not taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to shareholders 
based on our taxable income to shareholders  we were required to distribute approximately  in order to maintain our reit status as described above 
we distributed approximately  to common shareholders and  to preferred shareholders for the year ended december   which exceeded our required distributions 
the company expects to fund its short term cash needs  including distributions to shareholders  from operating cash flow and from borrowings under its ge line 
the company intends to continue to seek additional mezzanine loan opportunities  as well as other hotel loan opportunities in general  and to acquire and develop additional hotel properties that meet its investment criteria 
the company is continually evaluating such opportunities  as well as other investment opportunities including  but not limited to  the acquisition of assets that require substantial renovation and repositioning within a particular market 
it is expected that future hotel loans and acquisitions will be financed  in whole or in part  from borrowings under the ge line or the marathon line of credit  additional follow on offerings  joint venture agreements  the net sale proceeds of hotel properties and or from the issuance of other debt or equity securities 
there can be no assurances that the company will make any further hotel loans or any investment in additional hotel properties  or that any hotel development will be undertaken  or if commenced  that it will be completed on schedule or on budget 
furthermore  there can be no assurances that the company will be able to obtain any additional financing

seasonality the hotels operations historically have been seasonal in nature  reflecting higher occupancy during the second and third quarters 
this seasonality can be expected to cause fluctuations in the company s quarterly operating profits 
to the extent that cash flow from operations is insufficient during any quarter  due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenue  the company expects to utilize cash on hand or borrowings under its line of credit to make distributions to the equity holders 
forward looking statements this report contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
you can identify these statements by use of words like guidance  project  target  may  will  expect  anticipate  estimate  believes  continue or similar expressions 
these statements represent the company s judgment and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual operating results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements  including but not limited to the following risks changes in general economic conditions  properties held for sale will not sell  financing risks including the inability to obtain financing on favorable terms  if at all  development risks including the risks of construction delays and cost overruns  lower than expected occupancy  average daily rates  and gross operating margins  non issuance or delay of issuance of governmental permits  zoning restrictions  the increase of development costs in connection with projects that are not pursued to completion  non payment of hotel loans made to third parties  the failure to make additional hotel loans and investments in non distressed and distressed hotel assets  the failure to attract joint venture opportunities and other risks described under risk ractors below 
risk factors risks relating to our business our ability to make distributions to our shareholders depends upon the ability of our hotel managers to operate our hotels effectively 
in order to qualify as a reit  we cannot operate any hotel  or directly participate in the decisions affecting the daily operations of any hotel 
our third party managers under management agreements have direct control of the daily operations of our hotels 
we do not have the authority to directly control any particular aspect of the daily operations of any hotel eg  setting room rates 
thus  even if we believe our hotels are being operated in an inefficient or sub optimal manner  we may not be able to require a change to the method of operation 
our only alternative for changing the operation of our hotels may be to replace the third party manager of one or more hotels in situations where the applicable management agreement permits us to terminate the existing manager 
as a result of the company s acquisition through its trs lessee of the leasehold interests for of its hotels  effective july   for two of its hotels  effective july   and for one of its hotels effective march  the operating income loss of these hotels are included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
our income primarily depends upon the net operating income of our hotels 
our ability to make distributions to our shareholders depends on the ability of our hotel managers to generate sufficient revenues from our hotels in excess of operating expenses 
our managers will be affected by factors beyond their control  such as changes in the level of demand for rooms and related services of our hotels  their ability to maintain and increase gross revenues and operating margins at our hotels  and other factors 
as of december   of our hotels were managed by alliance 
therefore  any operating difficulties or other factors specifically affecting alliance s ability to maintain and increase gross revenues and operating margins at our hotels could significantly adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  our growth strategy contemplates additional hotel acquisitions that meet our investment criteria and selective development of hotels as market conditions warrant 
our ability to grow depends  in part  upon the ability of our third party managers to manage our current and future hotels effectively 
if the third party managers are not able to operate additional hotels at current staffing levels and office locations  they may need to hire additional personnel  engage additional third party managers and or operate in new geographic locations 
if the third party managers fail to operate the hotels effectively  our ability to generate income from the hotels would be adversely affected 
the events of september  and threat of additional terrorist attacks  as well as the weak us economic recovery  have adversely impacted the hotel industry generally  and we have experienced an adverse effect on our results of operations 
prior to september   our hotels had begun experiencing declining revenue per available room  or revpar  as a result of the slowing us economy 
the terrorist attacks of september  and more recent concerns about possible additional terrorist attacks  combined with the effects of the resulting recession and weak economic recovery  have led to a substantial reduction in business and leisure travel throughout the united states 
we cannot predict the extent to which additional terrorist attacks  concerns about possible additional terrorist attacks  and the weak economic recovery will continue to directly or indirectly impact the hotel industry or our operating results in the future 
depressed revpar at our hotels could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  our ability to fund capital improvements and renovations at our hotels and our ability to make dividend payments necessary to maintain our reit tax status 
additional terrorist attacks could have further material adverse effects on the hotel industry and our operations 
we may not have access to financing for acquiring or developing additional hotels  or for providing hotel loans 
our ability to pursue our growth strategy depends  in part  on our ability to finance additional hotel acquisitions and development and additional hotel loans 
we may not be able to fund growth solely from cash provided from operating activities because we must distribute at least of our taxable income each year to maintain our tax status as a reit and normally distribute in order to avoid paying corporate income tax and excise tax on undistributed income 
consequently  we rely upon the availability of debt or equity capital to fund hotel acquisitions and improvements and hotel loans 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting sufficient debt or equity financing at an acceptable cost to fund future growth 
we are subject to restrictions that may limit our ability to take advantage of expansion opportunities that we believe are attractive 
our ability to raise additional equity capital will depend on market conditions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise funds through a public or private offering at a time when we need access to funds 
we may seek alternative methods of funding expansion  such as joint venture development  however  we cannot assure you that such opportunities will be available when we need them or on acceptable terms 
we have a significant level of debt that may limit our ability to take certain actions 
we currently have a significant amount of debt 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our wachovia line and million outstanding under a fixed rate loan 
as of december   the total liabilities of our consolidated joint ventures were million million of which represented long term debt 
as of december   the total liabilities of our unconsolidated joint ventures were million million of which represented long term debt 
our proportionate share of the unconsolidated joint ventures total liabilities and long term debt equated to million and million  respectively 
our level of debt could have important consequences to you 
for example  it could impair our ability to obtain additional financing  if needed  for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes in the future  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt  thereby reducing our funds available for operations  future business opportunities and other purposes  place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt  restrict our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions  and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic  industry and business conditions 
if we do not have sufficient funds to repay our debt at maturity  it may be necessary for us to refinance our debt through additional debt financing  private or public offerings of debt securities or additional equity offerings 
if  at the time of any refinancing  prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates on refinancings  increases in interest expense could adversely affect our cash flow and  consequently  cash available for distribution to shareholders 
if we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms  we may be forced to dispose of hotels or other assets on disadvantageous terms  potentially resulting in losses and adverse effects on cash flow from operating activities 
if we are unable to make required payments of principal and interest on debt secured by our hotels  one or more of those properties could be foreclosed upon by the lender with a consequent loss of revenue and asset value 
our indebtedness imposes limitations on our operations and subjects us to risk of default 
on march   the company  through its wholly owned subsidiary  winston spe ii llc spe ii  entered into the ge line 
the company subsequently borrowed funds under the ge line on march  and used these funds to pay off all outstanding debt under the company s previous million line of credit  terminating this prior credit facility 
the ge line limits our borrowing availability to an amount based primarily upon the net operating income of the hotels that serve as collateral for the ge line 
as a result  on march   we had approximately million available for borrowing under our ge line  of which million was outstanding 
if the net operating income of the hotels provided as collateral declines  and our resulting availability under the ge line is less than the balance outstanding  we must repay the total outstanding advances to the extent required to eliminate the excess or provide additional collateral  which may not be available  to increase our borrowing availability to the total amount of debt we need  up to a maximum amount of million 
thirty seven of our wholly owned hotels have been pledged as collateral for our debt facilities  against the ge line and against the ge capital cmbs loan 
as of march   five of the company s wholly owned properties were unencumbered and remained eligible to be pledged as collateral for increased borrowing availability under the ge line 
in addition  our articles of incorporation limit our debt to of the cost of our investment in hotel properties  or approximately million as of december   which could limit our ability to use leverage in future investments 
the ge line contains customary special purpose restrictions on spe ii and includes usual and customary events of default for facilities of this nature 
the ge line further provides that  upon and during the continuation of an event of default  including our inability to repay the excess debt over our borrowing availability or provide additional collateral to increase our borrowing availability  all outstanding loans under the line of credit may be accelerated  the lender s commitments to make any further loans may be terminated and the lender may foreclose on the collateral 
in addition  upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default  all outstanding loans under the ge line will automatically become due and payable and the lender s commitment to make any further loans will automatically terminate 
rising interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow 
our borrowings under the ge line bear interest at a variable rate 
although we have entered into an interest rate cap agreement that limits our interest rate exposure to increases in day libor over on the outstanding debt under the ge line  increases in interest rates up to this limit could increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow 
certain of our individual hotel loans earn interest at fixed rates 
thus  in a period of rising interest rates  our interest expense would increase  while the interest we earn on our fixed rate debt investments would not change  adversely affecting our profitability 
in addition  the value of our fixed rate hotel loans would be impaired if market interest rates rose  which would make it difficult for us to sell the loans 
we also may incur debt in the future that bears interest at a variable rate or we may be required to refinance our existing debt at higher interest rates  both of which could also increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow 
we may not be able to complete development of new hotels on time or within budget 
we intend to develop additional hotel properties as suitable opportunities arise 
new project development is subject to a number of risks that could cause increased costs or delays in our ability to generate revenue from any development hotel  reducing our cash available for distribution to shareholders 
these risks include construction delays or cost overruns that may increase project costs  competition for suitable development sites and or the emergence of unanticipated competition from other hotels  uncertainties as to market demand or deterioration in market demand after commencement of development  receipt of zoning  land use  building  construction  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations  and substantial development costs in connection with projects that are not completed 
we may not be able to complete the development of any projects we begin and  if completed  our development and construction activities may not be completed in a timely manner or within budget 
we also intend to rehabilitate hotels that we believe are underperforming 
these rehabilitation projects will be subject to the same risks as development projects 
hotels that we develop have no operating history and may not achieve levels of occupancy that result in levels of operating income that provide us with an attractive return on our investment 
the new hotels that we develop have no operating history 
these hotels  both during the start up period and after they have stabilized  may not achieve anticipated levels of occupancy  average daily room rates  or gross operating margins  and could result in operating losses 
property ownership through joint ventures and partnerships could limit our control of those investments 
joint ventures or partnerships other than winn limited partnership involve risks not otherwise present for investments we make on our own 
it is possible that our co venturers or partners may have different interests or goals than we do at any time and that they may take actions contrary to our requests  policies or objectives  including our policy with respect to maintaining our qualification as a reit 
other risks of joint venture investment include impasses on decisions  because no single co venturer or partner has full control over the joint venture or partnership 
each of our venture partners for our existing joint venture properties has the right  after the first twelve months of the hotel s operation  to sell the hotel developed by the joint venture to us  or  if we elect not to purchase  to sell such hotel to a third party 
in addition  future joint ventures may include other restrictions on us  including requirements that we provide the joint venture with the right of first offer or right of first refusal to acquire any new property we consider acquiring directly 
our business could be disrupted if we need to find a new manager upon termination of an existing management agreement 
if our managers fail to materially comply with the terms of their management agreements  we have the right to terminate such management agreements 
upon termination  we would have to find another manager to manage the property 
we cannot operate the hotels directly due to federal income tax restrictions 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to find another manager or that  if another manager were found  we would be able to enter into new management agreements favorable to us 
there would be disruption during any change of hotel management that could adversely affect our operating results 
if we decide to sell hotels  we may not be able to sell those hotels on favorable terms 
we have sold six hotels during the past three years  four in and two in we also sold two additional hotels in january although none of our other hotels is currently under contract to sell  we may decide to sell additional hotels in the future 
we may not be able to sell such hotels on favorable terms  and such hotels may be sold at a loss 
as with acquisitions  we face competition for buyers of our hotel properties 
other sellers of hotels may have the financial resources to dispose of their hotels on unfavorable terms that we would be unable to accept 
if we cannot find buyers for any properties that are designated for sale  we will not be able to implement our divestiture strategy 
in the event that we cannot fully execute our divestiture strategy or realize the benefits therefrom  we will not be able to fully execute our growth strategy 
if third parties for whom we develop hotels default on their loans  we may be required to complete the development of those hotels at our own expense 
in certain cases where we are offering third party hotel development services in exchange for fees  we may elect to provide the hotel owner developer with a construction completion guaranty on the particular hotel under development 
in those cases  if the owner developer were in default under the terms and conditions of its senior loans  its senior lenders might seek to compel us to complete the development of the particular hotel with our own funds  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may face conflicts of interest relating to sales of hotels acquired from affiliates 
we have acquired hotels in the past from related parties of our affiliates  which include robert winston  our chief executive officer  and charles winston  our chairman of the board 
the limited partners of winn limited partnership  including robert winston and charles winston  may have unrealized gain associated with their interests in these hotels 
our sale of any of those hotels may cause adverse tax consequences to the limited partners 
therefore  our interests could conflict with the interests of the limited partners in connection with the disposition of one or more of those hotels  including limited partners who may be board members or otherwise in a position to exert influence over other board members who will determine whether we sell these hotels 
we depend on key personnel  the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our company 
we depend on the efforts and expertise of our chief executive officer  president and chief financial officer  chief accounting officer and chief operating officer to drive our day to day operations and strategic business direction 
the loss of any of their services could have an adverse effect on our operations 
our ability to replace key individuals may be difficult because of the limited number of individuals with the breadth of skills and experience needed to excel in the hotel industry 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to hire  train  retain or motivate such individuals 
risks related to hotel lending program the hotel mortgage loans that we originate are subject to delinquency  foreclosure and loss  which could result in losses to us 
some of our mortgage loans are secured by the hotel property and are subject to risks of delinquency and foreclosure  and risks of loss 
typically we have no recourse to the personal assets of our borrowers 
the ability of a borrower to repay a loan secured by an income producing property typically is dependent primarily upon the successful operation of the property rather than upon the existence of independent income or assets of the borrower 
if the net operating income of the property is reduced  the borrower s ability to repay the loan may be impaired 
net operating income of an income producing property can be affected by the risks particular to real property described below  as well as  among other things increased costs imposed on hotel owners by franchisors such as hot and cold breakfasts  new linens and other required improvements  property management decisions  property location and condition  competition from comparable types of properties  changes in specific industry segments  declines in regional or local real estate values  or occupancy rates  and increases in interest rates  real estate tax rates and other operating expenses 
in the event of any default under a mortgage loan held directly by us  we will bear a risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral and the principal and accrued interest of the mortgage loan  which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow from operations and limit amounts available for distribution to our stockholders 
in the event of the bankruptcy of a mortgage loan borrower  the mortgage loan to that borrower will be deemed to be secured only to the extent of the value of the underlying collateral at the time of bankruptcy as determined by the bankruptcy court  and the lien securing the mortgage loan will be subject to the avoidance powers of the bankruptcy trustee or debtor in possession to the extent the lien is unenforceable under state law 
foreclosure of a mortgage loan can be an expensive and lengthy process that could have a substantial negative effect on our anticipated return on the foreclosed mortgage loan 
we may also be forced to foreclose on properties outside of our traditional hotel investment expertise  be unable to sell these properties and be forced to incur substantial expenses to improve operations at the hotel 
the b notes in which we invest may be subject to additional risks relating to the privately negotiated structure and terms of the transaction  which may result in losses to us 
a b note is a mortgage loan typically i secured by a first mortgage on a single hotel or group of related properties and ii subordinated to an a note secured by the same first mortgage on the same collateral 
as a result  if a borrower defaults  there may not be sufficient funds remaining for b note holders after payment to the a note holders 
b notes reflect similar credit risks to comparably rated commercial mortgage backed securities 
however  since each transaction is privately negotiated  b notes can vary in their structural characteristics and risks 
for example  the rights of holders of b notes to control the process following a borrower default may be limited in certain investments 
we cannot predict the terms of each b note investment 
further  b notes typically are secured by a single property  and so reflect the increased risks associated with a single property 
b notes may also be illiquid  thus we may be unable to dispose of underperforming or non performing investments 
the higher risks associated with our subordinate position in our b note investments could subject us to increased risk of losses 
investments in mezzanine loans involve greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by income producing properties 
investments in mezzanine loans take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests in the entity that directly or indirectly owns the property 
these types of investments involve a higher degree of risk than a senior mortgage loan because the investment may become unsecured as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender 
in the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security  we may not have full recourse to the assets of the property owning entity  or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan 
if a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan  or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy  our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt is paid in full 
as a result  we may not recover some or all of our investment  which could result in losses 
in addition  mezzanine loans may have higher loan to value ratios than conventional mortgage loans  resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal 
our hotel lending program subjects us to the unique risks of a mezzanine lender 
a mezzanine lender has some of the same risks as a traditional real estate lender  such as lender liability for improperly exercising control over the borrower and environmental risks as a potentially responsible party liable for environmental damage in connection with the property owned by the borrower 
a mezzanine lender may enhance these risks by pursuing remedies on default that afford greater control over the operations of the borrower  especially if the mezzanine lender exercises its authority as a managing or co managing member 
courts have discretion to decline to enforce loan features which purport to limit or modify a mortgagor s right to redeem real estate after a mortgage default and before foreclosure by paying off the loan  and thus some remedies specified in our mezzanine loans may be unavailable to us 
in addition a borrower may allege that being in the position to control the borrowing entity creates duties by the lender to the borrower  including fiduciary like duties that may conflict with the lender s actions to exercise its remedies 
finally  to be able to protect its mezzanine loan  a mezzanine lender may have to advance additional funds to cure defaults on senior loans 
we may not have the ability to improve the operations of the hotel property once we exercise our control rights 
in some cases  we have made loans to hotels that do not fit our traditional investment criteria and may not have the appropriate expertise to manage these properties 
we may incur additional costs and resources which divert attention from our core operations 
risks relating to the real estate industry our performance and the value of our stock are subject to risks associated with the hotel industry 
our hotels are subject to operating risks of the hotel industry that could reduce our revenue  gross operating margins  and ability to make distributions to shareholders 
our hotels are subject to all operating risks common to the hotel industry 
these factors could adversely affect the ability of our hotels to generate operating income and therefore affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
these risks include  but are not limited to competition for guests from other hotels  many of which have substantial marketing and financial resources  faster growth in room supply than in room demand growth in our markets  increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors which may not be offset in the future by increased room rates  seasonality  with higher hotel revenues occurring in the second and third calendar quarters  increases in energy costs  airline fares and other expenses related to travel  which may deter traveling  terrorist incidents  which may also deter traveling  adverse effects of general and local economic conditions  a general inability to control costs  thereby resulting in lower gross operating profit  and risks generally associated with the ownership of hotels and real estate  as discussed below 
our entire business is concentrated in particular segments of a single industry 
our entire business is hotel related 
our investment strategies include acquiring additional hotels  or ownership interests in hotels  with strong national franchise affiliations in the mid scale without food and beverage  upscale  and upper upscale market segments  or hotel properties with the potential to obtain such franchise affiliations 
therefore  a downturn in the hotel industry  in general  and the segments in which we operate  in particular  will have a material adverse effect on our income and the amounts available for distribution to our equity holders 
large scale military deployments may adversely impact the occupancy rates and revenues from our two hotels located in communities that have a large military population 
currently  we own two hotels located in communities with a large military presence  one near fort bragg in fayetteville  north carolina and one near camp lejeune in jacksonville  north carolina 
during the persian gulf war in the early s  a large number of military personnel deployed to the persian gulf and  additionally  their respective families departed those communities for the duration of the military member s deployment 
the two local communities suffered economic loss as a result 
if a large number of military personnel were deployed away from their permanent duty stations for an extended period  we expect that occupancy rates and revpar at those two hotels would be adversely affected 
we may incur higher costs as a result of the proximity of our hotels to the coast 
several of our hotels are located near the atlantic ocean and are exposed to more severe weather than hotels located inland 
these hotels are also exposed to salt water and humidity  which can increase or accelerate wear on the hotels weatherproofing and mechanical  electrical and other systems 
as a result  we may incur additional expenditures for capital improvements 
our hotel concentration in the southeastern united states subjects us to increased risks than if our portfolio were more geographically diversified 
at december   out of our wholly owned hotels were located in the five eastern seaboard states ranging from virginia to florida  including hotels located in north carolina 
adverse events in these areas  such as economic recessions  hurricanes or other natural disasters  could cause a loss of revenues from these hotels  which could have a greater adverse effect on us as a result of our concentration of assets in this area 
our geographic concentration also exposes us to risks of oversupply and competition in our principal markets 
each of our hotels competes with other hotels in its market area 
a number of additional hotel rooms will continue to be built in the markets in which our hotels are located  which could result in too many hotel rooms in those regions 
significant increases in the supply of hotel rooms without corresponding increases in demand can have a severe adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
conditions of franchise agreements could adversely affect us 
all of our hotels are operated pursuant to franchise agreements with nationally recognized hotel brands 
in addition  hotels in which we subsequently invest may be operated pursuant to franchise agreements 
a hotel s failure to adhere to the terms and conditions of the franchise agreement could result in the loss or cancellation of its franchise license 
we rely on our managers to conform to such franchisor standards 
the franchise agreements generally contain specific standards for  and restrictions and limitations on  the operation and maintenance of a hotel in order to maintain uniformity within the franchisor s system 
these standards are subject to change over time  in some cases at the discretion of the franchisor  and may restrict our ability to make improvements or modifications to a hotel without the consent of the franchisor 
in addition  compliance with these standards could require us to incur significant expenses or capital expenditures even if we do not believe the capital improvements are necessary or desirable or will result in an acceptable return on our investment 
recently our franchisors have required improvements to our hotels  such as the provision of hot breakfasts and higher quality linens 
these improvements have proven costly but have not necessarily marginally increased our revpar  or revenue per available room 
our cash available for distribution could be adversely affected if we must incur substantial costs to maintain a franchise license 
if a franchise license terminates due to our failure to make required improvements or to otherwise comply with its terms  we may be liable to the franchisor for a termination payment 
these termination payments would vary by franchise agreement and by hotel 
the loss of a number of franchise licenses and the related termination payments could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   of the hotels franchise licenses  including seven joint venture hotels  ten expire in the next five years  one expires in  two expire in  four expire in  and three expire in in connection with the expiration of a franchise license or changing the franchise affiliation of a hotel  we may have to incur significant expenses or capital expenditures 
moreover  the loss of a franchise license  in the event that it could not be renewed or is otherwise lost  could have a material adverse effect on the operations and or the underlying value of the hotel covered by the franchise because of the loss of association  name recognition  marketing support and centralized reservation system provided by the franchisor 
any of these events could have a negative effect on our ability to make distributions to shareholders 
the franchise agreements covering the hotels expire or terminate  without special renewal rights  at various times and have different remaining terms 
operating costs and capital expenditures could adversely affect our cash flow 
hotels have an ongoing need for renovations and other capital improvements  particularly in older structures  including periodic replacement of furniture  fixtures and equipment 
we are obligated to pay the cost of certain capital expenditures at the hotels and to pay for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
franchisors also may require periodic capital improvements to our hotels as a condition of retaining the franchise licenses 
in addition  we intend to invest selectively in hotels that require significant renovation 
renovation of hotels involves certain risks  including the possibility of environmental problems  construction cost overruns and delays  uncertainties as to market demand or deterioration in market demand after commencement of renovation  the emergence of unanticipated competition from other hotels  and displacement of room revenues due to rooms being out of order 
if any of these costs exceed our estimates  the additional costs could have an adverse effect on our cash available for distribution 
we must compete with larger entities for acquisition and franchising opportunities 
we compete for acquisition opportunities with entities that have substantially greater financial resources than we do 
these entities generally may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage  including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a hotel operator or the geographic proximity of its investments  and may have better relations with franchisors 
competition may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us and increase the bargaining power of sellers 
in addition  other potential buyers who do not need to use a lessee or a third party operator to operate the hotel may be able to offer a higher price for a property than we are able to pay 
our performance and value are subject to the condition of the real estate industry 
we may not be able to sell hotels when appropriate 
real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly 
we may not be able to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic and other conditions 
because we are a reit  federal income tax laws limit our ability to sell properties in some situations when it may be economically advantageous to do so 
as a result  returns to our shareholders could be adversely affected 
in addition  we cannot assure you that the market value of any of our hotels will not decrease in the future  and therefore we may not be able to sell our hotels on favorable terms 
liability for environmental matters could adversely affect our financial condition 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of investigation and removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on  under  originating at or in the property  including fixtures  structures and other improvements located on the property 
these laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of or should have known of  or caused  the presence of contaminants 
although phase i environmental site assessments esas were obtained on all of the hotels  the phase i esas did not include invasive procedures  such as soil sampling or ground water analysis 
while the phase i esa reports have not revealed any environmental condition  liability or compliance concern that the company believes would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  assets or results of operations  it is possible that these reports do not reveal all environmental conditions  liabilities or compliance concerns or that there are material environmental conditions  liabilities or compliance concerns that arose at a hotel after the related phase i esa report was completed of which the company is unaware 
the costs to clean up a contaminated property  to defend against a claim  or to comply with environmental laws could be material and could affect the funds available for distributions to equity holders 
clean up costs and the owner s or operator s liability generally are not limited under these laws and could exceed the value of the property and or the aggregate assets of the owner or operator 
in addition  the presence of  or failure to properly remediate  contaminants may adversely affect the owner s ability to sell or rent the property or borrow using the real property as collateral 
persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the clean up costs of the substances at the disposal or treatment facility  whether or not the facility is or ever was owned or operated by that person 
environmental  health and safety laws and common law principles also govern the presence  effects  maintenance and removal of hazardous substances  including asbestos containing materials  or acms 
asbestos has been found in two of our hotels and asbestos or other hazardous substances may be found in other hotels we own or acquire in the future 
many such laws permit third parties  including employees and independent contractors  to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances  including acms 
in connection with the ownership of the hotels  we may be considered an owner or operator and therefore may be potentially liable for any such costs  which could adversely affect our financial condition 
black mold claims could adversely affect our financial condition 
recent publicity regarding families abandoning their homes because of the presence of stachyhotrys chartarum black mold has raised public consciousness regarding black mold 
black mold is a greenish black fungus found worldwide that grows in such places as dry wall  carpet  wall paper  fiber board  ceiling tiles  and thermal insulation when the relative humidity is above 
while the scientific community lacks consensus on the health threat  if any  posed by exposure to black mold  if black mold is detected in any of our hotels  we may be subject to adverse publicity  which could adversely affect our operations and financial results from that hotel 
such claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or pay significant damages 
in addition  we may be required to close all or portions of the affected hotel during mold remediation operations  generally consisting of a thorough cleaning with chlorine bleach and water 
under certain conditions  black mold may be difficult to eradicate and require us to remove and replace moldy materials in the hotel 
in extreme cases  it may be necessary to perform extensive facility repairs 
the presence of black mold in any hotel also could adversely impact the fair market value of that hotel 
during  the company invested in the beachwood  oh courtyard by marriott hotel  which is currently owned by wcc project company llc 
the company s current indirect ownership interest in this hotel is 
prior to making its initial investment  the company knew that black mold existed at the hotel and engaged consultants with expertise in black mold remediation and performed extensive research to satisfy itself that the black mold condition could be eradicated through renovation and repair procedures 
following the completion of such remediation procedures  the company believes that all of the black mold has been removed from this hotel 
the hotel opened in april because black mold is a naturally occurring fungus  the spores of which can be transported by outside air currents  there can be no assurances that black mold will not again enter and grow in this hotel or that it will not be found in the company s other hotel properties 
liability for underground storage tanks could adversely affect our financial condition 
portions of the soil and groundwater under the durham  nc hampton inn have been contaminated by one or more leaking underground storage tanks from an adjacent property owned by a third party 
the north carolina department of environmental and natural resources classified the adjacent property as low risk and issued a no further action determination in november a phase ii esa file review was conducted in february to review and obtain regulatory files related to the leaking underground tanks on the adjacent property 
the phase ii indicated that the durham  nc hampton inn is restricted from use of groundwater and recommended additional investigation to determine the extent of contamination  if any  from the leaking tanks 
we expect to conduct such additional investigation in the near future 
we believe liability for future cleanup  if any  of this subsurface contamination most likely would be imposed on the third party owner of the leaking underground storage tanks and not us 
we could  however  be responsible for cleanup of this site if  for instance  the owner of the leaking tanks refused or were financially unable to conduct a cleanup 
in addition to the costs of cleanup  environmental contamination can affect the value of a property and  therefore  an owner s ability to borrow funds using the property as collateral or to sell the property 
the costs to clean up a contaminated property  to defend against a claim  or to comply with environmental laws could be material and could adversely affect the funds available for distribution to our shareholders 
we can make no assurances that future laws or regulations will not impose material environmental liabilities or the current environmental condition of our hotel properties will not be affected by the condition of the properties in the vicinity of our hotel properties such as the presence of leaking underground storage tanks or by third parties unrelated to us 
liability for uninsured and underinsured losses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in the event of a substantial loss  our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of our lost investment 
certain types of losses  such as mold  terrorist acts  earthquakes  floods  hurricanes  and other acts of god  may be uninsurable or not economically insurable 
in addition  we may not be able to use insurance proceeds to replace a damaged or destroyed property as a result of changes in building codes and ordinances  environmental considerations or other factors 
in these circumstances  any insurance proceeds we receive might not be adequate to restore our economic position with respect to the damaged or destroyed property and we would be required to seek separate financing for repair and replacement costs  which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all  or face a loss on our investment 
the cost of compliance with the americans with disabilities act and other changes in governmental rules and regulations could adversely affect our cash flow 
under the americans with disabilities act of  or the ada  all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
a determination that we are not in compliance with the ada could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants 
in addition  other governmental rules and regulations or enforcement policies affecting the use and operation of the hotels could change  including changes to building codes and fire and life safety codes 
if we are required to spend money to comply with the ada or other changes in governmental rules and regulations  our ability to make distributions to shareholders could be adversely affected 
increases in property taxes could adversely affect our cash flow 
real and personal property taxes on our current and future hotel properties may increase as property tax rates change and as the properties are assessed or reassessed by taxing authorities 
an increase in property taxes could have an adverse effect on our ability to make distributions to shareholders 
risks relating to an investment in our capital stock the price of our securities may be affected by changes in market interest rates 
one of the factors that may influence the price of our common stock or preferred stock in public trading markets is the annual yield from distributions on our common stock or preferred stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments 
thus  an increase in market interest rates will result in higher yields on other financial instruments  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock or preferred stock 
the ability of our shareholders to effect a change in control is limited 
stock ownership limitations could inhibit changes in control 
our articles of incorporation provide that no shareholder may own  directly or indirectly  more than of any class of our outstanding stock without the approval of our board of directors 
this limitation may have the effect of precluding an acquisition of control by a third party without the approval of our board of directors even if a change in control were in our shareholders best interest 
our ability to issue preferred stock could inhibit changes in control 
our articles of incorporation authorize the board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to establish the preferences and rights of any shares of preferred stock issued 
currently  there are  shares of preferred stock outstanding 
issuing additional preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control even if a change in control were in our shareholders best interest 
risks relating to reit status we are subject to tax risks as a result of our reit status 
we have operated and intend to continue to operate so as to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
our continued qualification as a reit will depend on our continuing ability to meet various requirements concerning the ownership of our outstanding stock  the nature of our assets  the sources of our income  and the amount of distributions to our shareholders 
in order to qualify as a reit  we generally are required each year to distribute to our shareholders at least of our taxable income  other than any net capital gain and any taxable income of our trs lessees except to the extent that our trs lessees distribute their taxable income to us 
to the extent that we meet the distribution requirement  but distribute less than of our taxable income  we will be required to pay income tax on our undistributed income 
in addition  we will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount we pay out to our shareholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the federal tax laws 
our trs lessees will incur corporate income tax on their taxable income  but will not be subject to any distribution requirement 
the requirement to distribute a substantial portion of our net taxable income could cause us to distribute amounts that otherwise would be spent on future acquisitions  unanticipated capital expenditures or repayment of debt  which would require us to borrow funds or to sell assets to fund the costs of such items 
we have made  and intend to continue to make  distributions to our shareholders to comply with the distribution requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the nondeductible excise tax 
our income consists of our share of the income of winn limited partnership  and our cash available for distribution consists of our share of cash distributions from winn limited partnership  less capital expenditures and principal debt payments 
differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the receipt of cash available for distribution due to the seasonality of the hotel industry could require us to borrow funds on a short term basis to meet the distribution requirement and to avoid income tax and the nondeductible excise tax 
if we were to fail to qualify as a reit for any taxable year  we would not be allowed to deduct our distributions to our shareholders in computing our taxable income 
furthermore  we would be subject to federal income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
unless we are entitled to relief under the federal income tax laws  we also would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost our qualification 
as a result  our cash available for distribution would be reduced for each of the years involved 
although we currently operate and intend to continue to operate in a manner designed to qualify as a reit  it is possible that future economic  market  legal  tax or other considerations may cause our board of directors  with the consent of shareholders holding at least two thirds of the common stock entitled to vote  to revoke the reit election
