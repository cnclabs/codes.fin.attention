cincinnati bell inc the company provides diversified telecommunications services through businesses in five segments local  wireless  hardware and managed services  other and broadband 
a further discussion of these segments and their operating results is discussed in item  business  and in the individual segment discussions which begin on page of this report on form k 
executive summary cincinnati bell inc is a full service local provider of data and voice communications services and equipment and a regional provider of wireless and long distance communications services 
the company provides telecommunications service on its owned local network with a well regarded brand name and reputation for service 
the company operates in five business segments local  wireless  hardware and managed services  other and broadband 
in  the company s primary objectives were to reduce indebtedness  defend the company s core franchise against increasing competition  and add to the company s growth businesses 
measurements of the company s performance against these objectives are as follows reduced total indebtedness by  from  million to  million  primarily with operating cash flows 
defended its core franchise through bundling  adding  net subscribers to its custom connections sm super bundle which offers local  long distance  wireless  dsl and the company s value added service package  complete connections  on a single bill at a price lower than that for which the customer could buy all of the services individually 
the company finished the year with  super bundle subscribers  or more than at the end of in addition  total access lines declined by versus  a full percentage point improvement over the annual decline reported in the prior year as the company experienced little impact from cable telephony competition 
increased internet revenues by million by adding  digital subscriber line dsl subscribers  or more than were added in the company finished the year with  dsl subscribers  or more than at the end of penetration of its dsl product increased by  to of total owned facilities access lines 
for  the company expects to continue execution against the same objectives 
in early  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company completed the first stage of its refinancing plan  the primary objective of which is to increase cash flows by providing the flexibility with regard to the future extinguishment of its senior subordinated discount notes due the notes 
these notes mature in january and are callable at of their accreted value in march regarding defense of its core franchise  the company expects continued growth of its super bundle 
to build on the success of its bundled solutions over the past several years  the company plans to invest in enhanced billing and customer care platforms that will further automate operations and enable the company to provide better service at lower cost 
as a result of this planned investment in customer service  the company announced a restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of  continuing through to better align its cost structure with the future bundling opportunity 
the company believes this strategy will maintain its reputation for quality service and reduce annual operating expenses by to million by critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
the company continually evaluates its estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to revenue recognition  costs of providing service  bad debts  inventories and any related reserves  income taxes  fixed assets  goodwill  intangible assets  depreciation  restructuring  pensions  other postretirement benefits and contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies impact the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
additionally  the company s senior management has discussed the critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit and finance committee 
for a more detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue as services are provided 
local access fees are billed monthly  in advance  while revenue is recognized as the services are provided 
postpaid wireless  long distance  switched access  reciprocal compensation and data and internet product services are billed monthly in arrears  while the revenue is recognized as the services are provided 
the company bills service revenue in regular monthly cycles  which are dispersed throughout the days of the month 
because the day of each billing cycle rarely coincides with the end of the company s reporting period for usage based services such as postpaid wireless  long distance and switched access  the company must estimate service revenues earned but not yet billed 
the company bases its estimates upon historical usage and adjusts these estimates during the period in which the company can determine actual usage  typically in the following reporting period 
these adjustments may have a material impact upon operating results of the company during the period of the adjustment 
the company recognizes equipment revenue generally upon customer receipt or if contractually specified upon the performance of contractual obligations  such as shipment  delivery  installation or customer acceptance 
prior to the sale of the broadband assets in the second and third quarter of  broadband transport services were billed monthly  in advance  while revenue was recognized as the services were provided 
in addition  the company had entered into indefeasible right of use iru agreements  which represent the lease of network capacity or dark fiber  recording unearned revenue at the earlier of the acceptance of the applicable portion of the network by the customer or the receipt of cash 
the buyer of iru services typically paid cash or other consideration upon execution of the contract  and the associated iru revenue was recognized over the life of the agreement as services were provided  beginning on the date of customer acceptance 
in the event the buyer of an iru terminated a contract prior to the contract expiration and released the company from the obligation to provide future services  the remaining unamortized unearned revenue was recognized in the period in which the contract was terminated 
concurrent with the broadband asset sale  substantially all of the remaining iru obligations were assumed by the buyer of the broadband assets 
income taxes the income tax provision consists of an amount for taxes currently payable and an amount for tax consequences deferred to future periods 
as of december   the company had million in net deferred tax assets 
the ultimate realization of the deferred income tax assets depends upon the company s ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which basis differences and other deductions become deductible and prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   the company had billion in federal tax net operating loss carryforwards  with a deferred tax asset value of million 
the tax loss carryforwards are available to the company to offset taxable income in current and future periods 
the company expects to utilize approximately million of gross federal tax net operating loss carryforwards during the tax loss carryforwards will generally expire between and and are not currently limited under u 
s 
tax laws 
based on current income levels and anticipated future reversal of existing temporary differences  the company will utilize its federal net operating loss carryforwards within their expiration periods 
in addition  the company has state and local deferred tax assets of million  million of which relates to tax operating loss carryforwards 
the company has a million valuation allowance related to these state and local tax assets 
this allowance was provided due to uncertainties about the ultimate realization of certain state and local tax loss carryforwards prior to their expiration 
the company determines its effective tax rate by dividing its income tax expense by its net income before taxes as reported in its statement of operations 
for reporting periods prior to the end of the company s fiscal year  the company records income tax expense based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate 
this rate is computed using the statutory tax rate and an estimate of annual net income adjusted for an estimate of non deductible expenses 
the company has certain non deductible expenses  including interest expense related to securities issued to acquire its broadband business 
during these non deductible expenses were offset by benefits recorded to reduce the state deferred tax valuation allowance due to changes in utilization estimates of state net operating loss carryforwards 
excluding the effects of the reduction in the state valuation allowance  the company s effective tax rate would exceed statutory rates and the effective rate will vary inversely with the amount of its income before tax 
allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable the company estimates the allowances for uncollectible accounts using both percentages of aged accounts receivable balances to reflect the historical average of credit losses and specific provisions for certain large  potentially uncollectible balances 
the company believes its allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate based on the methods previously described 
however  if one or more of the company s larger customers were to default on its accounts receivable obligations or general economic conditions in the company s operating area deteriorated  the company could be exposed to potentially significant losses in excess of the provisions established 
substantially all of the company s outstanding accounts receivable balances are with entities located within its geographic operating areas 
regional and national telecommunications companies account for the remainder of the company s accounts receivable balances 
no one entity or collection of legally affiliated entities represents of the outstanding accounts receivable balances 
estimated useful lives and depreciation of property  plant and equipment the company s provision for depreciation of telephone plant is determined on a straight line basis using the whole life and remaining life methods 
provision for depreciation of other property  other than leasehold improvements  is based on the straight line method over the estimated economic useful life 
depreciation of leasehold improvements is based on a straight line method over the lesser of the economic useful life or term of the lease  including option renewal periods if renewal of the lease is probable 
repairs and maintenance expense items are charged to expense as incurred 
the company estimates the useful lives of plant and equipment in order to determine the amount of depreciation and amortization expense to be recorded during any reporting period 
the majority of the local segment plant and equipment is depreciated using the group method  which develops a depreciation rate annually based on the average useful life of a specific group of assets rather than for each individual asset as would be utilized under the unit method 
the estimated life of the group changes as the composition of the group of assets and their related lives changes 
such estimated life of the group is based on historical experience with similar assets  as well as taking into account anticipated technological or other changes 
if technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated or in a different form than anticipated  the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened  resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense in future periods 
likewise  if the anticipated technological or other changes occur more slowly than expected  the life of the group could be extended based on the life assigned to new assets added to the group 
this could result in a reduction of deprecation and amortization expense in future periods 
a one year decrease or increase in the useful life of these assets would increase or decrease depreciation and amortization expense by approximately million and million  respectively 
the company has reviewed these types of assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable over the remaining lives of the assets 
in assessing impairments  the company follows the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas during the fourth quarter of  the company revised the estimated economic useful life of its wireless tdma network due to the expected migration of its tdma customer base to its gsm gprs network 
the company shortened its estimate of the remaining economic useful life of its tdma network to december  this has resulted in a million increase in accumulated depreciation during if the migration to gsm gprs technology occurs more rapidly than the company s current estimates and the existing tdma network can not be effectively redeployed  the company may be required to revise its estimate further or record an impairment charge related to its tdma network 
technological change  which occurs more rapidly than expected  may have the affect of shortening the estimated depreciable life of other network and operating assets that the company employs 
this could have a substantial impact on the consolidated depreciation expense and net income of the consolidated company 
prior to the beginning of  the company estimated net removal costs for outside plant assets of cbt and to the extent these costs exceeded gross salvage values  the company increased its periodic depreciation expense to capture the difference between estimated net removal costs and gross salvage values in accumulated depreciation 
when the company retired these assets and expended the net removal costs  the company recognized net removal costs as a reduction to accumulated depreciation 
in connection with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas  effective january   the company removed the then existing accrued costs for the removal of outside telephone plant from the accumulated depreciation accounts 
these accrued costs totaled million  net of taxes  which the company recognized as income 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
since the company had previously accrued for net removal costs in excess of salvage value in depreciation expense  depreciation expense for cbt was million lower in than it would have otherwise been absent this accounting change 
in total  cbt s depreciation expense declined by million in from million in to in cbt expensed million of cost of products and services in related to net removal costs in excess of salvage value 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price consideration over the fair value of assets acquired recorded in connection with purchase business combinations 
indefinite lived intangible assets consist primarily of federal communications commission fcc licenses for spectrum of the wireless segment 
the company determined that its wireless licenses met the definition of indefinite lived intangible assets under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  as the company believes the need for wireless spectrum will continue independent of technology and the company may renew the wireless licenses in a routine manner every ten years for a nominal fee  provided the company continues to meet the service and geographic coverage provisions required by the fcc 
upon the adoption of sfas on january   the company ceased amortization of remaining goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
pursuant to sfas  goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually  or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
for goodwill  a two step impairment test is performed 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill is in excess of the implied fair value of that goodwill  then an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess 
for indefinite lived intangible assets  the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
during and  no write down in the carrying value of goodwill was required based on its fair value 
fair value is an estimate based on the present value of an expected range of future cash flows 
the expected range of future cash flows is based on internal forecasts developed utilizing management s knowledge of the business and the anticipated effects of market forces 
the discount rate used to determine the present value is based on the weighted average cost of capital in addition to a spread for other external market risks 
reducing the estimated fair value of goodwill by would not have resulted in an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill 
during and  no write downs in the carrying values of indefinite lived intangible assets were required based on their fair values 
indefinite lived intangible assets consists of fcc licenses of the wireless segment 
fair value is based on current external market rates for similar licenses 
a reduction in the estimated fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets would not result in an impairment of the carrying value of the licenses 
impairment of long lived assets  other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles the company reviews the carrying value of long lived assets  other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets discussed above  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset or group of assets and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount 
an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
competition from new or more cost effective technologies could affect the company s ability to generate cash flow from its network based services 
this competition could ultimately result in an impairment of certain of the company s tangible or intangible assets 
this could have a substantial impact on the operating results of the consolidated company 
pension and postretirement benefits the company calculates net periodic pension and postretirement expenses and liabilities on an actuarial basis under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits sfas 
the key assumptions used in determining these calculations are disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the actuarial assumptions attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expenses and liabilities related to these plans 
the most significant of these numerous assumptions  which are reviewed annually  include the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates 
the discount rate is selected based on current market interest rates on high quality  fixed income investments at december of each year 
the health care cost trend rate is based on actual claims experience and future projections of medical cost trends 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to the changing market and economic conditions and other changes 
revisions to and variations from these estimates would impact assets  liabilities  costs of services and products and selling  general and administrative expenses 
the following table represents the sensitivity of changes in certain assumptions related to the company s pension and postretirement plans pension benefits postretirement and other benefits dollars in millions point change increase decrease in obligation increase decrease in expense increase decrease in obligation increase decrease in expense discount rate expected return on assets health care cost trend rate n a n a the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  developed using the building block approach  is based on the following the participant s benefit horizons  the mix of investments held directly by the plans  which is generally equities and bonds  and  the current view of expected future returns  which is influenced by historical averages 
the required use of an expected versus actual long term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized pension expense or income that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year 
over time  however  the expected long term returns are designed to approximate the actual long term returns 
to the extent the company changed its estimate of the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  there would be an impact on pension expense or income and the associated net liability or asset 
in its pension calculations  the company utilizes the market related value of plan assets  which is a calculated asset value that recognizes changes in asset fair values in a systematic and rational manner 
differences between actual and expected returns are recognized in the market related value of plan assets over five years 
changes in actual asset return experience and discount rate assumptions can impact the company s operating results  financial position and cash flows 
actual asset return experience results in an increase or decrease in the asset base and this effect  in conjunction with a decrease in the pension discount rate  may result in a plan s assets being less than a plan s accumulated benefit obligation abo 
the abo is the present value of benefits earned to date and is based on past compensation levels 
the company is required to show in its consolidated balance sheet a net liability that is at least equal to the abo less the market value of plan assets 
this liability is referred to as an additional minimum pension liability aml 
an aml  which is recorded and updated on december each year  is reflected as a long term pension liability with the offset recorded as an intangible asset  to the extent the company has unrecognized prior service costs  with the remainder recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet  net of tax 
with regards to the non management pension plan  an increase in the abo  or a corresponding decrease in plan assets of million or greater as of december   would result in an aml of approximately million  net of tax 
the actuarial expense calculation for the postretirement health plan is based on numerous assumptions  estimates and judgments including health care cost trend rates and cap related cost sharing 
our non management labor contract with the union contains contractual limits on the company funded portion of retiree medical costs referred to as caps 
the company has waived the premiums in excess of the caps during the current and past labor contract periods and  therefore has waived any cost sharing from those non management retirees 
the company has previously accounted for the obligation for non management retiree medical costs based on the terms of the written labor contract with the union 
the company has provided the same benefits for non management and management retirees and therefore  has accounted for the obligation for management retiree medical costs on the same basis as non management retiree medical costs 
the company has determined that its past history of waiving and or increasing caps in labor contract negotiations with the union  coupled with the expectation that the caps will be waived or increased in future contract negotiations  creates a substantive plan that is an uncapped plan and differs from the written plan 
accordingly  effective december   the company has accounted for its retiree medical benefit obligation for non management and management retirees as if there were no caps 
in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of fsp 
fsp provides guidance on accounting for the effects of the new medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of the act by employers whose prescription drug benefits are actuarially equivalent to the drug benefit under medicare part d 
fsp was effective as of the first interim period beginning after june  the company adopted fsp during the third quarter of which reduced postretirement medical expense by million and reduced the postretirement benefit obligation by million in the reduction in postretirement expense for was comprised of a million benefit related to interest cost and a million benefit in the amortization of the actuarial loss

voice revenue  which includes local service  switched access  information services and value added services revenues  of million in decreased  or million  compared to local service revenue declined million as a result of both fewer access lines in service  which declined from  at december  to  at december   and a lower average revenue per line 
the lower average revenue per line is the result of selected price discounts to enterprise customers and certain rate plans related to the service launch in dayton  ohio 
access lines within the segment s ilec territory decreased  or  from  to  the majority of this decrease is a  decrease in primary residential access lines  which the company believes is primary due to customers electing to use wireless communication wireless substitution in lieu of the traditional local service 
in march  the company expanded its product suite in dayton  ohio and began to mass market voice services to residential and small business customers 
this helped to increase clec access lines by  lines during  bringing total access lines outside its ilec service territory to  which is of its total access lines at december  voice revenues also declined million as a result of decreases in trunking revenue and million as a result of decreases in value added services revenue due to price decreases to consumers and small businesses provided within the company s super bundle  custom connections sm

compared to revenue wireless segment revenue increased million  or  to million during compared to equipment revenue increased million in primarily due to a increase in new service activations and of cbw s existing tdma customers purchasing new handsets to switch their service to the its company s new gsm service 
this increase in equipment revenue offset a million decrease in roaming revenue and a million decrease in cbw subscriber service revenue 
cbw s roaming revenue declined primarily as a result of a decrease in average revenue per roaming minute as a greater amount of awe roaming traffic was lower priced gsm minutes than in total roaming revenue equaled million in as a result of the cingular merger  cbw expects to lose substantially all of its roaming revenue in as awe customers begin roaming on cingular s network versus cbw s network

subscriber service revenue declined million as a result of a million postpaid service revenue decrease more than offsetting a million increase in prepaid service revenue 
postpaid revenue decreased as a result of a  decrease in subscribers  driven primarily by an average monthly customer churn which increased to in compared to in  and a decrease in postpaid arpu  excluding roaming revenue  from in to  which is in part the result of customer migrations to lower priced gsm rate plans 
the company believes that the increase in postpaid churn during the year is the result of a combination of factors most notably network quality issues created by cbw s network migration 
the company expects to resolve these quality issues during  thus enabling churn levels to trend back to more historic levels 
at december  cbw had  postpaid subscribers 
prepaid service revenue increases were largely the result of increased subscribers

in the first three quarters of  the company also focused its marketing efforts on prepaid subscribers 
these subscribers require less growth capital on the company s tdma network  which the company attempted to minimize because it curtailed tdma capital expenditures  while it completed construction of its gsm gprs network

except for amounts recorded in relation to insured losses  the company has not recorded a liability for these indemnities  commitments and other guarantees in the consolidated balance sheets  excepted as described below 
the following table summarizes the company s indemnification obligations as of december  dollars in millions fair value estimated maximum indemnities indemnities to the buyer of the broadband assets indemnities related to legal settlement agreements total indemnities the company has indemnified the buyer of the broadband assets against certain potential claims  including environmental  tax  title and authorization 
the title and authorization indemnification was capped at of the purchase price of the broadband assets  which initially was million  subject to reductions under the terms of the purchase agreement 
the environmental indemnities were capped at of the purchase price of the broadband assets 
in order to determine the fair value of the indemnity obligations and warranties provided to the buyer of the broadband assets  the company performed a probability weighted discounted cash flow analysis  utilizing the minimum and maximum potential claims and several scenarios within the range of possibilities 
for the year ended december   the analysis originally resulted in a million estimated fair value of the indemnity obligations  which was included in other liabilities and has been reflected as a reduction of the gain on sale of broadband assets in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss 
during the fourth quarter of  the company decreased the liability related to the indemnity obligations to million due to the expiration of the general representations and warranties and no broker warranties  and recorded million as a gain on sale of broadband assets in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss

cash flow compared to in the company generated cash from operating activities of million  which was million  or  less than in the prior year 
this decrease was primarily attributable to increased handset subsidies for new customer additions and the migration of existing tdma customer to its new gsm gprs network 
the company also experienced higher cash consumption with regard to working capital on behalf of its ongoing businesses and due to payments on accrued liabilities that remained from the sale of substantially all the broadband segment assets 
offsetting these declines  however  was an improvement resulting from the sale of the broadband business in june  which was operating at a cash deficit prior to the sale of the company s broadband assets 
the company s investing activities included outflows for capital expenditures and inflows from the sale of certain assets 
capital expenditures during totaled million  million higher than the million incurred in in  the company received million from the sale of certain assets of its broadband business and million from the sale of its entire equity investment in terabeam  offset by million in fees related to the sale of the brcom assets

this is million less than during  when the company reduced borrowings under its credit facility with the net proceeds of million from the senior subordinated notes  million from the senior notes due  million from the notes and approximately million of the proceeds from the sale of the broadband business 
the company incurred no debt issuance costs during  in comparison to the million incurred during as a result of the aforementioned capital structure transactions 
the company also paid approximately million and million in preferred stock dividends during years ended december  and  respectively 
primarily as a net result of the transactions noted above  the company used million of its cash flows for financing activities during  which was million less than during as of december   the company held million in cash and cash equivalents 
the company s primary sources of cash will be cash generated by operations and borrowings from the company s revolving credit facility 
the primary uses of cash will be for funding the maintenance and strategic expansion of the local and wireless networks  interest and principal payments on the company s credit facilities  notes  senior notes due  senior notes due  notes due  notes  and cbt notes  dividends on the cumulative convertible preferred stock  working capital  and the extinguishment of the remaining liabilities of the company s broadband segment 
compared to for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities totaled million  million more than the million provided by operating activities during the year ended december  this increase was largely due to a reduction in cash used in operations and working capital needs resulting from the sale of substantially all of the broadband assets 
the company s investing activities included outflows for capital expenditures and inflows from the sale of equity investments and assets 
capital expenditures during totaled million  million lower than the million incurred during the decrease was due to completion of the optical overbuild of the national broadband network and subsequent sale of the broadband assets  partially offset by an increase at cbw related to the gsm gprs network overbuild previously discussed 
in  the company received million from the sale of substantially all of the assets of its broadband business and million from the sale of its entire equity investment in terabeam  offset by million in fees related to the sale of the brcom assets 
in  the company received proceeds of million as a result of the sale of substantially all of the assets of cbd and million from the sale of its entire equity stake in anthem inc the company received  million of gross cash proceeds from the issuance of the notes  the senior notes due and the notes during these gross proceeds were used to pay amounts outstanding under the credit facility  purchase the convertible subordinated notes at a discounted price equal to of their accreted value  and pay fees and expenses related to the transactions 
the company permanently prepaid million in borrowings under its term and revolving credit facilities and made a million payment under its term credit facilities with the net cash proceeds from the notes  the net cash proceeds from the senior notes due and cash provided by operations 
bcsi inc  a subsidiary of brcom  permanently repaid million of the revolving credit facility using cash proceeds of million from the sale of broadband assets and borrowings from the company to fund operations and pay down remaining liabilities of million in the company reduced its borrowings under its revolving credit facilities utilizing cash provided by operations and cash on its balance sheet as of december  approximately million in cumulative convertible preferred stock dividends were paid during as a result of brcom s decision to defer the february   may  and august  cash dividend payment on its preferreds  the company conserved approximately million in cash during compared to the dividends were accrued  and therefore were presented as minority interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss through the exchange of the preferred stock on september  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of minority interest 
debt issuance costs during totaled million  million higher than the million incurred during the increase in debt issuance costs is due to the financing transactions completed in regulatory matters and competitive trends federal the telecommunications act of was enacted with the goal of establishing a pro competitive  deregulatory framework to promote competition and investment in advanced telecommunications facilities and services to all americans 
since federal regulators have considered a multitude of proceedings ostensibly aimed at fulfilling the goals of the act and this process is continuing through numerous proceedings currently before the federal communications commission fcc and the federal courts 
although the act called for a deregulatory framework  the fcc s approach has been to maintain significant regulatory restraints on the traditional incumbent local exchange carriers while opening up opportunities for new competitive entrants and services with minimal regulation 
while cincinnati bell has expanded beyond its incumbent local exchange operations by offering wireless  long distance  broadband service  internet access and out of territory competitive local exchange services  the majority of its revenue is still derived from its traditional local exchange services 
the financial impact of the various federal proceedings will depend on many factors including the extent of competition in our market and the timing and outcome of the fcc s decisions and any appeals from those decisions 
intercarrier compensation current rules specify different means of compensating carriers for the use of their networks depending on the type of traffic and technology used by the carriers 
the fcc has just recently opened a proceeding to consider various plans that have been proposed for revising the disparate intercarrier compensation system into a unified regime that treats all traffic in a uniform manner 
the outcome of this proceeding could have significant impacts on all carriers and will probably be phased in over a five to ten year period 
this proceeding impacts the switched access and end user components of cbt s revenue 
reciprocal compensation although the topic of reciprocal compensation will ultimately be addressed within the broader intercarrier compensation proceeding mentioned above  the fcc adopted an order which in the short term directly impacted the rules for the termination of isp bound dial up traffic 
the previous rules capped the total number of minutes that could be compensated growth cap and limited compensation to markets in which the carriers previously exchanged traffic new markets rule 
the fcc s new order eliminated the growth cap and the new markets rule 
this decision could increase the amount that cbt must pay to clecs with which it exchanges such traffic 
however  several carriers have sought reconsideration of the decision by the fcc and other carriers have filed appeals with the federal court 
voip during the fcc declared that voip services are interstate services 
in addition  the fcc has considered several petitions asking it to rule on whether and under what circumstances voice services utilizing internet protocol ip are subject to access charges 
it has ruled that peer to peer internet voice services that do not use the public switched telephone network pstn are not subject to access charges 
separately  it has ruled that services that originate and terminate on the pstn but employ ip in the middle are subject to access charges 
the fcc is still considering other voip petitions  including one that seeks to exempt from access charges calls that originate using voip  but terminate on the pstn 
in addition  the fcc is considering a broader rulemaking proceeding to determine the regulatory status of ip enabled services generally 
special access in early the fcc opened a proceeding to review the current special access pricing rules 
under the existing rules  cbt s special access services are subject to price cap regulation with no earnings cap 
the new proceeding is examining the entire special access pricing structure  including whether or not to reinstate an earnings cap 
universal service the federal universal service fund is currently funded via an assessment on all telecommunications carriers interstate end user revenue 
the fcc is currently considering alternatives to this method of funding 
some of the alternatives being considered are assessments based on connections and telephone numbers 
any such alteration could result in a change in the manner in which carriers recover their contributions from end users 
unbundled network elements in early the fcc made yet another attempt to rewrite its unbundled network element rules in response to the federal court s remand of the previous rules 
the latest rules have no significant impact on cbt 
however  the elimination of unbundled circuit switching  and thus the une platform une p  will require cbet to migrate its une p lines to alternative arrangements by march  and or to negotiate with the underlying ilec for continued provision of une p 
this is not expected to have a significant adverse impact on cbet since cbet had already planned to migrate the majority of its customers to its own switching facilities 
state because cbt generates the majority of its revenue from the operation of its public switched telephone network  its financial results follow no particular seasonal pattern 
cbt does derive a significant portion of its revenue from pricing plans that are subject to regulatory overview and approval 
in both ohio and kentucky  cbt operates under alternative regulation plans in which cbt cannot increase the price of basic local services and is subject to restrictions on its ability to increase the price of other related services 
in return  cbt is not subject to an earnings cap or recapture in ohio  as it would if regulated under a traditional regulatory plan based upon a targeted rate of return 
cbt has operated under alternative regulation plans since during which price increases and enhanced flexibility for a limited number of services have partially offset the effect of fixed pricing for basic local service and reduced pricing for other  primarily wholesale services 
in june  cbt adopted a new alternative regulation plan in ohio which  although similar to its previous plan  gives cbt the option to remain in the alternative regulation plan indefinitely 
also  cbt s new plan requires the local segment to operate as a competitive local exchange carrier clec in service areas outside of cbt s traditional ilec franchise area 
for approximately the past six years  cbt has offered local services  primarily on its own facilities based network  to ohio communities contiguous to its ilec territory 
in dayton  the local segment has provided its voice services offering using the port loop transport combination une p as well as the une l regulatory format 
on february   the fcc released its unbundled network elements order on remand which will effectively abolish une p as a regulated service and has left each carrier to negotiate new pricing arrangements under commercial agreements 
the local segment has engaged in such negotiations  however  it does not expect the profitability of its dayton local operations to change substantially because the segment had planned to migrate the provisioning of service to une l  which is a more economic service delivery model as the segment has gained customers 
recently issued accounting standards on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be valued at fair value on the date of grant  and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period 
pro forma disclosure of the income statement effects of share based payments is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r is effective for all stock based awards granted on or after july  in addition  companies must also recognize compensation expense related to any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk management the company s objective in managing its exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings  cash flows  fair market value of certain assets and liabilities and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate fluctuations 
to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations  the company uses a combination of variable rate short term and fixed rate long term financial instruments 
because the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate fluctuations  primarily in the form of variable rate borrowings from its credit facility and changes in current rates compared to that of its fixed rate debt  the company sometimes employs derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to these fluctuations and its total interest expense over time 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes or enter into transactions for speculative purposes 
interest rate swap agreements  a particular type of derivative financial instrument  involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between the company and its counterparties in the transactions and do not represent an actual exchange of the notional amounts between the parties 
because the notional amounts are not exchanged  the notional amounts of these agreements are not indicative of the company s exposure resulting from these derivatives 
the amounts to be exchanged between the parties are primarily the net result of the fixed and floating rate percentages to be charged on the swap s notional amount 
in june  the company entered into a series of interest rate swaps with total notional amounts of million that qualify for fair value hedge accounting and expire in january the interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges of a portion of the senior subordinated notes due fair value hedges are hedges that eliminate the risk of changes in the fair value of underlying assets and liabilities 
the interest rate swaps are recorded at their fair value and the carrying value of the senior subordinated notes due is adjusted by the same corresponding value in accordance with the shortcut method of statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
as of december   the fair value of interest rate swap contracts was million 
pursuant to a series of transactions in late february and early march  the company executed additional fixed to floating interest rate swaps with notional amounts of million in order to a hedge the fair value risk associated with additional fixed coupon debt and b re balance the fixed to floating rate mix with regard to the company s capital structure 
on february   as part of the refinancing plan  the company concurrently sold million aggregate principal amount of new senior notes due and an additional million aggregate principal amount of the company s previously issued notes due collectively  the new bonds 
the net proceeds from the offering of the new bonds  together with amounts under the company s new credit facility  were used to repay all outstanding borrowings of million and terminate the company s prior credit facility 
the new bonds are fixed rate bonds to maturity and are not callable until february  and january   respectively 
the interest rate swaps essentially change the fixed rate nature of the new bonds to mimic the floating rates paid on the prior credit facility 
the desired effect of the interest rate swaps are to largely offset the increase in interest expense resulting from the issuance of the new bonds in the short term  but are subject to  and will be affected by  future changes in interest rates 
potential nonperformance by counterparties to the swap agreements exposes the company to a certain amount of credit risk due to the possibility of counterparty default 
because the company s only counterparties in these transactions are financial institutions that are at least investment grade  it believes the risk of counterparty default is minimal 
the company also seeks to minimize risk associated with a concentration of credit risk by placing these interest rate swaps with a variety of investment grade financial institutions 
the following table sets forth the face amounts  maturity dates and average interest rates for the fixed and floating rate debt held by the company at december  excluding capital leases and unamortized discount dollars in millions thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt average interest rate on fixed rate debt floating rate debt average interest rate on floating rate debt
