item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a non operating holding company whose income is derived from the earnings of our five wholly owned subsidiaries 
we are engaged primarily in the collection  storage  treatment and distribution of potable water for domestic  industrial  commercial and fire protection service in southern and central new hampshire through our three utility subsidiaries pennichuck  pennichuck east and pittsfield 
our water utility revenues constituted of our consolidated revenues in pennichuck  our principal subsidiary which was established in  accounted for of our consolidated revenues 
pennichuck s core franchise area presently includes the city of nashua  new hampshire and surrounding municipalities 
our water subsidiaries are regulated by the new hampshire public utilities commission new hampshire puc and must obtain new hampshire puc approval to increase their water rates to recover increases in operating expenses and to obtain the opportunity to earn a return on investments in plant and equipment 
new hampshire law provides that utilities are entitled to charge rates which permit them to earn a reasonable return on the cost of the property employed in serving its customers  less accrued depreciation  contributed capital and deferred income taxes rate base 
the cost of capital permanently employed by a utility in its utility business marks the minimum rate of return which a utility is lawfully entitled to earn on its rate base 
capital expenditures associated with complying with federal and state water quality standards have historically been recognized and approved by the new hampshire puc for inclusion in our water rates  though there can be no assurance that the new hampshire puc will approve future rate increases in a timely or sufficient manner to cover our capital expenditures 
the businesses of our two other subsidiaries are non regulated water management services and real estate development and investment 
service corporation provides various non regulated water related monitoring  maintenance  testing and compliance reporting services for water systems for various towns  businesses and residential communities in and around southern and central new hampshire 
its most significant contracts are with the town of hudson  new hampshire and the town of salisbury  massachusetts 
southwood is actively engaged in real estate planning  development and management of residential  commercial  industrial and retail properties 
historically  most of southwood s activities were conducted through real estate joint ventures 
during the past years southwood has participated in four residential joint ventures with john p 
stabile ii  a local developer 
southwood s earnings have from time to time during that period contributed a significant percentage of our consolidated net income 
southwood s contributions from the sale of real estate have increased the fluctuations in our net income during that period 
we expect that southwood will contribute a smaller proportion of our future revenues and earnings

events significantly affecting our earnings during recent years overview 
our earnings during the five year period ended december  were significantly affected by the following events that occurred during one or more years of that period sales of land by southwood  which were especially significant in   and  expenses related to the merger agreement that we entered into in april with aqua america inc formerly known as philadelphia suburban corporation and terminated in february  our actions to oppose ongoing efforts by the city of nashua  new hampshire that began in to acquire all or a significant portion of pennichuck s assets through an eminent domain proceeding under new hampshire utility law  and defense and settlement costs related to parallel investigations by the us securities and exchange commission the sec and the new hampshire bureau of securities regulation the bureau that began in late and early and settled in december southwood real estate related revenues 
our revenues and earnings were positively affected by significant sales of southwood land during four of the past five years 
the following table sets forth the amount of revenues that we recognized during each year in the to period attributable to those land sales and the percentage that those revenues represented of our total revenues during each of those years 
year southwood land sales of consolidated revenues we expect that the overall trend shown in the preceding table will continue  and southwood s revenues from land sales will constitute a decreasing percentage of our consolidated revenues 
terminated merger agreement 
we entered into an agreement in april to be acquired in a merger with aqua america inc our shareholders would have received aqua america shares having a value of per 
table of contents share at the time we announced the agreement 
in february  before the merger was submitted to our shareholders  we agreed with aqua america to abandon the proposed transaction  because of actions taken by the city of nashua  summarized below  to attempt to acquire all or a significant portion of pennichuck s assets by eminent domain 
we incurred million and  of merger related expenses that we recognized in and  respectively 
city of nashua s ongoing eminent domain proceeding 
the city of nashua s mayor stated his opposition to our proposed merger with aqua america almost immediately after we announced it 
in january  nashua residents approved a referendum authorizing the city to pursue the acquisition of our assets by eminent domain or otherwise 
in march  as part of the eminent domain process  the city filed a petition with the new hampshire puc seeking approval to acquire all of our water utility assets  whether or not related to our nashua service area 
the eminent domain proceeding and potential consequences for us are described elsewhere in this prospectus 
see item we have vigorously opposed the efforts of the city to acquire our assets by eminent domain and intend to continue to do so 
the new hampshire puc has not set a schedule for the eminent domain proceeding  and we do not expect the new hampshire puc to rule on the matter before late our eminent domain related expenses in and were  and million  respectively 
we expect our eminent domain expenses in to be comparable to those expenses incurred in sec and new hampshire investigations and settlement 
we and our former president and chief executive officer  who resigned in april  were the subject of parallel investigations by the sec and the bureau that began in early and late  respectively 
as disclosed elsewhere in this prospectus  the sec and the bureau alleged that some of our public disclosures regarding various joint venture transactions in the mid to late s were materially false or misleading in several respects  and the bureau contended that we exercised insufficient oversight of southwood s joint ventures  allegedly evidenced by our failing to obtain or to keep adequate records  failing to obtain formal appraisals of the land we contributed to the joint ventures  and failing to consider or investigate real estate development alternatives since the early s 
see item effective december   the sec and the bureau entered into settlements with the former president and us 
the former president paid the state of new hampshire an administrative fine of  and investigation costs of  in addition  under the terms of the new hampshire settlement our shareholders as of march  received a payment totaling  as of march  the former president was financially responsible for  of that amount and we were responsible for the balance 
our investigation related expenses in and were  and  respectively 
recent developments settlement of pennichuck rate relief 
in march  we reached a settlement with the new hampshire puc staff on our requested rate relief for pennichuck that we filed in may a hearing on the settlement is scheduled for april  and we expect that the new hampshire puc will issue a final written decision shortly thereafter 
in september  the new hampshire puc authorized an interim annualized increase of million effective retroactively for service rendered on and after june  the settlement agreement  if approved by the new hampshire puc  will result in a final annualized rate increase of million  also effective as of june  there can be no assurance that the rate relief will be granted 
new bank revolving credit facility 
effective march   we restructured and expanded our debt arrangements with bank of america  increasing our revolving credit facility to million from million 
the bank of america facility permits us to borrow  repay and re borrow  in varying amounts and from time to time at our discretion through december   subject to the terms and conditions of the facility 
the new arrangement replaced one that was scheduled to expire in april 
table of contents long term debt 
in january  we issued million of long term  fixed rate tax exempt debt  with million representing new funds and the balance utilized to optionally redeem a like amount of higher cost tax exempt debt 
in march  we issued million of year taxable debt to an insurance company pursuant to a private placement transaction 
a portion of the proceeds million represented new funds and the balance million was utilized to fund the maturity of a like amount of higher cost taxable debt 
in late march we received a commitment from bank of america  the lender for an existing million loan to the company and pennichuck east  as co borrowers  due april   to extend the loan to a new maturity date on or before december  the extension commitment contains covenants substantially similar to the company s new revolving credit facility as described above 
the company s board of directors is expected to approve the transaction subject to new hampshire puc approval 
we have filed a petition with the new hampshire puc seeking approval of the extension and a related swap transaction to convert the loan to a fixed interest rate on or before april  pending acquisition 
in january  we entered into an agreement to acquire three water systems with approximately  total customers in the lakes region and central part of new hampshire the locke lake water system in barnstead  the birch hill water system in conway and the sunrise estates water system in middleton  new hampshire 
the acquisition  which is our largest since  is subject to completion of our due diligence and the approval of the new hampshire puc 
we expect the acquisition to close by the end of critical accounting policies we have identified the accounting policies below as those policies critical to our business operations and the understanding of the results of operations 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in significant changes to the financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are as follows 
regulatory accounting 
the use of regulatory assets and liabilities as permitted by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation stipulates generally accepted accounting principles for companies whose rates are established by or are subject to approval by an independent third party regulator such as the new hampshire puc 
in accordance with sfas  we defer costs and credits on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that these costs and credits will be recognized in the rate making process in a period different from when the costs and credits were incurred 
these deferred amounts  both assets and liabilities  are then recognized in the income statement in the same period that they are reflected in rates charged to our water utilities customers 
in the event that the inclusion in the rate making process is disallowed  the associated regulatory asset or liability would be adjusted to reflect the change in our assessment or change in regulatory approval 
we did not defer the costs associated with the terminated merger agreement with aqua america  the city of nashua s ongoing eminent domain proceeding or the sec and bureau regulatory investigations and settlements 
revenue recognition 
the revenues of our water utility subsidiaries are based on authorized rates approved by the new hampshire puc 
estimates of water utility revenues for water delivered to customers but not yet billed are accrued at the end of each accounting period 
we read our residential customer meters generally on a quarterly basis and record revenues based on meter reading results 
unbilled revenues from the last meter reading date to the end of the accounting period are estimated based on historical usage patterns and the effective water rates 
the estimate of the unbilled revenue is a management estimate utilizing certain sets of assumptions and conditions 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
accrued unbilled revenues recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december  and were approximately million and million  respectively 

table of contents our non utility revenues are recognized when services are rendered or when water is delivered 
revenues are based  for the most part  on long term contractual rates 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
our pension and other postretirement benefits costs are dependent upon several factors and assumptions  such as employee demographics  plan design  the level of cash contributions made to the plans  earnings on the plans assets  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on the plans assets and health care cost trends 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas  changes in pension and postretirement benefit obligations other than pensions pbop associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension and pbop costs in the statements of income  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of the plans participants 
as further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  we revised the discount rate in to from in to reflect market conditions 
in determining pension obligation and cost amounts  this and other assumptions may change from period to period  and such changes could result in material changes to recorded pension and pbop costs and funding requirements 
further  the value of our pension plan assets  which partially consist of equity investments  were adversely affected by significant declines in the financial markets from through  which more than offset positive investment performance during and fluctuations in market returns may result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods 
these conditions impacted the funded status of our pension plan at both december  and  and therefore  will also impact pension costs for our pension plan currently meets the minimum funding requirements of the employee retirement income security act of although we are not required to make contributions to the plan  we anticipate that we will contribute approximately  to the plan in results of operations general in this section  we discuss our  and results of operations and the factors affecting them 
our operating activities  as discussed in greater detail in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  are grouped into three primary business segments as follows water utility operations  water management services  and real estate development and investment 
our consolidated revenues tend to be significantly affected by weather conditions experienced throughout the year and by sales of major real estate parcels which may occur from time to time 
water revenues are typically at their lowest point during the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year 
water revenues in the second and third quarters tend to be greater because of increased water consumption for non essential usage by our customers during the late spring and summer months 
results of operations compared to overview 
for the year ended december   our consolidated net income was million  compared to net income of million in  an increase of approximately 
on a per share basis  basic income per 
table of contents share was 
for the twelve months ended december  as compared to 
per share for the year ended december  the increase in consolidated net income was primarily attributable to a temporary rate increase approved by the new hampshire puc of implemented by pennichuck for service rendered on and after june   a permanent rate increase of approved by the new hampshire puc and implemented by pittsfield in february  and a increase in the combined utility customer base for the year 
these factors contributed to a increase in revenues to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  our costs related to defending against the city of nashua s eminent domain proceeding increased significantly in  which more than offset a decline in the costs related to the sec and bureau investigations 
our eminent domain related expenses were million in compared to  in our investigation related expenses in were  compared to  in excluding the effect of the eminent domain and investigation related expenses  our consolidated net income was million  or per share  in and million  or 
per share  in we believe that a presentation of net income excluding these expenses is useful to investors because it is indicative of our financial performance in the ordinary course of business 
we use net income excluding these expenses to evaluate our financial performance because we expect that the financial impact of these expenses has become or  in the relatively near term  will become insignificant 
expenses related to the terminated merger agreement with aqua america and the settlement with the sec and the bureau will not have a material financial impact on us in and beyond 
we expect that the financial impact of expenses related to the eminent domain proceeding will cease within the next two to three years 
the material limitation associated with using this measure is that it does not include all of the expenses required to be included by generally accepted accounting principles 
we compensate for this limitation when using this measure by comparing it directly to net income calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles 
water utility operations 
our water utility operations include the activities of pennichuck  pennichuck east and pittsfield  each of which is regulated by the new hampshire puc 
on a combined basis  net income of our three utilities in calendar year was approximately million  an increase of  from principally due to the rate relief received by two of the utility subsidiaries from the new hampshire puc in as well as modest growth in our utility customer base as discussed below 
our utility operating revenues increased to million in  or almost from for  approximately  and of our total utility operating revenues were generated by pennichuck  pennichuck east and pittsfield  respectively  as shown in the following table 
change pennichuck pennichuck east pittsfield total the overall increase in water revenues reflects the rate relief granted to pennichuck and pittsfield during as well as a increase in the combined utility customer base during the year  resulting in a total combined customer base of approximately  as of december  overall billed consumption of our 
table of contents three utilities was relatively flat during the period 
total billed consumption in pennichuck s core system as well as within our pittsfield system was slightly lower than consumption levels during total billed consumption in pennichuck east was approximately greater than total rainfall during was nearly inches compared to almost inches of rain during this decrease in rainfall contributed to the increased consumption in pennichuck east  which traditionally experiences higher revenues attributable to irrigation activities during the summer months 
in may  pittsfield filed a notice of intent to file for rate relief in which it sought an increase in its annual revenues 
that rate case was concluded in december  and in january the new hampshire puc granted an increase of  representing additional annual revenues of approximately  this rate relief is effective for water bills rendered on and after january  the positive effect of this rate relief was partially offset by lower consumption due to a wetter than normal summer 
on may   pennichuck filed a petition for rate relief with the new hampshire puc in which it is seeking an overall increase in its rates  which if granted  would have resulted in approximately million of additional annual revenues 
on september   the new hampshire puc granted pennichuck temporary rate relief of effective for service rendered on or after june  this temporary rate relief represents approximately million in annual water revenues and such increase will be adjusted when permanent rates are set by order of the new hampshire puc 
in march  we reached a settlement with the new hampshire puc staff on our requested rate relief for pennichuck that we filed in may a hearing on the settlement is scheduled for april  and we expect that the new hampshire puc will issue a final written decision shortly thereafter 
the settlement agreement  if approved by the new hampshire puc  will result in a final annualized rate relief of million  effective retroactively for service rendered on and after june  for the year ended december   utility operating expenses increased by  or  to million as shown in the table below 
change operations maintenance depreciation amortization taxes other than income taxes total the operations and maintenance expenses of our water utility business include such categories as water supply  treatment  purification and pumping  transmission and distribution system functions  including repairs and maintenance and meter reading  and customer service and general and administrative functions 
the combined increase in our utilities operating expenses over was chiefly the result of the following approximately  of increased purification and treatment costs in our core pennichuck system  reflecting higher purchased water  power  chemical and labor costs   of increased general and administrative costs primarily relating to costs for employee benefits  property and casualty insurance and administrative salaries  recognition of approximately  in additional depreciation and amortization charges resulting from approximately million of new capital investment over the past three years  and a  decrease in local and state property taxes as a result of a  tax abatement recorded in the fourth quarter of from the state of new hampshire that more than offset the impact of additional taxable assets placed in service within the utilities franchise areas during 
table of contents these increased costs are expected to be embedded in our utilities future cost of providing water service 
as such  our utilities will continue to seek future rate relief to recover these increasing costs

the following table provides a breakdown of revenues from our non regulated  water related water management services operations for the years ended december  and change municipal contracts community system contracts watertight program miscellaneous total the  increase in contract revenues from municipal contracts primarily resulted from additional contract fees billed by service corporation for unplanned work performed under those contracts

the  or  decline in expenses from to resulted principally from a decrease of  in allocated intercompany charges due to a change in the methodology that we used to allocate to service corporation the cost of the resources provided by the company and pennichuck 
the decrease in the intercompany charge more than offset an increase in direct expenses of  real estate development and investment 
for the year ended december   southwood s revenues were million compared to  in in the table below  we show the major components of southwood s revenues during and land sales folsom property westwood park llc other income from unconsolidated equity investments total 
table of contents the increase in our real estate revenues resulted principally from the sale of an approximately acre parcel of unimproved land located in merrimack  new hampshire 
in january  southwood sold this land to the folsom development corporation for approximately million 
under the terms of that sale  southwood received approximately  in cash and a long term note receivable of million 
the note  which was set to mature in october  carried a floating interest rate of prime plus and was secured by a first mortgage on the property 
the note was fully paid during the fourth quarter of  resulting in recognition of the remaining gain of million in accordance with the requirements established under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
at december  and  southwood had a ownership interest in four joint ventures organized as limited liability companies  as discussed in greater detail under off balance sheet arrangements and also under note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the remaining ownership interest in each joint venture is held by john p 
stabile ii  a local developer  with whom southwood has also participated in four residential joint ventures during the past years 
southwood uses the equity method of accounting for its investments in the joint ventures 
consequently  southwood s investment is adjusted for its share of earnings or losses and for any distributions received from the joint venture 
for the year ended december   southwood s share of pre tax earnings and distributions from these joint ventures was approximately  and  respectively  compared to pre tax earnings of  and distributions of  for the decline in the joint ventures pre tax earnings resulted primarily from several tenant vacancies in the hecop i and hecop iii buildings

during  westwood received  representing escrowed funds from a land sale which occurred in expenses associated with our real estate operations were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively

we expect that during each of the next several years southwood will incur approximately million of expenses for development efforts  salaries and other administrative costs 
eminent domain related expenses 
our costs incurred in defending against the city of nashua s eminent domain proceeding increased significantly in to million from  the increase was primarily attributable to expenses incurred in a significant public relations campaign opposing the city s efforts and to costs incurred in litigating several cases with the city in state and federal courts

for the period to  the majority of our funds were provided through a combination of cash flow from utility operations and sales of portions of our real estate holdings 
we supplemented these sources of funds beginning in the fourth quarter of and throughout by drawing down a portion of the funds available under our bank revolving credit facility 
in addition  we also generated approximately  during the period to through the issuance of new shares of common stock under our dividend reinvestment plan 

table of contents to capital expenditures program 
we expect our capital expenditures to increase substantially during the to period  as discussed elsewhere in this prospectus 
see risk factors and our business 
the following table summarizes our capital expenditures and other funds requirements for the to period 
utility plant additions other total utility plant additions other total our water utilities are capital intensive businesses 
we are engaged in continuous construction programs at our utility subsidiaries primarily for water distribution system repair  rehabilitation and replacement  water storage facility maintenance and additions  and more recently  water supply security 
for the period to  capital expenditures for water distribution  storage  and supply totaled million  or approximately million per year 
for and the period to  comparable expenditures are expected to total million and million in current dollars  respectively  or approximately million per year 
in addition to our recurring programs  we are embarking on two major new construction initiatives 
the first is an upgrade of our water treatment plant that is necessary in order for the plant to meet more stringent  federally mandated safe drinking water standards 
the water treatment plant project will commence in the second half of and is expected to be completed during capital expenditures associated with the water treatment plant upgrade project are expected to total approximately million for and million for to the second is the installation of a radio meter reading rmr system 
the rmr system will enable a switch from quarterly to monthly billing and will facilitate the introduction of conservation based pricing during periods of extremely heavy consumption the summer months 
we will pilot the rmr system in  residential customer premises in with a full system roll out  based upon the success of the pilot  scheduled for and capital expenditures for the rmr system are expected to be  in and million for to in addition to the upgrade of our water treatment plant and the installation of the rmr system  we expect to incur other capital expenditures aggregating million in and million for to these other expenditures include  in part  potential acquisition of small regional regulated water utility systems  consistent with our record of prior acquisitions  and potential real estate related acquisitions by southwood 
external financing requirements 
due to the significant increases in our utility construction program commencing in and as described above  we expect that only to of our funding requirements will be provided by cash flow from our operations after payment of dividends on common stock 
we expect that the balance of our funding will be obtained through long term debt arrangements and the issuance of common stock 
our timing and mix of future debt and equity financing is subject to a number of factors including  but not limited to i debt and equity market conditions  ii the need to maintain a balanced capital structure in order to preserve financial flexibility and to manage the overall cost of capital  and iii certain debt issuance covenants as contained in our outstanding loan agreements 
there is no assurance that we will be able to complete all or any of the future debt and equity financings described below or to complete them on a timely basis 

table of contents the receipt of timely and adequate rate relief will also be critically important in providing us cash flow from operations and the ability to access credit and permanent capital  both debt and equity  at reasonable costs and terms 
we are unable  however  to predict the outcome of our future rate relief filings 
recent and contemplated long term debt arrangements 
in january  we issued million of long term  fixed rate tax exempt debt  with million representing new funds and the balance utilized to optionally redeem a like amount of higher cost tax exempt debt 
in march  we issued million of year taxable debt to an insurance company pursuant to a private placement transaction 
a portion of the proceeds million represented new funds and the balance million was utilized to fund the maturity of a like amount of higher cost taxable debt 
effective march   we restructured and expanded our debt arrangements with bank of america  increasing our revolving credit facility to million from million 
the bank of america facility permits us to borrow  repay and re borrow  in varying amounts and from time to time at our discretion through december   subject to the terms and conditions of the facility 
the new arrangement replaced one that was scheduled to expire in april in late march we received a commitment from bank of america  the lender for an existing million loan to the company and pennichuck east  as co borrowers  due april   to extend the loan to a new maturity date on or before december  the extension commitment contains covenants substantially similar to the company s new revolving credit facility as described above 
the company s board of directors is expected to approve the transaction subject to new hampshire puc approval 
we have filed a petition with the new hampshire puc seeking approval of the extension and a related swap transaction to convert the loan to a fixed interest rate on or before april  we also have access  from time to time  to low cost long term debt from two sources 
first  we have applied and will continue to apply for long term debt funds directly from the state of new hampshire under the state s revolving fund program srf 
funds provided under the srf loans carry long term fixed costs at interest rates set with reference to various municipal bond indices  which rates are generally below the rates for comparable us treasury securities of like maturity 
as of march   we had three outstanding srf loans aggregating approximately  in the first quarter of  we received a preliminary commitment from the state for a new srf loan in the amount of  the new srf loan is expected to close at or around mid year our other source of low cost  long term debt is tax exempt debt issued on our behalf by the new hampshire bond finance authority bfa 
the bfa acts solely as a passive conduit to the tax exempt bond markets with us acting as the obligor for the associated tax exempt debt 
at march  we had six outstanding bfa or its predecessor entity issues aggregating million 
to tax exempt bond financing plan 
we intend to raise approximately million in one or more bfa debt financings in through the bfa recently gave preliminary approval for the financing 
the proposed amount would cover substantially all of our capital expenditures for through approximately million of a total of million  including our water treatment plant upgrade project  various water distribution  storage  supply maintenance  rehabilitation and replacement projects and the proposed rmr system 
such financing requires certain approvals including  but not limited to  an allocation of a portion of the state s annual volume cap for certain types of tax exempt bond offerings including offerings of the type we are contemplating 
there is no assurance that we will be able to complete the contemplated bfa financings on a timely basis or at all 
significant financial covenants 
our new revolving credit facility contains three financial maintenance tests which must be met on a quarterly basis 
these maintenance tests are as follows our fixed charge coverage ratio must exceed x  
table of contents our tangible net worth must exceed million plus new equity proceeds  and our funded debt must not exceed of our total capitalization 
also  various pennichuck and pennichuck east loan agreements contain tests that govern the issuance of additional indebtedness 
these issuance tests are as follows to issue short term debt  our total debt must not exceed of our total capital unless the new short term debt is subordinated to existing debt  to issue long term debt  our funded debt must not exceed of our property additions  and to issue long term debt  our earnings available for interest divided by our interest expense must exceed x 
under pennichuck s most restrictive covenant  approximately million of its retained earnings was unrestricted for payment or declaration of common dividends to the company at december  as of march   we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants 
contemplated equity offering 
we are planning to conduct a public offering of our common stock during the second quarter of pursuant to a registration statement that we expect to file with the sec on or about march  we anticipate that the net proceeds to us from that offering will be approximately million to million 
we intend to use the net proceeds primarily to fund utility capital additions and for other general corporate purposes 
pending such use  we plan to repay indebtedness under our revolving credit facility with bank of america 
there can be no assurance that the offering will be completed in or at any later time 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  southwood had a ownership interest in four joint ventures organized as limited liability companies 
the remaining ownership interest in each of the joint ventures is held by john p 
stabile ii  a local developer with whom southwood has also participated in four other residential joint ventures during the past ten years 
the formation of these joint ventures provides southwood with an opportunity to develop its landholdings in such a manner as to provide for a long term income stream through commercial rental activities 
additionally  the joint ventures  as legal entities  mitigate the financial risk associated with sole ownership of developed commercial properties by southwood 
the joint ventures  whose assets and liabilities are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  own certain commercial office buildings on which there are outstanding mortgage notes totaling million and million as of december  and  respectively 
distributions from the joint ventures have from time to time during the past ten years been a significant source of funds to support our dividend payments to shareholders 
we account for southwood s investment in the four current joint ventures using the equity method of accounting  meaning that we recognize on a current basis of each joint venture s operating results 
those results reflect ongoing carrying costs such as maintenance and property taxes 
information about our revenues  expenses and cash flows arising from the joint ventures is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations as of december   and the periods in which payments are due  adjusted for the implementation of our expanded and restructured credit facility with bank of america described above total less than year to years to years after years long term debt capital leases operating leases pension and post retirement contributions purchase obligations total includes million of debt that had been due within less than one year as of december   which had either been refinanced with long term debt or was the subjet of firm commitments to refinance with long term debt 
pension and post retirement contributions cannot be reasonably estimated beyond and may be impacted by such factors as return on pension assets  changes in the number of plan participants and future salary increases 
pennichuck has a wholesale water agreement the agreement with manchester nh water works mww to purchase water from mww through six metering points for various community water systems owned by pennichuck and pennichuck east 
the agreement  amended in february  has a year term and provides for an average daily flow to pennichuck and pennichuck east of up to million gallons per day mgd with a maximum daily flow rate of mgd 
pennichuck and pennichuck east purchase water at a rate established by mww for all of its non manchester customers 
the current rate  effective january   is per one hundred cubic feet ccf in areas where fire protection is not provided by mww and per ccf where fire protection is provided 
the agreement requires that pennichuck and pennichuck east pay a one time source development charge sdc of for each gallon of the million gallons of the average daily flow 
to date  pennichuck and pennichuck east had achieved a combined peak average daily flow of  gallons 
the sdc is re calculated annually to reflect any increases in average daily flow and  if the flow is increased  pennichuck and pennichuck east pay the sdc for the incremental demand 
any incremental sdc is payable in january of each year 
sdc payments began in and as of december   the total sdc paid to mww was  which allows the company to draw an average daily flow of up to  the incremental sdc paid in and was  and  respectively 
there was no sdc due in january since the average daily flow in was less than the previous high average usage level established in any future payments to mww would be subject to an increase in average daily flow 
no future obligations under this contract are disclosed since such future payments are based on future water consumption levels that are affected by weather conditions and customer growth 
in april  pennichuck entered into a long term lease arrangement with hecop iii  llc for approximately  square feet of office space located in merrimack  new hampshire which serves as our headquarters 
southwood holds a ownership interest in hecop iii  llc and the remaining ownership interests are held by john p 
stabile ii  who is also the holder of ownership interests in three other llc joint ventures with southwood as discussed above 
pension plan 
we maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of our employees 
the accounting for this plan under fasb  employer s accounting for pensions  requires that we use key assumptions when computing the estimated annual pension expense 
these assumptions are i the discount rate 
table of contents applied to the projected benefit obligation  ii the long term rate of return on plan assets and iii the long term rate of future increases in compensation 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of our pension obligations and our annual pension expense 
we reduced our discount rate from to for  reflecting the overall change in market conditions 
our expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is based on the plan s expected asset allocation  expected returns on various classes of plan assets as well as historical returns 
we assumed that our long term rate of return on pension plan assets was in and and in in addition  we assumed an increase in participant compensation levels of  and in  and  respectively 
these key assumptions are reviewed annually with our actuary and investment advisor and are updated to reflect the plan s experience 
actual results in any given year will often differ from our actuarial assumptions because of economic and other conditions which may impact the amount of pension expense we recognize 
at december   we had a minimum pension liability of approximately  representing the excess of our pension liabilities over our plan assets 
however  during  the rate of return on plan investments was approximately compared to a negative rate of return of in as a result  the market value of our plan assets was slightly lower than our accumulated benefit obligation by approximately  at december  we recorded an adjustment of approximately  which resulted in a maximum pension liability of approximately  at the end of and a credit  net of taxes  of approximately  to other comprehensive income 
future adjustments to other comprehensive income will be affected by changes in realized returns on pension plan assets  contributions to pension assets by us and changes in discount rates 
dividend reinvestment and common stock purchase plan 
we offer a dividend reinvestment and common stock purchase program that is available to our shareholders and residential utility customers residing in new hampshire 
under this program  our shareholders may reinvest all or a portion of their common dividends into shares of common stock at prevailing market prices 
we also accept optional cash payments to purchase additional shares at of the prevailing market prices 
this program has provided us with additional common equity of  in and  in no additional common equity was provided with respect to this program during environmental matters 
our water utility subsidiaries are subject to the water quality regulations set forth by the epa and the new hampshire department of environmental services des 
the epa is required to periodically set new maximum contaminant levels for certain chemicals as required by the federal safe drinking water act sdwa 
the quality of our treated water currently meets or is better than all standards set by the epa and the des 
however  increased monitoring and reporting standards have led to additional operating costs for us 
any additional monitoring and testing costs arising from future epa and des mandates should eventually be recovered through water rates in our utilities future rate filings 
pennichuck s filtration plant in nashua is impacted by the interim enhanced surface water treatment rule  which established a new turbidity standard of nephelometric turbidity units or ntu 
turbidity is a measure of sediment or foreign particles that are suspended in the water 
pennichuck has committed approximately million in its capital budget to complete the design phase required for this project 
an additional million has been allocated in its budget to initiate construction of required improvements 
as discussed earlier  pennichuck estimates the total cost to comply with this new standard to be approximately million over the next three years although such estimates are subject to any future changes in the rule and changes in design and construction that may be required 
three of pennichuck s small community water systems have wells that produce water with arsenic levels in excess of the new standard of parts per billion which is effective in february pennichuck will install arsenic treatment systems at these locations  however  the expenditures necessary to comply with this standard are not expected to be a material part of our future capital expenditure program 
pennichuck s remaining community water systems have wells that produce water meeting the new arsenic standard 

table of contents capital expenditures associated with complying with federal and state water quality standards have historically been recognized and approved by the new hampshire puc for inclusion in our water rates  though there can be no assurance that the new hampshire puc will approve future rate increases in a timely or sufficient manner to cover our capital expenditures 
new accounting standards in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  as amended and revised in december fin r  which addresses the consolidation of a variable interest entity vie by a business enterprise that is the primary beneficiary 
a vie is an entity that does not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
the primary beneficiary of a vie is the enterprise with the majority of the risks or rewards associated with the vie 
application of fin r is required for all potential vies that are referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  and  for all other types of entities that are potential vies that are not referred to as special purpose entities  the consolidation requirements apply for periods ending after march  we have assessed the impact of fin r and determined that we do not have any vies for which the company is the primary beneficiary requiring consolidation of the entity as of december  for all other types of entities  the company is still assessing the impact that fin r will have on its consolidated financial position 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r addresses the accounting for transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the company or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas r also eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
sfas r is effective for periods beginning after june  the company is currently assessing the impact that sfas r will have on its consolidated financial statements
