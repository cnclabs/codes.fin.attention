executive summary during the fiscal year  we extended the capabilities of our core platform product by releasing vitria businessware version  adding support for the linux operating system and delivering new tools to help existing customers migrate to the current version of our platform 
vitria businessware version included significant enhancements in business process management and manageability as well as support for service oriented architectures 
in  we also released enhanced versions of two pre built process applica 
table of contents tions for the health insurance industry and developed a new pre built process application for order lifecycle management in the telecommunications industry 
our business process integration platform products have faced increasing competition over the past few years 
increasing competition was a primary factor in the decline in total license revenue from to we expect the intensity of our competition in platform sales to further increase as market adoption of lower level integration technologies like messaging  transformation  and web services continues to shift towards evolving industry standards supported by a broad range of software vendors 
consequently  we expect our pre built process applications product line to be our primary source of revenue growth in the years ahead 
by combining the power and flexibility of the vitria businessware platform with pre built content  we believe that our pre built process applications can provide more customer value  command higher prices  and offer us a more diverse revenue composition than our platform sales alone 
while our license revenue from applications fell short of our goals  we made significant progress by signing six customer contracts for these products in and by initiating development of several new applications 
in  we plan to increase investments in our pre built process applications product line and bring several new applications to market 
one or more of these planned new products will focus on managing process exceptions 
another application will help customers manage processes for receiving  validating  and distributing business documents sent by other companies 
we also expect to initiate development of other new pre built process applications  as well as enhance several of our existing ones 
the challenges on which our executives are most focused in include increasing sales of our existing pre built process applications  bringing new pre built process applications to market successfully  enhancing our platform products to better support our future applications as well as providing greater value to our platform customers  improving execution in sales and marketing  expanding our strategic alliances to increase our revenue opportunities  and renewing enterprise license agreements with some of our most important customers 
in addition  we plan to selectively invest in research and development and sales and marketing to strengthen our future growth  and at the same time  contain overall costs in order to reduce our net cash outflow 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts and restructuring charges 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue from sales of software licenses and related services 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  we record revenue from software licenses when a license agreement is signed by both parties  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the fee is probable and delivery of the product has occurred 
for electronic delivery  we consider our software products to have been delivered when the access code to download the software from the internet has been provided to the customer 
if an element of the agreement has not been delivered  revenue for the element is deferred based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for the undelivered element  all revenue is 
table of contents deferred until sufficient objective evidence exists or all elements have been delivered 
we treat all arrangements with payment terms longer than normal as having fees that are not fixed or determinable 
our normal payment terms currently range from net days to net days for domestic and international customers  respectively 
we defer revenue for those agreements which exceed our normal payment terms and are therefore assessed as not being fixed or determinable 
revenue under these agreements is recognized as payments become due unless collectibility concerns exist  in which case revenue is deferred until payments are received 
our assessment of collectibility is particularly critical in determining whether revenue should be recognized in the current market environment 
fees derived from arrangements with resellers are not recognized until evidence of a sell through arrangement to an end user has been received 
service revenue includes product maintenance  consulting and training 
customers who license our software products normally purchase maintenance services 
these maintenance contracts provide unspecified software upgrades and technical support over a specified term  which is typically twelve months 
maintenance contracts are usually paid in advance  and revenue from these contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
many of our customers use third party system integrators to implement our products 
customers typically purchase additional consulting services from us to support their implementation activities 
these consulting services are generally sold on a time and materials basis and recognized as the services are performed 
we also offer training services which are sold on a per student or per class basis 
fees from training services are recognized as classes are attended by customers 
payments received in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue 
in the event that a software license arrangement requires us to provide consulting services for significant production  customization or modification of the software  or when the customer considers these services essential to the functionality of our software product  both the product license revenue and consulting services revenue would be recognized in accordance with the provision of sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
in such event  we would recognize revenue from such arrangements using the percentage of completion method and  therefore  both the product license and consulting services revenue would be recognized as work progresses  using hours worked as input measures 
these arrangements have not been common and  therefore  the significant majority of our license revenue in the past three years has been recognized under sop  as amended 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to deliver required payments to us 
when we believe a collectibility issue exists with respect to a specific receivable  we record an allowance to reduce that receivable to the amount that we believe is collectible 
accounts days past due are typically fully reserved 
in addition  we record an allowance on the remainder of our receivables that are still in good standing 
when determining this allowance  we consider the probability of recoverability based on our past experience  taking into account current collection trends that are expected to continue  as well as general economic factors 
from this  we develop an allowance provision based on the percentage likelihood that our aged receivables will not be collected 
historically our actual losses have been consistent with our provisions 
customer accounts receivable balances are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when they are deemed uncollectible 
unexpected future events or significant future changes in trends could have a material impact on our future allowance provisions 
if the financial condition of our individual customers were to deteriorate in the future  or general economic conditions were to deteriorate and affect our customers ability to pay  our allowance expense could increase and have a material impact on our future statements of operations and cash flows 
restructuring charges we recorded million in restructuring charges related to the realignment of our business operations in and million in restructuring charges in as of december   we have million in accrued restructuring expenses consisting of lease payments for facilities we restructured in and only costs resulting from a restructuring plan that are not associated with  or that do not benefit activities that will be continued  are eligible for recognition as liabilities at the commitment date 
these charges 
table of contents represent expenses incurred in connection with certain cost reduction programs that we have undertaken and consist primarily of the cost of involuntary termination benefits and remaining contractual lease payments and other costs associated with closed facilities net of anticipated sublease income 
information regarding sublease income estimates for the amount of sublease income we are likely to receive and the timing of finding a tenant has been obtained from third party experts and is based on prevailing market rates 
the charges for facility closure costs require the extensive use of estimates  including estimates and assumptions related to future maintenance costs  our ability to secure sub tenants and anticipated sublease income to be received in the future 
if we fail to make accurate estimates or to complete planned activities in a timely manner  we might record additional charges or reverse previous charges in the future 
such additional charges or reversals will be recorded to the restructuring charges line in our statement of operations in the period in which additional information becomes available to indicate our estimates should be adjusted 
since april  we have revised our sublease income estimates at least semi annually due to significant downward trends in the real estate markets in the united states and in the united kingdom 
quarterly results of operations the following tables set forth statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december   as well as the percentage of our total revenue represented by each item

the unaudited financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements contained in this annual report and include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of this information 
you should read this information in conjunction with our annual audited financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report

license 
the license revenue that we recognize in any given period is directly related to the number and size of our license orders 
a few large license orders usually comprise a large percentage of our sales and as such our average license order size fluctuates significantly from period to period 
due to the rapidly changing business environment  we expect that we will continue to see fluctuations in the size of our average license order 
license revenue decreased from million in to million in while sales for our platform products declined in due to increased competition  our new application products fell short of our planned revenue targets because the sales cycle for these new products took longer than we expected 
from to we experienced a decline in license order volume and our average license order size declined as compared to the decrease in our license order volume in compared to year was due to the maturation of the market in which we compete for our platform products  which has resulted in fewer total orders as competition has increased for these products 
the decrease in the size of our average license order in as compared to was primarily due to the commoditization of the market for business integration platform products in which vitria businessware competes  which has resulted in downward pricing pressure for these products 
license revenue decreased from million in to million in from to we experienced a decline in license order volume 
during our average license order size increased as compared to the decrease in our license order volume in compared to year was due to the maturation of the market in which we compete for our platform products 
the increase in the size of our 
table of contents average license order in as compared to was primarily due to fact that a few large license orders comprised a large percentage of our sales in this period which increased our average license order size 
service and other 
the level of service revenue is affected by the number and size of license sales in a given period 
customers typically purchase maintenance for the first year as part of each license sale 
most of our consulting revenue and customer training revenue is also affected by the size and number of license deals 
service and other revenue includes revenue from support renewals  which are dependent upon our installed license base 
service revenue decreased from million in to million in consulting revenue decreased by million and first year support revenue decreased by million 
these declines were offset by an increase in maintenance renewal revenue of million from customers who had licensed our products in previous years 
also affecting the comparison to the prior year was million in non recurring government grant revenue recognized in service revenue decreased from million in to million in consulting revenue decreased by million  first year support revenue decreased by million and training revenue decreased by million  all related to our decrease in license revenue from the prior year 
these declines were offset by an increase in support renewal revenue of million from customers who had purchased our license products in previous years 
included in service and other revenue for was approximately million of revenue related to government grants received in prior years 
this revenue previously had been included in deferred revenue on the balance sheet since pending the outcome of several government audits  which were finalized in the fourth quarter of  because we had concluded that revenue under these arrangements were not fixed or determinable until the expiration of the audits 
we have no further government grant related deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  during  we experienced an increase in international revenue as a percentage of total revenue 
revenue from customers outside the united states increased to in  from in and in respectively 
the reason for the increase in in international revenue as a percentage of total revenue is due to a decline in total domestic revenue dollars compared to the prior year 
total international revenue dollars has remained approximately the same in as in revenue from our ten largest customers accounted for of total revenue in  of total revenue in and of total revenue in in all three years  no single customer accounted for more than of total revenue 
upc operations bv accounted for of our accounts receivable balance as of december  and california independent system operator accounted for of our accounts receivable balance as of december  we expect that revenue from a limited number of customers will continue to account for a large percentage of total revenue in future quarters 
therefore  the loss or delay of individual orders could have a significant impact on revenue 
our ability to attract new customers will depend on a variety of factors  including the reliability  security  scalability and the overall cost effectiveness of our products 
to date  we have not experienced significant seasonality of revenue 
however  we expect that future results may be affected by the fiscal or quarterly budget cycles of our customers 
cost of revenue license 
cost of license revenue consists of royalty payments to third parties for technology incorporated into our product 
fluctuations in cost of license revenue is generally due to the buying patterns of our customers  as cost of license revenue is dependent upon which products our customers purchase and which of those purchased products have third party technology incorporated into them 
cost of license revenue increased from  in to  in this increase in cost of license revenue was primarily due to the incorporation of new third party technology into products released and first sold in cost of license revenue decreased from million in to  in the decrease from to was primarily due to the write off during of a non cancelable royalty agreement that we determined would have no future utility to us 
future fluctuations in cost of license revenue is dependent upon increases or decreases in sales of those particular products which incorporate third party technology 

table of contents service and other 
cost of service revenue consists of salaries  facility costs  travel expenses and payments to third party consultants incurred in providing customer support  training and implementation services 
cost of service and other revenue remained relatively consistent  decreasing slightly from million in to million in the decrease in cost of service and other revenue was primarily due to a reduction in salary expense of million due to reduced headcount offset by an increase in contractor costs of million 
cost of service revenue decreased from million in to million in this decrease is primarily due to decreased salary expenses of million related to our restructuring actions at the end of the first quarter of as well as reduced travel expenses of million due to fewer consulting projects in than in the prior year 
we expect that cost of service and other will increase slightly in as compared to due to expected increases in headcount and travel expenses 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries  commissions  field office expenses  travel  entertainment and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to lower headcount which reduced salary and related expenses by million  depreciation and occupancy expenses by million and travel and entertainment expenses by million 
in addition  commission expense declined million due to lower headcount and lower license sales 
sales and marketing expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily the result of decreases in salary and benefit expenses of million and reduced travel expenses of million due to our workforce reduction in the first quarter of  lower commission expenses of million due to lower license revenue in also contributing to our decrease in were reduced expenses for outside consultants of million  lower marketing expenses of million and reduced lease and facilities costs of million  all due to our efforts to contain costs 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase slightly in as compared to due to increased headcount and increased commission expenses 
research and development 
research and development expenses include costs associated with the development of new products  enhancements to existing products  and quality assurance activities 
these costs consist primarily of employee salaries  benefits and the cost of consulting resources that supplement the internal development team 
research and development expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to reduced depreciation and occupancy charges of million  partially offset by an increase in offshore third party development expenses of  as we shifted some development work to india and china 
research and development costs have remained relatively flat compared to the prior year as we maintained productivity in order to develop new products and enhance existing products in research and development expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily the result of decreases in salary and benefits expenses of million due to workforce reduction in  lower external consulting expenses of  due to cost containment efforts and reduced facility costs of million due to our facilities restructuring in we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase slightly in as compared to due to increased headcount and increased commission expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries for administrative  executive and finance personnel  outside professional service fees  information systems costs and our provision for doubtful accounts 
general and administrative expenses remained essentially unchanged from million in to million in the slight decrease was primarily due to lower depreciation and occupancy expenses of  and lower travel related expenses of  offset by higher salary and related expense of  mainly related to severance charges for the departure of several key executives in 
table of contents the second quarter of and increased contractor costs of  primarily due to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
general and administrative expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of million in salary and benefits expenses and an  reduction in travel and related expenses as a result of our workforce reductions in  reduced tax and insurance expenses of  and a reduction of million in external consulting expenses as a result of our cost containment efforts 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will decrease slightly in as compared to due to the one time severance charges in stock based compensation 
total stock based compensation expenses were  in   in and million in stock based compensation includes the amortization of unearned employee stock based compensation on options issued to employees prior to our initial public offering in september amortization of unearned employee stock based compensation for options issued to employees prior to vitria s initial public offering in september was amortized over a five year period and has been fully amortized as of december  for the years ended december    and  we did not incur any stock based compensation in connection with stock issued to non employees for services rendered 
in  we issued a stock grant to all vitria employees 
each person who was a non executive employee on the date of the grant received shares of vitria common stock 
the fair market value of our common stock at the date of the grant was per share 
this stock grant resulted in stock based compensation expense of  in in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  we recorded  stock based compensation expense for stock option grant modifications made for a certain executive in in  we recorded  in stock based compensation expense as a result of stock option grant modification made for certain executives 
amortization and impairment of intangible assets 
amortization and impairment of purchased intangible assets associated with the acquisition of xml solutions in april resulted in charges to earnings of million for the year ended december  during  we performed an assessment of the carrying value of our intangible assets under the provision of statement of financial accounting standard sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  in light of sustained negative economic conditions which impacted our operations and expected future revenue 
as a result of this assessment  we recorded an additional impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of  effectively reducing the carrying value of all intangible assets to zero 
impairment of goodwill 
we accounted for the acquisition of xmlsolutions in april under the purchase method of accounting which resulted in million of goodwill being recorded at the time of purchase 
during  we performed an assessment of the carrying value of our goodwill 
the assessment was performed because our market capitalization had declined significantly  on what was considered to be an other than temporary basis  and because sustained negative economic conditions had affected our operations and expected future revenue 
as a result of this assessment  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to goodwill during  reducing the carrying value of goodwill to zero 
restructuring and other charges 
in we initiated actions to reduce our cost structure due to sustained negative economic conditions that affected our operations and resulted in lower than anticipated revenue 
the plan was a combination of a reduction in workforce of approximately employees  consolidations of facilities in the united states and united kingdom and the related disposal of leasehold improvements and equipment 
as a result of these restructuring actions  we incurred a charge of million in the year ended december  the restructuring charge included approximately million of severance related charges and million of committed excess facilities payments  which included  for the write off of leasehold improvements and equipment in vacated facilities 
in we initiated actions to further reduce our cost structure 
the plan was a combination of a reduction in workforce of approximately employees  consolidations of facilities in the united states and united kingdom and the related disposal of leasehold improvements and equipment 
as a result of these 
table of contents restructuring actions  we incurred a charge of million in the year ended december  the restructuring charge included approximately million of severance related charges and million of committed excess facilities payments  which included million for the write off of leasehold improvements and equipment in vacated facilities 
the charge also included  in accretion charges related to the fair value treatment for the facilities we restructured in  in accordance with sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
in the year ended december   we incurred million in restructuring costs 
these costs consisted of accretion expense due to the fair value treatments for those leases restructured in under sfas and adjustments we made to our estimates for future sublease income and other assumption of future costs  which we revise periodically based on current market conditions 
as of december   million related to facility closures remains accrued from all of our restructuring actions  which is net of million of estimated future sublease income 
a portion of this liability is based on the fair value treatment required by sfas  which we adopted as of january  the facilities consolidation charges for all of our restructuring actions were calculated using management s best estimates and were based upon the remaining future lease commitments for vacated facilities from the date of facility consolidation  net of estimated future sublease income 
we have engaged brokers to locate tenants to sublease all of the excess facilities  and  to date  have signed sublease agreements for two of the four remaining buildings 
the estimated costs of vacating these leased facilities were based on market information and trend analyses  including information obtained from third party real estate sources 
our ability to generate the estimated sublease income is highly dependent upon the existing economic conditions  particularly lease market conditions in certain geographies  at the time we negotiate the sublease arrangements with third parties 
while the amount we have accrued is our best estimate  these estimates are subject to change and may require routine adjustment as conditions change 
if macroeconomic conditions related to the commercial real estate market worsen  we may be required to increase our estimated cost to exit certain facilities 
in our estimated lease payout schedule in the table below in thousands  future lease payments for facilities are shown at actual contractual amounts and future sublease income is estimated based on third party estimates based on prevailing market rates 
on our consolidated balance sheets  liabilities for leases restructured in are carried at their fair value  which incorporates discounting the payments to their net present value 
and total estimated thereafter net payments undiscounted future lease payments and estimated operating costs for restructured facilities less contractual future sublease income less estimated future sublease income gross estimated future payments less discount factor due to fair value treatment of facilities restructured in net future payments on restructured facilities interest income and other income  net

based on the cumulative pre tax losses that we have sustained  a valuation allowance was recorded in an amount equal to the net deferred tax assets as of december    and as of december   we had deferred tax assets of approximately million  an increase of million from december  the increase in our valuation allowance was million for  net of true ups to prior years estimates

we also had federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively at december  the federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire beginning in  if not utilized 
the state net operating losses will expire beginning in the state tax credits carry forward indefinitely 
our ability to utilize the benefits of the nols and tax credit carryforwards is dependent on our generation of sufficient taxable income in future years

the downward trend in our revenue over the past three years has affected our cash flows  contributing to a negative cash flow from operations in   and our cash payments to employees and suppliers have exceeded our cash receipts from customers in each of these three years 
to compensate for our declining revenue  we restructured in and  closing facilities and reducing headcount

we need to continue to selectively invest in research and development to produce new products and in sales and marketing to sell those products in order to increase our revenue and improve our cash position

credit facilities with silicon valley bank we entered into a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank  dated june   for the purpose of establishing a revolving line of credit 
we modified this agreement on june  and reduced the line of credit from million to million 
the modification requires us to maintain minimum cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments balance of million 
the agreement also requires us to maintain our primary depository and operating accounts with silicon valley bank and invest all of our investments through silicon valley bank 
the line of credit serves as collateral for letters of credit and other commitments  even though these items do not constitute draws on the line of credit 
available advances under the line of credit are reduced by the amount of outstanding letters of credit and other commitments

the agreement is secured by all of our assets 
as of december   we had not borrowed against this line of credit 
in connection with the line of credit agreement  we have outstanding letters of credit of approximately million related to certain office leases at december  fees related to the outstanding letters of credit totaled  in operating capital and capital expenditure requirements estimated future uses of cash over the next twelve months are primarily to fund operations and to a lesser extent to fund capital expenditures 
for the next twelve months  we expect to fund these uses from cash 
table of contents generated from operations  interest generated from cash and investment balances  and cash and investment balances 
our ability to generate cash from operations is dependent upon our ability to sell our products and services and generate revenue  as well as our ability to manage our operating costs 
in turn  our ability to sell our products is dependent upon both the economic climate and the competitive factors in the marketplace in which we operate 
in the past  we have invested significantly in our operations 
we plan to selectively invest in research and development and sales and marketing in to strengthen our future growth  and at the same time  contain overall costs in order to reduce our net cash outflow 
for the next year  we anticipate that operating expenses and planned capital expenditures will continue to constitute a material use of our cash resources 
we expect our capital expenditures in the next year to be approximately million 
we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating expense requirements for at least the next twelve months 
at some point in the future we may require additional funds to support our working capital and operating expense requirements or for other purposes such as funding acquisitions or investments in other businesses 
if such funds are needed  we may seek to raise these additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings 
if we need to seek additional financing  there is no assurance that this additional financing will be available  or if available  will be on reasonable terms and not dilutive to our stockholders 
we believe our success requires expanding our customer base and continuing to enhance our vitria businessware products 
our revenue  operating results and cash flows depend upon the volume and timing of customer orders and payments and the date of product delivery 
historically  a substantial portion of revenue in a given quarter has been recorded in the third month of that quarter  with a concentration of this revenue in the last two weeks of the third month 
we expect this trend to continue and  therefore  any failure or delay in the closing of orders would have a material adverse effect on our quarterly operating results and cash flows 
since our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue and because a high percentage of these expenses are relatively fixed  a delay in the recognition of revenue from one or more license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and cause unexpected results 
revenue from contracts that do not meet our revenue recognition policy requirements for which we have been paid or have a valid receivable are recorded as deferred revenue 
while a portion of our revenue in each quarter is recognized from deferred revenue  our quarterly performance will depend primarily upon entering into new contracts to generate revenue for that quarter 
new contracts may not result in revenue during the quarter in which the contract was signed  and we may not be able to predict accurately when revenue from these contracts will be recognized 
our future operating results and cash flows will depend on many factors  including the following size and timing of customer orders and product and service delivery  level of demand for our professional services  changes in the mix of our products and services  ability to protect our intellectual property  actions taken by our competitors  including new product introductions and pricing changes  costs of maintaining and expanding our operations  timing of the development and release of new products or enhanced products  costs and timing of hiring qualified personnel  success in maintaining and enhancing existing relationships and developing new relationships with system integrators  technological changes in our markets  including changes in standards for computer and networking software and hardware  deferrals of customer orders in anticipation of product enhancements or new products  
table of contents delays in our ability to recognize revenue as a result of the decision by our customers to postpone software delivery  or because of changes in the timing of when delivery of products or services is completed  customer budget cycles and changes in these budget cycles  external economic conditions  availability of customer funds for software purchases given external economic factors  costs related to acquisition of technologies or businesses  ability to successfully integrate acquisitions  changes in strategy and capability of our competitors  and liquidity and timeliness of payments from international customers 
as a result of these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in this event  the price of our common stock would likely decline 
related party transactions in december  we sold our interest in our china operations to qilinsoft llc 
qilinsoft is owned and controlled by dr 
jomei chang  a director and a significant stockholder  and dr 
dale skeen  a director and our chief executive officer and chief technology officer  the spouse of dr 
chang and a significant stockholder 
vitria and qilinsoft also entered into a license agreement in december whereby qilinsoft received a royalty bearing license to distribute vitria products in china 
in addition  vitria and qilinsoft executed a development agreement in december pursuant to which qilinsoft will perform development work and other fee bearing services for us 
during the twelve months ended december   we recorded royalty license income of  from qilinsoft which is included in service revenue in our statements of operations 
during the year ended december   we incurred charges of  for development work performed by qilinsoft  which was recorded in research and development expense 
at december  we owed qilinsoft  for development work qilinsoft performed for us in the fourth quarter of which was paid by january  recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued sfas r  share based payment  which replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires compensation costs relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
the pro forma disclosure previously permitted under sfas will no longer be an acceptable alternative to recognition of expenses in the financial statements 
sfas r is effective as of the beginning of the first reporting period that begins after june   with early adoption encouraged 
we currently measure compensation costs related to share based payments under apb  as allowed by sfas  and provide disclosure in notes to financial statements as required by sfas we are required to adopt sfas r starting in the third fiscal quarter of we expect the adoption of sfas r will have a material adverse impact on our net income and net income per share 
we are currently in the process of evaluating the extent of such impact 
in december  fasb issued sfas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment to apb opinion this statement amends apb to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents in december  fasb staff position fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp fas was issued  providing guidance under sfas  accounting for income taxes for recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of  enacted on october  fsp fas allows time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effects of the jobs act before applying the requirements of fsp fas accordingly  we are evaluating the potential effects of the jobs act and have not adjusted our tax expense or deferred tax liability to reflect the requirements of fsp fas in march  the fasb issued eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which provided new guidance for assessing impairment losses on investments 
additionally  eitf includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb delayed the accounting provisions of eitf  however the disclosure requirements remain effective for annual periods ending after june  we will evaluate the impact of eitf once final guidance is issued 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements for the reasons described under the caption risks associated with vitria s business and future operating results 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio  which consists of short term money market instruments and debt securities with maturities between days and one year 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by monitoring the credit rating of investment issuers 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale  and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported  as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of tax 
unrealized losses at december  were  we have no cash flow exposure due to rate changes for cash equivalents and short term investments as all of these investments are at fixed interest rates 
there has been no material change in our interest rate exposure since december  the table below presents the principal amount of related weighted average interest rates for our investment portfolio 
short term investments are all in fixed rate instruments and have maturities of one year or less 
cash equivalent consist of money market funds and short term investments which have an original maturity date of days or less from the time of purchase 
table of investment securities in thousands as of december average average weighted average weighted average fair value interest rate fair value interest rate cash short term investments and cash equivalents total cash and investment securities 
table of contents foreign exchange risk as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
historically  our primary exposures have related to non us dollar denominated currencies  receivables  and inter company receivables or payables with our foreign subsidiaries 
additionally  we provide funding to our foreign subsidiaries in europe  asia pacific and latin america 
currently  short term intercompany balances with our foreign subsidiaries are in a net liability position with the us corporate headquarters 
the net liability position primarily comes from our subsidiary in japan  and the remaining foreign subsidiaries are in a net intercompany receivable position with the us corporate headquarters 
a strengthening of foreign exchange rates against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would result in an increase in the net intercompany payable  which is denominated in foreign currencies and due to corporate headquarters  of approximately  a weakening of foreign exchange rates against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would result in a decrease in the net intercompany payable  which is denominated in foreign currencies and due to corporate headquarters  of approximately  at december   our foreign subsidiaries had a net asset position of close to zero and thus a change in foreign exchange rates would not have materially affected our financial position 
in order to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations  from time to time  we utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency transaction exposures outstanding during the period 
the gains and losses on the forward contracts help to mitigate the gains and losses on our outstanding foreign currency transactions 
we do not enter into forward contracts for trading purposes 
all foreign currency transactions and all outstanding forward contracts are marked to market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses included in other income  net 
we had no outstanding forward contacts as of december  and did not enter into any forward contracts during risks associated with vitria s business and future operating results our operating results fluctuate significantly and an unanticipated decline in revenue may result in a decline in our stock price and may disappoint securities analysts or investors  and may also harm our relationship with our customers 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future 
if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price is likely to decline 
period to period comparisons of our historical results of operations are not necessarily a good predictor of our future performance 
our revenue and operating results depend upon the volume and timing of customer orders and payments and the date of product delivery 
historically  a substantial portion of revenue in a given quarter has been recorded in the third month of that quarter  with a concentration of this revenue in the last two weeks of the third month 
we expect this trend to continue and  therefore  any failure or delay in the closing of orders would have a material adverse effect on our quarterly operating results 
since our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue and because a high percentage of these expenses are relatively fixed  a delay in the recognition of revenue from one or more license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and cause unexpected results 
our quarterly results depend primarily upon entering into new or follow on contracts to generate revenue for that quarter 
new contracts may not result in revenue in the quarter in which the contract was signed  and we may not be able to predict accurately when revenue from these contracts will be recognized 
our operating results are also dependent upon our ability to manage our cost structure 

table of contents we have incurred substantial operating losses since inception and we cannot guarantee that we will become profitable in the future 
we have incurred substantial losses since inception as we funded the development of our products and the growth of our organization 
we have an accumulated deficit of million as of december  since the beginning of  we have reduced our workforce and consolidated certain facilities as part of our restructuring plan 
as a result of these actions  we incurred a charge of million in  million in  and million in despite these measures in order to remain competitive we intend to continue investing in sales  marketing and research and development 
as a result  we may report future operating losses and cannot guarantee whether we will report net income in the future 
our operating results are substantially dependent on license revenue from vitria businessware and our business could be materially harmed by factors that adversely affect the pricing and demand for vitria businessware 
since  a majority of our total revenue has been  and is expected to be  derived from the license of our vitria businessware product and for applications built for that product 
accordingly  our future operating results will depend on the demand for vitria businessware by existing and future customers  including new and enhanced releases that are subsequently introduced 
if our competitors release new products that are superior to vitria businessware in performance or price  or we fail to enhance vitria businessware and introduce new products in a timely manner  demand for our product may decline 
a decline in demand for vitria businessware as a result of competition  technological change or other factors would significantly reduce our revenue 
failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products could reduce our ability to compete and result in lower revenue 
during  we had a net loss of million and our operating activities used million of cash 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  million in working capital  million in short term liabilities  and million in long term liabilities 
we may need to raise additional funds  and we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
if we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms  we may not be able to  among other things develop or enhance our products and services  acquire technologies  products or businesses  expand operations  in the united states or internationally  hire  train and retain employees  or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital requirements 
our failure to do any of these things could result in lower revenue and could seriously harm our business 
the continued reluctance of companies to make significant expenditures on information technology could reduce demand for our products and cause our revenue to decline 
there can be no assurance that the level of spending on information technology in general  or on business integration software by our customers and potential customers  will increase or remain at current levels in future periods 
lower spending on information technology could result in reduced license sales to our customers  reduced overall revenue  diminished margin levels  and could impair our operating results in future periods 
any general delay in capital expenditures may cause a decrease in sales  may cause an increase in our accounts receivable and may make collection of license and support payments from our customers more difficult 
a general slow down in capital spending  if sustained in future periods  could result in reduced sales or the postponement of sales to our customers 

table of contents we experience long and variable sales cycles  which could have a negative impact on our results of operations for any given quarter 
our products are often used by our customers to deploy mission critical solutions used throughout their organization 
customers generally consider a wide range of issues before committing to purchase our products  including product benefits  ability to operate with existing and future computer systems  ability to accommodate increased transaction volume and product reliability 
many customers will be addressing these issues for the first time 
as a result  we or other parties  including system integrators  must educate potential customers on the use and benefits of our product and services 
in addition  the purchase of our products generally involves a significant commitment of capital and other resources by a customer 
this commitment often requires significant technical review  assessment of competitive products  and approval at a number of management levels within the customer s organization 
because of these issues  our sales cycle has ranged from six to nine months  and in some cases even longer  and it is very difficult to predict whether and when any particular license transaction might be completed 
because a small number of customers have in the past accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue  our revenue could decline due to the loss or delay of a single customer order 
sales to our ten largest customers accounted for of total revenue in the fiscal year ended december  our license agreements do not generally provide for ongoing license payments 
therefore  we expect that revenue from a limited number of customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of total revenue in future quarters 
our ability to attract new customers will depend on a variety of factors  including the reliability  security  scalability  breadth and depth of our products  and the cost effectiveness of our products 
the loss or delay of individual orders could have a significant impact on revenue and operating results 
our failure to add new customers that make significant purchases of our product and services would reduce our future revenue 
if we are not successful in developing industry specific pre built process applications based on vitria businessware  our ability to increase future revenue could be harmed 
we have developed and intend to continue to develop pre built process applications based on vitria businessware which incorporate business processes  connectivity and document transformations specific to the needs of particular industries  including healthcare and insurance  telecommunications  manufacturing  finance and other industries 
this presents technical and sales challenges and requires collaboration with third parties  including system integrators and standard organizations  and the commitment of significant resources 
specific industries may experience economic downturns or regulatory changes that may result in delayed spending decisions by customers or require changes to our products 
if we are not successful in developing these targeted pre built process applications or these pre built process applications do not achieve market acceptance  our ability to increase future revenue could be harmed 
to date we have concentrated our sales and marketing efforts toward companies in the healthcare and insurance  financial services  telecommunication and other vertical markets 
customers in these vertical markets are likely to have different requirements and may require us to change our product design or features  sales methods  support capabilities or pricing policies 
if we fail to successfully address the needs of these vertical markets we may experience decreased sales in future periods 
our products may not achieve market acceptance  which could cause our revenue to decline 
deployment of our products requires interoperability with a variety of software applications and systems and  in some cases  the ability to process a high number of transactions per second 
if our products fail to satisfy these demanding technological objectives  our customers will be dissatisfied and we may be unable to generate future sales 
failure to establish a significant base of customer references will significantly reduce our ability to license our product to additional customers 

table of contents our markets are highly competitive and  if we do not compete effectively  we may suffer price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
the market for our products and solutions is intensely competitive  evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
the intensity of competition is expected to increase in the future 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any one of which could significantly reduce our future revenue 
our current and potential competitors include  bea  fiarano  filenet  fuego  ibm corporation  intalio  microsoft corporation  oracle peoplesoft  polarlake  sap  savvion  seebeyond technology  sonic software  sungard  tibco software  telcordia  trizetto  webmethods and others 
in the future  some of these companies may expand their products to provide or enhance existing business process management  business analysis and monitoring  and business vocabulary management functionality  as well as integration solutions for specific business problems 
these or other competitors may merge to attempt the creation of a more competitive entity or one that offers a broader solution than we provide 
in addition  in house information technology departments of potential customers have developed or may develop systems that provide for some or all of the functionality of our products 
we expect that internally developed application integration and process automation efforts will continue to be a principal source of competition for the foreseeable future 
in particular  it can be difficult to sell our product to a potential customer whose internal development group has already made large investments in and progress towards completion of systems that our product is intended to replace 
finally  we face direct and indirect competition from major enterprise software developers that offer integration products as a complement to their other enterprise software products 
these companies may also modify their applications to be more easily integrated with other applications through web services or other means 
some of these companies include oracle peoplesoft and sap ag 
many of our competitors have more resources and broader customer and partner relationships than we do 
in addition  many of these competitors have extensive knowledge of our industry 
current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to offer a single solution and increase the ability of their products to address customer needs 
although we believe that our solutions generally compete favorably with respect to these factors  our market is relatively new and is evolving rapidly 
we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors  especially those with significantly greater resources 
the cost and difficulty in implementing our product could significantly harm our reputation with customers  diminishing our ability to license additional products to our customers 
our products are often purchased as part of large projects undertaken by our customers 
these projects are complex  time consuming and expensive 
failure by customers to successfully deploy our products  or the failure by us or third party consultants to ensure customer satisfaction  could damage our reputation with existing and future customers and reduce future revenue 
in many cases  our customers must interact with  modify  or replace significant elements of their existing computer systems 
the costs of our products and services represent only a portion of the related hardware  software  development  training and consulting costs 
the significant involvement of third parties  including system integrators  reduces the control we have over the implementation of our products and the quality of customer service provided to organizations which license our software 
if our products do not operate with the many hardware and software platforms used by our customers  our business may fail 
we currently serve a customer base with a wide variety of constantly changing hardware  packaged software applications and networking platforms 
if our products fail to gain broad market acceptance  due to their inability to support a variety of these platforms  our operating results may suffer 
our business depends  among others  on the following factors our ability to integrate our product with multiple platforms and existing  or legacy  systems and to modify our products as new versions of packaged applications are introduced  the portability of our products  particularly the number of operating systems and databases that our products can source or target  
table of contents our ability to anticipate and support new standards  especially internet standards  the integration of additional software modules under development with our existing products  and our management of software being developed by third parties for our customers or use with our products 
if we fail to introduce new versions and releases of our products in a timely manner  our revenue may decline 
we may fail to introduce or deliver new products on a timely basis  if at all 
in the past  we have experienced delays in the commencement of commercial shipments of our vitria businessware products 
to date  these delays have not had a material impact on our revenue 
if new releases or products are delayed or do not achieve market acceptance  we could experience a delay or loss of revenue and cause customer dissatisfaction 
in addition  customers may delay purchases of our products in anticipation of future releases 
if customers defer material orders in anticipation of new releases or new product introductions  our revenue may decline 
our products rely on third party programming tools and applications 
if we lose access to these tools and applications  or are unable to modify our products in response to changes in these tools and applications  our revenue could decline 
our programs utilize java programming technology provided by sun microsystems 
we also depend upon access to the interfaces  known as apis  used for communication between external software products and packaged application software 
our access to apis of third party applications are controlled by the providers of these applications 
if the application provider denies or delays our access to apis  our business may be harmed 
some application providers may become competitors or establish alliances with our competitors  increasing the likelihood that we would not be granted access to their apis 
we also license technology related to the connectivity of our product to third party database and other applications and we incorporate some third party technology into our product offerings 
loss of the ability to use this technology  delays in upgrades  failure of these third parties to support these technologies  or other difficulties with our third party technology partners could lead to delays in product shipment and could cause our revenue to decline 
we could suffer losses and negative publicity if new versions and releases of our products contain errors or defects 
our products and their interactions with customers software applications and it systems are complex and  accordingly  there may be undetected errors or failures when products are introduced or as new versions are released 
we have in the past discovered software errors in our new releases and new products after their introduction that have resulted in additional research and development expenses 
to date  these additional expenses have not been material 
we may in the future discover errors in new releases or new products after the commencement of commercial shipments 
since many customers are using our products for mission critical business operations  any of these occurrences could seriously harm our business and generate negative publicity 
if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel  our ability to compete will be harmed 
we depend on the continued service of our key technical  sales and senior management personnel 
none of these employees are bound by an employment agreement 
the loss of senior management or other key research  development  sales and marketing personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results 
in addition  we must attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
we face significant competition for individuals with the skills required to develop  market and support our products and services 
we cannot assure that we will be able to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of these highly skilled employees 

table of contents if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights  we may lose these rights and our business may be seriously harmed 
we depend upon our ability to develop and protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights to distinguish our products from our competitors products 
the use by others of our proprietary rights could materially harm our business 
we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as confidentiality agreements and licensing arrangements  to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  existing laws afford only limited protection 
attempts may be made to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our proprietary rights against unauthorized third party copying or use 
furthermore  policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult and expensive litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights 
our products could infringe the intellectual property rights of others causing costly litigation and the loss of significant rights 
software developers in our market are increasingly being subject to infringement claims as the number of products in different software industry segments overlap 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  prevent product shipment or cause delays  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could harm our business 
patent litigation in particular involves complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties 
in the event an infringement claim against us is successful and we cannot obtain a license on acceptable terms or license a substitute technology or redesign our product to avoid infringement  our business would be harmed 
furthermore  former employers of our current and future employees may assert that our employees have improperly disclosed to us or are using confidential or proprietary information 
our significant international operations may fail to generate significant product revenue or contribute to our drive toward profitability  which could result in slower revenue growth and harm our business 
we have international presence in australia  canada  france  germany  italy  japan  korea  singapore  spain and the united kingdom 
during  of our revenue was derived from international markets 
there are a number of challenges to establishing and maintaining operations outside of the united states and we may be unable to continue to generate significant international revenue 
if we fail to successfully establish or maintain products in international markets  we could experience slower revenue growth and our business could be harmed 
in addition  it also may be difficult to protect our intellectual property in certain international jurisdictions 
we are at risk of securities class action litigation due to our expected stock price volatility 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities 
this risk is especially acute for us because technology companies have experienced greater than average stock price volatility in recent years and  as a result  have been subject to  on average  a greater number of securities class action claims than companies in other industries 
in november  vitria and certain of our officers and directors were named as defendants in a class action shareholder complaint 
this litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  and could seriously harm our business 
see item of part i legal proceedings for more information regarding this litigation 
we have implemented anti takeover provisions which could discourage or prevent a takeover  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions of delaware law  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
these provisions include establishment of a classified board of directors requiring that not all members of the board of directors may be elected at one time  
table of contents authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt  prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates  limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
section of the delaware general corporations law and the terms of our stock option plans may also discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of vitria 
in addition  as of december   our executive officers  directors and their affiliates beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
this could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of vitria and may make some transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders
