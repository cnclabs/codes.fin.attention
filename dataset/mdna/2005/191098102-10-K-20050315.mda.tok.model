revenue management revenue management includes striking the appropriate balance between generating growth in volume  gross margin and market share 
it requires a strategy which reflects consideration for pricing of brands and packages within channels  as well as highly effective working relationships with customers and a fact based decision making discipline 
revenue management has been and continues to be a key driver which has significant impact on the company s operating income performance 
product innovation as volume growth of carbonated soft drinks in our industry has slowed over the past several years  innovation of both brands and packages has been and will continue to be critical to the company s overall volume 
the company successfully introduced diet coke with lime  a brand extension of diet coke  in the first quarter of and introduced coca cola c  a mid calorie cola  in june the company was the first coca cola bottler to use fridge pack packaging several years ago

total distribution costs amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
over the past several years  the company has focused on converting its distribution system from a conventional routing system to a predictive or pre sell system 
this conversion to a pre sell system has allowed the company to more efficiently handle an increasing number of brands and packages 
in addition  the company has closed a number of smaller sales distribution centers reducing its fixed warehouse related costs 
distribution cost management will continue to be a key area of emphasis for the company for the next several years 
productivity to achieve improvements in operating performance over the long term  the company s gross margin must grow faster than the growth in selling  delivery and administrative s  d a expenses

gross margin increased approximately in compared to due to higher net sales 
however  the company s gross margin percentage declined slightly due to higher raw material costs and higher expense related to the reclassification of certain items from property  plant and equipment to inventories at the beginning of the company expects its raw material packaging costs to increase significantly in the company believes it can increase selling prices to offset its increased costs in however  if the company is unable to increase selling prices  increase bottle can volume or reduce expenses to offset the anticipated higher raw material costs  income from operations may be negatively impacted in income from operations decreased approximately in compared to the decrease was due to higher s  d a expenses offset somewhat by higher gross margin and lower depreciation expense

discussion of critical accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  the company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial position in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

table of contents the company has not made changes in any critical accounting policies during any significant changes in critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors of the company during the quarter in which a change is contemplated and prior to making such change 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the collectibility of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors 
in circumstances where the company becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to the company  a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the company believes will ultimately be collected 
in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts  bad debt charges are recorded based on the company s recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding 
the company s review of potential bad debts considers the specific industry a particular customer operates in  such as supermarket retailers  convenience stores and mass merchandise retailers  and the general economic conditions that currently exist in that specific industry 
the company then considers the effects of concentration of credit risk in a specific industry and for specific customers within that industry 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to the company s business model or changes in the company s capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from the company s current estimates 
factors such as changes in the planned use of manufacturing equipment  vending equipment  transportation equipment  warehouse facilities or software could also result in shortened useful lives 
in those cases where the company determines that the useful life of property  plant and equipment should be shortened  the company would depreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated salvage value over its revised remaining useful life 
the company evaluates long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
when undiscounted future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover an asset s carrying amount  the asset is written down to its fair value and the company recognizes an impairment loss 
franchise rights the company considers franchise rights with the coca cola company and other franchisers to be indefinite lived because the agreements are perpetual or  in situations where agreements are not perpetual  the company anticipates the agreements will continue to be renewed upon expiration 
the cost of renewals is minimal and the company has not had any renewals denied 
the company considers franchise rights as indefinite lived intangible assets under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas no 
and therefore  does not amortize the value of such assets 
instead  franchise rights are tested at least annually for impairment 
impairment testing of franchise rights and goodwill the only intangible assets the company classifies as indefinite lived are franchise rights and goodwill 
sfas no 
requires testing of intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill for impairment at least annually 
the company conducts its annual impairment test in the third quarter of each fiscal year 
the company also reviews intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill for impairment if there are significant changes in business conditions 
for the annual impairment analysis of franchise rights  the fair value for the company s acquired franchise rights is estimated using a multi period excess earnings approach 
this approach involves projecting future 
table of contents earnings  discounting those estimated earnings using an appropriate discount rate and subtracting a contributory charge for net working capital  property  plant and equipment  assembled workforce and customer relationships to arrive at excess earnings attributable to franchise rights 
the present value of the excess earnings attributable to franchise rights is their estimated fair value and is compared to the carrying value on an aggregate basis 
based on this analysis  there was no impairment of the company s recorded franchise rights in the projection of earnings includes a number of assumptions such as projected net sales  cost of sales  operating expenses and income taxes 
changes in the assumptions required to estimate the present value of the excess earnings attributable to franchise rights could materially impact the fair value estimate 
for the annual impairment analysis of goodwill  the company develops an estimated fair value for the enterprise using an average of three different approaches market value  using the company s stock price plus outstanding debt and minority interest  discounted cash flow analysis  and multiple of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization based upon relevant industry data 
the estimated fair value of the enterprise is then compared to the company s carrying amount including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value of the company exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill will be considered not to be impaired and the second step of the sfas no 
impairment test will not be necessary 
if the carrying amount including goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value  the second step of the impairment test will be performed to measure the amount of the impairment  if any 
based on this analysis  there was no impairment of the company s recorded goodwill in the discounted cash flow analysis includes a number of assumptions such as projected sales volume  net sales  cost of sales and operating expenses 
changes in these assumptions could materially impact the fair value estimate of the enterprise 
deferred tax assets the company records a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of its deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period in which such determination was made 
a reduction in the valuation allowance and corresponding adjustment to income may be required if the likelihood of realizing existing deferred tax assets were to increase 
the company regularly reviews the realizability of deferred tax assets and initiates a review when significant changes in the company s business occur 
pension and postretirement benefit obligations the company sponsors pension plans covering substantially all full time nonunion employees and certain union employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  employee turnover  age at retirement and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company  within certain guidelines 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net periodic pension cost recorded by the company in future periods 
in  the discount rate used in determining the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation for the company s pension plans decreased to from in due to declining interest rates for long term corporate bonds  which serve as the 
table of contents benchmark for determination of the discount rate 
the discount rate assumption is generally the estimate which can have the most significant impact on net periodic pension cost and the projected benefit obligation for these pension plans 
the company determines an appropriate discount rate annually based on the annual yield on long term corporate bonds as of the measurement date 
a 
increase or decrease in the discount rate assumption at the beginning of would have impacted the projected benefit obligation and net periodic pension cost as follows in thousands 
increase 
decrease impact on projected benefit obligation at january  net periodic pension cost in the weighted average expected long term rate of return of plan assets was for and and for this rate reflects an estimate of long term future returns for the pension plan assets 
this estimate is primarily a function of the asset classes equities versus fixed income in which the pension plan assets are invested and the analysis of past performance of these asset classes over a long period of time 
this analysis includes expected long term inflation and the risk premiums associated with equity and fixed income investments 
the company sponsors a postretirement health care plan for employees meeting specified qualifying criteria 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the net periodic postretirement benefit cost and postretirement benefit obligation for this plan 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate and the expected growth rate for the cost of health care benefits 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected liability under this plan 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
the company does not pre fund its postretirement benefits and has the right to modify or terminate certain of these benefits in the future 
the discount rate assumption  the annual health care cost trend and the ultimate trend rate for health care costs are key estimates which can have a significant impact on the net periodic postretirement benefit cost and postretirement obligation in future periods 
the company annually determines the health care cost trend based on recent actual medical trend experience and projected experience for the following years 
a 
increase or decrease in the discount rate assumption at the beginning of would have impacted the projected benefit obligation and net periodic postretirement benefit cost as follows in thousands

results of operations compared to net income the company reported net income of million or per basic share for compared with net income of million or per share for the most significant difference between and was an increase in the company s effective income tax rate from in to in net sales the company s net sales increased approximately in compared to this increase in net sales reflected approximately growth in average revenue per case on flat bottle can volume 
the company s results of operations included four additional selling days in compared to the company s contract 
table of contents net sales and post mix net sales increased to million and million in compared to million and million in  respectively 
some of the factors contributing to the flat bottle can volume in are discussed below volume of carbonated soft drinks in the soft drink industry has been soft with volume declines in sugar carbonated soft drinks offset somewhat by volume growth from diet carbonated soft drinks  isotonics and bottled water 
some of the company s largest customers are chain supermarkets 
during  certain chain supermarket customers were less aggressive in their promotion of the company s products resulting in volume declines for those customers 
the company s volume in the supermarket channel has been negatively impacted by less aggressive pricing by certain retailers in this channel over the past two years 
large portions of the company s bottling territory experienced unseasonably cool weather in august and several tropical storms during september which contributed to the decline in net sales during the third quarter of the tropical storms during september had a more significant impact on the bottle can volume in immediate consumption channels 
while overall carbonated bottle can volume in was relatively flat compared to  bottle can volume of the company s carbonated diet products increased by approximately 
for the company s noncarbonated beverage portfolio  which includes bottled water  juices and isotonics  bottle can volume increased by approximately in bottle can volume increases in for dasani of approximately and for powerade of approximately were partially offset by a decrease in other noncarbonated products 
noncarbonated beverages comprised of the overall bottle can volume in compared to in product innovation during also impacted net sales 
the company introduced coca cola c  a mid calorie product from the coca cola company  during june and diet coke with lime during the first quarter of diet coke with lime and coca cola c represented approximately of the company s bottle can volume during product innovation will continue to be critical to the company s overall bottle can volume in the future

the company s largest customer wal mart stores  inc accounted for approximately of the company s total bottle can volume and the second largest customer food lion  llc accounted for approximately of the company s total bottle can volume during wal mart stores  inc accounted for approximately of the company s total net sales 
all of the company s sales are to customers in the united states 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased from in to in primarily as a result of increases in the company s cost of sales 
the company s gross margins may not be comparable to other companies  since some entities include all costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales and the company excludes a portion of these costs from gross margin  including them instead in s  d a expenses 
cost of sales cost of sales on a per unit basis increased approximately in compared to the increase was primarily due to higher raw material costs and higher expense related to the reclassification of certain items from property  plant and equipment to inventories at the beginning of cost of sales includes the following raw 
table of contents material costs  manufacturing labor  manufacturing overhead  inbound freight charges related to raw materials  receiving costs  inspection costs  manufacturing warehousing costs and freight charges related to the movement of finished goods from manufacturing locations to sales distribution centers 
based upon information currently available  the company anticipates that cost of sales on a per unit basis will increase to in primarily due to higher packaging costs  especially pet bottles 
if the company is unable to increase selling prices  increase bottle can volume or reduce expenses to offset the anticipated higher raw material costs  income from operations may be impacted in in  the coca cola company offered  through a program called strategic growth initiative sgi  an opportunity for the company to receive marketing funding support  subject to the company s achievement of certain volume performance requirements 
the company recorded million as a reduction in cost of sales related to sgi during the sgi program was eliminated in  however  the coca cola company offset the impact of the elimination of the sgi program by adjusting the price of concentrate as of january  on may   the coca cola company changed its method of delivering marketing funding support to the company for bottle can products 
subsequent to may   the majority of the company s marketing funding support for bottle can products from the coca cola company was delivered as an offset against the price of concentrate 
the reduction in concentrate price represents a significant portion of the marketing funding support that otherwise would have been paid to the company related to the sale of bottle can products of the coca cola company 
due to this change in concentrate pricing  the company s investment in inventories was reduced  resulting in a one time increase in cost of sales of million in the second quarter of as a result of this change in pricing  the amounts received in cash from the coca cola company for marketing funding support decreased significantly in as compared to the prior year as discussed below 
cost of sales for included favorable nonrecurring items of approximately million  primarily for certain customer related marketing programs between the company and the coca cola company  which were recorded in the first quarter of as marketing funding support and were reflected as a reduction of cost of sales 
at the beginning of  the company reclassified plastic shells  premix tanks and co tanks  which totaled million  from property  plant and equipment to inventories 
these items were reclassified as the company believes that they are more closely related to the sale of finished product inventories than to a component of property  plant and equipment

during  the company and all other coca cola bottlers in the united states formed coca cola bottling sales and services company  llc ccbss for the purpose of facilitating various procurement functions and distributing certain specified beverage products of the coca cola company 
ccbss is responsible for negotiating contracts for most of the significant raw materials purchased by the company 
the company anticipates that in future years ccbss will increase purchasing efficiency for coca cola bottlers and help reduce future increases in cost of sales and other operating expenses 
the company relies extensively on advertising and sales promotion in the marketing of its products 
the coca cola company and other beverage companies that supply concentrates  syrups and finished products to the company make substantial marketing and advertising expenditures to promote sales in the local territories served by the company 
the company also benefits from national advertising programs conducted by the coca cola company and other beverage companies 
certain of the marketing expenditures by the coca cola company and other beverage companies are made pursuant to annual arrangements 
although the coca cola company has advised the company that it intends to provide marketing funding support in  it is not obligated to do so under the company s bottle contracts 
significant decreases in marketing funding support from the coca cola company or other beverage companies could adversely impact operating results of the company 
total marketing funding support from the coca cola company and other beverage companies  which includes direct payments to the company and payment to customers for marketing program payments  was

the capitalization of this lease reduced s  d a expenses by million in as compared to fuel costs for related to the movement of finished goods from sales distribution centers to customer locations increased by approximately or million over fuel costs increased primarily due to both higher usage and higher rates for fuel 
over the last three years  the company has converted significantly all of its distribution system from a conventional sales method to a pre sell method in which sales personnel either visit or call a customer to determine the customer s requirements for their order 
this pre sell method has enabled the company to add a significant number of new product and package combinations and provides the capacity to add additional product offerings in the future 
the company closed three sales distribution centers during in addition to four sales distribution centers closed in the company believes that these sales distribution center closings along with changes in its methods of distribution will reduce overall costs and improve productivity in the future

the company periodically uses interest rate hedging products to modify risk from interest rate fluctuations 
the company has historically altered its fixed floating rate mix based upon anticipated cash flows from operations relative to the company s overall financial condition 
sensitivity analyses are performed to review the impact on the company s financial position and coverage of various interest rate movements

as it relates to the company s variable rate debt and variable rate leases  assuming no changes in the company s financial structure  if market interest rates average more in than the interest rates as of january   interest expense for would increase by approximately million 
this amount was determined by calculating the effect of the hypothetical interest rate on our variable rate debt and variable rate leases after giving consideration to all our interest rate hedging activities

raw material and commodity price risk the company is subject to commodity price risk arising from price movements for certain commodities included as part of its raw materials 
the company manages this risk in some cases by entering into contracts with adjustable prices 
the company has not used derivative commodity instruments in the management of this risk 
effect of changing prices the principal effect of inflation on the company s operating results is to increase costs 
subject to normal competitive market conditions  the company believes it has the ability to raise selling prices to offset these cost increases over time
