item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company has developed criteria for determining whether a shipment should be recorded as a sale or as a deferred sale a balance sheet liability 
the criteria for recording a cod sale  or payments prior to shipment sale or sale financed through third party floor plan arrangements  are that the boat has been completed and shipped to a dealer or to the government  that title has passed to the dealer or to the government  and that there is no direct commitment to repurchase the boat or to pay floor plan interest beyond the sales program terms 
as described more fully below at business environment  most of the company s shipments to dealers were financed through floor plan arrangements with third party lenders pursuant to which the company is subject to repurchase boats repossessed by the third party lenders if the dealer defaults under his credit arrangement 
the company has no repurchase liability for the balance of shipments 
this is the method of sales recognition believed to be in use by most boat manufacturers 
at june    and  there were no commitments to dealers to pay the interest on floor plan financed boats in excess of the time period specified in the company s written sales program and there were no direct repurchase agreements 
there were no deferred sales or cost of sales estimated at june    and the company has a contingent liability to repurchase boats where it participates in the floor plan financing made available to its dealers by third party finance companies  aggregating to  and  at june  and  respectively 
sales to participating dealers are approved by the respective finance companies 
if a participating dealer does not satisfy its obligation to the lender and the boat is subsequently repossessed by the lender  then the company may be required to repurchase the boat

results of operations 
operating profit was  for fiscal  as compared to  in and  in fiscal operating profit for fiscal was not at an optimum level through the first three quarters because of productivity issues outlined above in the gross margin discussion of this report and increased administrative expenses 
construction in the manufacturing facilities for increased capacity and optimization of production efficiencies was completed during the third quarter and the company realized profitability improvements in the latter part of that quarter

for these reasons and because the company has generated operating tax losses in recent years  the company has elected to provide for a tax asset valuation allowance of  at june  and  at june  currently  the tax asset valuation allowance is adjusted to equal the amount by which total deferred tax assets exceed total deferred tax liabilities 
as operating results and the economy stabilize and future sales volumes and profitability increase  consideration will be given to reducing or eliminating the valuation allowance

additionally the company has maintained a historical sales backlog through the date of this report 
effects of inflation 
the company has not been materially affected by the moderate inflation of recent years 
since most of the company s plant and its equipment are relatively new  expenditures for replacements are not expected to be a factor in the near term future 
when raw material costs increase because of inflation  the company attempts to minimize the effect of these increases by using alternative  less costly materials  or by finding less costly sources for the materials it uses 
when the foregoing measures are not possible  selling prices are increased to recover the cost increases 
the company s products are targeted at the segment of the powerboat market where retail purchasers are generally less significantly affected by price or other economic conditions 
consequently  management believes that the impact of inflation on sales and the results of operations will not be material

critical accounting policies 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of reported assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the company discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and believes the following are the most critical accounting policies that could have an effect on the company s reported results

the company s revenue is derived primarily from the sale of boats 
revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of the sale  primarily upon shipment to dealers  once the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company offers discounts and sales incentives 
the estimated liability for sales incentives is recorded at the later of the time of program communication to the customer or at the time of sale in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of a vendor s products

if actual costs are different from estimated costs  the recorded value of the liability would be adjusted 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
the company records an allowance for uncollectible trade receivables based upon currently known bad debt risks and provides reserves based on past loss history  customer payment practices and economic conditions 
actual collection experience may differ from the current estimate of reserves 
changes to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required if a future event or other circumstance results in a change in the estimate of the ultimate collectibility of a specific account or note 
reserve for obsolete inventories 
the company records a reserve for obsolete inventories in order to ensure inventories are carried at the lower of cost or fair market value 
fair market value can be affected by assumptions about market demand and conditions  historical usage rates  model changes and new product introductions 
if model changes or new product introductions create more or less than favorable market conditions  the reserve for obsolete inventories may need to be adjusted 
refer to note  nature of the business and significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the basis of accounting for inventories 
warranty reserves 
the company records a liability for standard product warranties 
the liability is recorded using historical warranty experience to estimate projected warranty costs 
if necessary  the company adjusts its liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and are reasonably estimable 
the company s warranty reserves are affected by product failure rates and material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if these estimated costs differ from actual product failure rates  and actual material usage and labor costs  a revision to the warranty reserve would be required 
income taxes

the judgments made at any point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits and settlements of tax litigation  as well as changes due to new tax laws and regulations and the company s interpretations of those laws and regulations 
these factors may cause the tax rate for the company to increase or decrease
