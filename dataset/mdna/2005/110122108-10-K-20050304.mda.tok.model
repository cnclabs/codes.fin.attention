in support of its mission to extend and enhance human life by developing the highest quality products  in  the company invested billion in research and development  a growth over  and expects to increase spending on drug development in to accelerate the development of its late stage pipeline 
research and development dedicated to pharmaceutical products  including milestone payments for in licensing and development programs  was billion and as a percentage of pharmaceutical sales was compared to in in august  the company announced it entered into a settlement with the united states securities and exchange commission sec  concluding the sec s investigation regarding wholesaler inventory and accounting matters 
the settlement was reached through a consent order under which the company is currently operating 
the sec s investigation arose from the company s announcement in april that the company experienced a substantial buildup of wholesaler inventories in its us pharmaceuticals business over several years  primarily in and  and that the buildup was primarily due to sales incentives offered by the company  as well as the company s subsequent restatement restatement of its consolidated financial statements for the period ended december  and prior periods in march for a discussion of these matters  see restatement of previously issued financial statement and sec consent order below 
to help ensure the circumstances that led to the need for financial restatement do not recur  the company has taken steps to enhance the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures  including internal control over financial reporting 
after completing the restatement  the company continued to identify and implement actions to improve the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting 
these actions contributed significantly to the company identifying additional errors relating to prior periods not reflected in the restatement and accordingly  the company restated its consolidated financial statements in to correct these errors for the years and the company continues to strengthen disclosure controls and procedures surrounding internal controls over financial reporting  specifically with respect to section of the sarbanes oxley act of these actions include the establishment of policies and procedures to enhance compliance and focus on risk management 
business environment the pharmaceutical industry in which the company conducts its business is highly competitive and subject to numerous government regulations 
sales of the company s products can be affected significantly by many competitive factors  including product efficacy  safety  price and cost effectiveness  marketing effectiveness  product labeling  quality control and quality assurance of its manufacturing  operating and research and development of new products 
to successfully compete for business in the healthcare industry  the company must not only demonstrate that its products offer medical benefits  but also cost advantages 
currently  most of the new products introduced by the company must compete with other products in the same therapeutic category already on the market 
the company manufactures branded products  which are subject to higher prices than generic products 
generic competition is one of the company s biggest challenges globally 

table of contents in the pharmaceutical industry  the majority of an innovative product s commercial value is usually realized during the period in which the product has market exclusivity 
when a product loses exclusivity  it is no longer protected by a patent and is subject to new competing products in the form of generic brands 
upon exclusivity loss of a product  the company can lose a major portion of that product s sales in a short period of time 
for further discussion on product exclusivity  see item business intellectual property and product exclusivity 
both in the us and internationally  the healthcare industry is subject to various government imposed regulations which authorize prices or price controls which could have an impact on the company s sales 
in the us  congress and some state legislatures have considered a number of proposals and have enacted laws that could effect major changes in the healthcare system  either nationally or at the state level 
driven in part by budget concerns  medicaid access and reimbursement restrictions have been implemented in some states and proposed in many others 
for example  in december  the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act mma was enacted to provide outpatient prescription drug coverage to senior citizens in the united states 
the company cannot predict the potential impact that this legislation will have on its business  however it could have a negative impact on the company s us pharmaceutical business as greater federal involvement and budget constraints may increase the likelihood of pricing pressures or controls in the future 
in many markets outside the united states  the company operates in environments of government mandated  cost containment programs 
most european countries  except the united kingdom and germany  do not provide market pricing for new medicines 
pricing freedom is limited in the united kingdom by the operation of a profit control plan and in germany by the operation of a reference price system 
companies also face significant delays in market access for new products  and more than two years can elapse before new medicines become available on some national markets 
the growth of managed care organizations mcos in the us has played a large role in the competition that surrounds the healthcare industry 
mcos seek to reduce healthcare expenditures for participants by making volume purchases and entering into long term contracts to negotiate discounts with various pharmaceutical providers 
because of the market potential created by the large pool of participants  marketing prescription drugs to mcos has become an important part of the company s strategy 
companies compete for inclusion in an mco formulary and the company has generally been successful in having its major products included 
pharmaceutical production processes are complex  highly regulated and vary widely from product to product 
shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures and regulatory approvals 
biologics manufacturing involves more complex processes than those of traditional pharmaceutical operations 
although the company does have the capacity to manufacture biologics for clinical trials and commercial launch  its current capacity to manufacture larger commercial volumes of these products is limited 
the company has maintained a competitive position in the market and strives to uphold this position  which is dependent on its success in discovering and developing innovative  cost effective products that serve unmet medical needs 
strategy the company is implementing a new strategy to discover and develop innovative  cost effective medicines that address significant unmet medical needs in ten critical disease areas 
these areas are affective psychiatric disorders  alzheimer s dementia  atherosclerosis thrombosis  diabetes  hepatitis  human immunodeficiency virus auto immune immunodeficiency virus hiv aids  obesity  oncology  rheumatoid arthritis and related diseases and solid organ transplant 
the company continuously strives to create better treatments for patients by building a high quality drug discovery and development pipeline 
since  the company has undergone a transition in its pharmaceutical product portfolio as older product lines  including the glucophage franchise  monopril  taxol and paraplatin  have experienced exclusivity loss 
with the successful launches of newer products including abilify for the treatment of psychiatric disorders  reyataz for human immunodeficiency virus hiv and erbitux for cancer  the portfolio is being refocused on growth brands which fall within the ten critical disease areas targeting specialists and high value primary care physicians 
sales of products within the ten disease areas have been increasing steadily  and are expected to comprise about half of pharmaceutical product sales by the end of the company is making significant investments behind its new product launches  and re deploying marketing and promotional spending from older products to its newer products 
in  the company submitted two new drug applications ndas to the us food and drug administration fda for regulatory approval  including entecavir for hepatitis b and muraglitazar for type diabetes 
a rolling biologics license application bla for abatacept for the potential treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is also expected to be completed in early the successful launch of these investigational compounds will further enhance the company s strategy to transition its product portfolio to cover all of the ten disease areas discussed above 
while internal growth is vital to the company s future success  the company is continually evaluating and pursuing external possibilities through alliances and other collaborative agreements 
the company has a notable record of executing successful 
table of contents licensing arrangements to supplement its own pipeline  and many of these arrangements have led to fruitful codevelopment  copromotion and comarketing agreements 
the company expects to continue to complement its pipeline in with additional licensed products 
another component of the company s strategy includes entry into the biologics business  which requires increased investments in manufacturing facilities and third party manufacturing arrangements to meet future commercial demand expected to be generated from new product launches 
in addition  the company continues to maintain collaborations with major biotechnology and research institutions to enhance the life cycle of the company s product portfolio beyond initial approval commercialization  such as offering combination therapy and product extensions 
another major aspect of the company s strategy relates to how it does business  specifically in marketing and sales approaches 
specialists are playing an even greater role in decisions related to patient treatment and care  particularly in the ten critical disease areas where the company is focusing its efforts 
for this reason  the company is recasting its business model to focus on specialists as well as with those primary care physicians who are involved in treating patients in these select disease areas 
in order to achieve its strategic objectives  the company also plans to moderate selling  general and administrative spending for the next several years  through the customer model noted above  as well as the elimination of organizational inefficiencies

when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership do not transfer  the company uses a consignment model to recognize the revenue 
under this model  the company does not recognize revenue upon shipment of product 
rather  upon shipment of product the company invoices the wholesaler  records deferred revenue at gross invoice sales price and classifies the inventory held by the wholesalers as consignment inventory at the company s cost of such inventory 
the company recognizes revenue net of the gross to net sales adjustments discussed below  all of which involve significant estimates and judgments when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer  which is not later than when such inventory is sold through to the wholesalers customers  on a first in  first out fifo basis
