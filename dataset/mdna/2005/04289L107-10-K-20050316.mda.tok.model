item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained in item of this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth under item business risk factors that may affect results and elsewhere in this report 
we were founded in december from through  we devoted our efforts principally to building  marketing and selling our professional services capabilities and to research and development activities related to our software products 
beginning in  we began to focus on selling our software products 
to date  we have enhanced and released several versions of our products 
on november   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of primus knowledge solutions  inc primus see note to the consolidated financial statements 
primus is a provider of software solutions that enable companies to deliver a superior customer experience via contact centers  information technology help desks  web intranet and internet self service and electronic communication channels 
the consolidated financial statements include primus financial results from the date of acquisition 
we market and sell our products worldwide through our direct sales force  systems integrators  technology alliances and original equipment manufacturers 
we derive our revenues from the sale of software product licenses and related services 
our software licenses are priced based on either the size of the customer implementation or site license terms 
services revenues are derived from fees for professional services  training and software maintenance and support 
professional services include implementation  custom application development and project and technical consulting 
we bill professional service fees primarily on a time and materials basis or in some cases  on a fixed price schedule defined specifically in our contracts 
software maintenance and support arrangements are priced based on the level of services provided 
generally  customers are entitled to receive software updates  maintenance releases as well as on line and telephone technical support for an annual maintenance fee 
training is billed as services are provided 
as of december  we had offices in the united states  united kingdom and northern ireland with sales personnel in france  italy  germany  and spain 
revenues from customers outside the united states accounted for of our total revenues in  in and in critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of 
table of contents contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  research and development costs  restructuring expenses  the impairment of long lived assets and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  known trends or events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
revenue recognition not only is revenue recognition a key component of our results of operations  the timing of our revenue recognition also determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions 
in measuring revenues  we follow the specific guidelines of statement of position sop no 
sop  software revenue recognition and sop sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
sop requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists via a signed license agreement  physical or electronic delivery has occurred including the availability of license keys or services rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable representing amounts that are due unconditionally with no future obligations under customary payment terms  and collectibility is probable 
in addition  revenue results are difficult to predict and any shortfall or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operational results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
in accordance with sop and sop  revenues from software product license agreements are recognized upon execution of a license agreement and delivery of the software  provided that the fee is fixed or determinable and deemed collectible by management 
if conditions for acceptance are required subsequent to delivery  revenues are recognized upon customer acceptance if such acceptance is not deemed to be perfunctory 
in multiple element arrangements  we use the residual value method in accordance with sop and sop revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements which qualify for separate element accounting treatment is allocated to each undelivered element using the relative fair values of those elements based on vendor specific objective evidence with the remaining value assigned to the delivered element  the software license 
typically our software licenses do not include significant post delivery obligations to be fulfilled by us and payments are due within a three month period from the date of delivery 
consequently  license fee revenue is generally recognized when the product is shipped 
revenues from software maintenance or hosting agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance or hosting period  which for application hosting and support and maintenance is typically one year 
customers who have purchased our product licenses and have also entered into a hosting agreement typically have a contractual right to cancel the hosting agreement with a minimum notice period 
we enter into reseller arrangements that typically provide for sublicense fees payable to us based upon a percentage of our list price 
revenues are recognized under reseller agreements as earned for guaranteed minimum royalties  or based upon actual sales to the resellers 
we do not grant our resellers the right of return or price protection 
revenues from professional service arrangements are recognized as the services are performed  provided that amounts due from customers are fixed or determinable and deemed collectible by management 
amounts collected prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are reflected as deferred revenue 
unbilled services represent service revenues that have been earned by us in advance of billings 
deferred revenue primarily consists of advance payments related to support and maintenance and service agreements 
we principally recognize professional services revenues on a time and material basis 
from time to time we enter into fixed price service arrangements 
in those circumstances in which services are essential to the functionality of the software  we apply the percentage of completion method  and in those situations when only professional services are provided  we apply the proportional performance method 
both of these methods 
table of contents require that we track the effort expended and the effort expected to complete a project 
the most significant assumption by management in accounting for this type of arrangement is the estimated time to complete the project 
significant deviations in actual results from management s estimates with respect to one or more projects could significantly impact the timing of revenue recognition and could result in significant losses on these projects 
to date  our actual results in completing projects have not deviated significantly from management s estimates of the time to complete those projects 
accounts receivable and bad debts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and determine the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical experience and specific customer collection issues 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
research and development costs we account for research and development costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  and sfas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  which specifies that costs incurred internally to develop computer software products should be charged to expense as incurred until technological feasibility is reached for the product 
once technological feasibility is reached  all software costs should be capitalized until the product is made available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility is established 
we believe that the time period from reaching technological feasibility until the time of general product release is very short 
costs incurred after technological feasibility is reached are not material  and accordingly  all such costs are charged to research and development expense as incurred 
restructuring expenses during   and  we recorded net restructuring charges benefits of million  million  million and million  respectively  pertaining to the closure and consolidation of excess facilities  impairment of assets as discussed below  employee severance benefits and settlement of certain contractual obligations 
these charges and benefits were recorded in accordance with sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  sfas  employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab  restructuring and impairment charges 
the and charges were recorded in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  sfas  and sab in determining the charges to record  we made certain estimates and judgments surrounding the amounts ultimately to be paid for the actions we have taken 
at december   there were various accruals recorded for the costs to terminate employees and exit certain facilities and lease obligations  which may be adjusted periodically for either resolution of certain contractual commitments or changes in estimates of severance payments  sublease income or the period of time the facilities will be vacant and subleased 
although we do not anticipate additional significant changes to our restructuring accruals  the actual costs may differ from those recorded in the event that the subleasing assumptions require adjustment due to changes in economic conditions surrounding the real estate market or we terminate our lease obligations prior to the scheduled termination dates 
such changes had a material impact to our operating results in the past and could have a material impact on our operating results in the future 
in order to estimate the costs related to our restructuring efforts  management made its best estimates of the most likely expected outcomes of the significant actions to accomplish the restructuring 
these estimates principally related to charges for excess facilities and included estimates of future sublease income  future net operating expenses of the facilities  brokerage commissions and other expenses 
the most significant of these estimates related to the timing and extent of future sublease income that would reduce our lease obligations 

table of contents included in our accrued restructuring balance at december  was estimated sublease income of million  net of adjustments 
we based our estimates of sublease income on  among other things  a opinions of independent real estate experts  b current market conditions and rental rates  c an assessment of the time period over which reasonable estimates could be made  d the status of negotiations with potential subtenants and e the locations of the facilities 
these estimates  together with other estimates made by us in connection with the restructuring actions  may vary significantly from the actual results  depending in part on factors beyond our control 
for example  the actual results will depend on our success in negotiating with lessors  the time periods required for us to locate and contract suitable subleases and the market rental rates at the time of such subleases 
adjustments to the facilities reserve may be required if actual lease settlement costs or sublease income differ from the amounts previously estimated 
we review the status of our restructuring activities on a quarterly basis and  if appropriate  record changes to our restructuring obligations in our financial statements for such quarter based on management s then current estimates 
additionally  we estimate the required severance accrual at foreign locations based on the minimum statutory requirements of each country 
the amount of severance that ultimately is paid may differ from the amount we have accrued 
in our history  we have not experienced significant variations between the amounts initially accrued for severance at foreign locations and the amounts ultimately paid out 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets  including intangible assets we review our long lived assets  including intangible assets subject to amortization  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if such assets are considered impaired  the impairment to be recognized is equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
in assessing recoverability  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and discount factors 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives  based upon the pattern in which the expected benefits will be realized  or on a straight line basis  whichever is greater 
as a result of our restructuring activities in  and  we evaluated the realizability of our long lived assets including fixed assets and leasehold improvements related to our restructured facility leases and intangible assets consisting primarily of unamortized goodwill 
in  and  we determined that   and million  respectively  of furniture and fixtures  computer equipment and software were impaired as a result of our decision to abandon the assets because of the termination of employees and related closures of offices in our  and restructuring plans 
these assets are no longer being used or will not be used in the future upon completion of the restructuring activities 
in addition  in  and we deemed   and  respectively  of leasehold improvements to be impaired due to exiting certain office locations  and the estimated sublease income was not sufficient to recover the assets carrying value 
in addition we determined that approximately  in of purchased software was impaired due to our revised product development strategy 
goodwill we account for goodwill under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires that goodwill not be amortized but instead tested for impairment annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events which may indicate that impairment has occurred 
the provisions of sfas no 
require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value  which is determined by use of a discounted cash flow technique  of the reporting entity to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting entity exceeds the carrying value of the net assets of that entity  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting entity exceeds the fair value of that entity  then we 
table of contents must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting entity s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting entity s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
determining the fair value of a reporting entity is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions may include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions  and determination of appropriate market comparables 
the estimates are based upon historical experience and projections of future activity  factoring in customer demand  changes in technology and a cost structure necessary to achieve the related revenues 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  we may make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values of reporting entities 
we plan on performing the annual impairment assessment as of december of each year 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we evaluate quarterly the realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
at december  and  we had provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of their realizability 
if substantial changes in our ownership have occurred or should occur  as defined by section of the internal revenue code  there could be annual limitations on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be realized in future periods 
in addition  we have provided for potential amounts due in various foreign tax jurisdictions 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
during and  we reversed previously accrued taxes of  and  respectively  for foreign locations  due to the closure of the statute of limitations  or as a result of changes in our estimates of potential amounts due  in those locations

primus contributed approximately of our revenues for we expect international revenues as a percentage of total revenues to remain at approximately 
total revenues decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to a shift in our business focus during from infrastructure products to application products  particularly in the e commerce and self service area

the decline in product license revenues in as compared to is attributable to reduced sales volume in terms of both the number and size of transactions with customers 
product license revenues generated from international customers decreased to million in from million in we expect product license revenues to increase in and to increase slightly as a percentage of total revenues 
product license revenues decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to a shift in our business focus during from infrastructure products to application products particularly in the e commerce and self service area

product license revenues as a percentage of total revenues for  and were  and  respectively 
we expect this percentage to be in the range of to in our resellers generally receive a discount from our list prices 
the extent of any discount is based on negotiated contractual agreements between us and the reseller 
we do not grant our resellers the right of return  price protection or favorable terms 
we rely upon resellers to market and sell our products to governmental entities and to customers in geographic regions where it is not cost effective for us to reach end users directly 
we have approximately active resellers 
reseller revenues and the percentage of revenues from resellers can vary significantly from period to period depending on the revenues from large deals  if any  closed through this channel during any period 
no resellers accounted for more than of our revenues for the years ended  or 
table of contents the table below sets forth product revenues recognized from reseller arrangements for the years ended  and reseller revenues percent of product license revenues services revenues services revenues increased to million in from million in the increase was attributable to increased professional services revenues due to improved utilization within atg and new services revenues from the acquisition of primus  offset by decreased support and maintenance revenues 
we expect services revenues to be higher in and to decrease slightly as a percentage of total revenues 
support and maintenance revenues were of total services revenues in as compared to in support and maintenance revenues  in absolute dollars  were lower during due to a combination of declining product revenues in prior periods and some customers electing to decrease or terminate their support coverage 
we expect support and maintenance revenues to increase in 
this is due to increases from new maintenance revenues associated with expected increased product revenues and the addition of primus active support and maintenance customer base  offset by a portion of existing customers terminating their support coverage 
services revenues decreased to million in from million in the decrease was attributable to decreased services volume associated with decreased software license revenues as well as a reduction in our services capacity as we reduced headcount in professional services 
support and maintenance revenues were of total services revenues in as compared to in support revenues  in absolute dollars  were slightly lower during due primarily to declining product revenues  partially offset by successful maintenance renewal and reinstatement efforts during services revenues as a percentage of total revenues for  and were  and  respectively

cost of product license revenues increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily related to amortization expense of  related to developed technology  an intangible asset recorded as part of the primus acquisition  offset by decreased salaries and related costs and decreased royalties paid on third party software embedded into our products and a non recurring impairment recorded in cost of product license revenues decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily related to lower product revenues and a decline in amortization of million related to the broadvision settlement due to the expiration of amortization as of december  in february  we settled a lawsuit filed by broadvision in december  which alleged that we were infringing on a patent for a method of conducting electronic commerce 
in connection with the settlement agreement  we agreed to pay broadvision a total of million for a perpetual license 
of this amount  we recognized million in in cost of product license revenues as a settlement for historical use of the technology  and we recorded the remaining million as a perpetual license to use the patented technology in our products in the future 
we amortized this asset over an estimated remaining useful life of three years 
as a result  cost of product license revenues includes amortization expense of approximately million in each of and the estimated useful life of the perpetual license ended on december   and we therefore did not

we anticipate the cost of product license revenues  as a percentage of total revenues  to be between and in gross margin on product license revenues for  and  gross margin on product license revenues was  or million   or million  and  or million  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin percentage in compared to is due to amortization expense of  related to developed technology from the primus acquisition 
the increase in gross margin percentage in compared to was attributed to the expiration of amortization related to the broadvision perpetual license  which was fully amortized by the end of cost of services revenues cost of services revenues includes salary and other related costs for our professional services and technical support staff  as well as third party contractor expenses 
cost of services revenues will vary significantly from year to year depending on the level of professional services staffing  the effective utilization rates of our professional services staff  the mix of services performed  including product license technical support services  the extent to which these services are performed by us or by third party contractors and the level of third party contractor fees 
cost of services revenues increased slightly to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in salaries and outside professional services costs  offset by reduced rent expense  operating costs and infrastructure expenses as a result of our restructuring efforts

gross margin has remained relatively flat in compared with the increase in gross margin in compared with was attributed primarily to the increase in support and maintenance revenue as a percentage of total services revenue  increased utilization rates and a decrease in our professional services workforce and operating expenses 
we expect gross margin on services revenues be relatively flat in and be in the to range 

table of contents research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and related costs to support product development 
to date  all software development costs have been expensed as research and development in the period incurred 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in our workforce and resulting decreases in salaries and related benefits and to a lesser extent  to reduced operating expenses as a result of our historical restructuring efforts 
the decrease was offset  in part  by an increase in the use of off shore developers 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in our workforce

we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase in  but will decrease  as compared with  as a percentage of total revenues 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and other related costs for sales and marketing personnel  travel  public relations and marketing materials and events 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease is primarily attributable to a reduction of our sales and marketing group  a reduction in our spending on marketing programs and a reduction in commissions from decreased product revenues 
compensation  commissions and benefits costs decreased by approximately  marketing and promotional expenses decreased by approximately million  with the remainder of the net decrease caused by a decrease in operating expenses resulting from our restructuring efforts  offset in part  by amortization of an intangible asset related to customer relationships from the primus acquisition of  sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease is primarily attributable to cost saving initiatives that resulted from a reduction of our sales and marketing group

for  and  sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues were  and  respectively 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase slightly in absolute dollars in  but will decrease  as compared with  as a percentage of total revenues 
however sales and marketing expenses can fluctuate as a percentage of total revenues depending on economic conditions  program spending  the rate at which new sales personnel become productive and the level of revenue 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for operations and finance employees and legal and accounting fees 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in approximately of the decrease was related to a decrease in our workforce  of the decrease was the result of lower hiring and training costs with the remainder related to decreases in rent expense and facilities related charges and other operating expenses resulting from our restructuring efforts and cost containment initiatives  offset by an increase in professional services comprising legal and accounting costs primarily due to compliance with the internal control requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of

restructuring benefit charges as of december   we had an accrued restructuring liability of million  of which million related to restructuring charges  million related to restructuring charges  million related to restructuring charges and million related to restructuring charges 
the long term portion of the accrued restructuring liability was million 
we believe our restructuring efforts have resulted in a cost structure that aligns us with current market opportunities and reflects changes in our product and geographic focus 
we expect to fund the payments for our restructuring accruals by use of our current cash and marketable securities and from resources generated from our future operations 
we do not believe that the restructuring actions have impaired our ability to produce competitive products in a timely fashion 
all of our restructuring actions were completed by december  we expect the activities to result in aggregate annual reductions in cost of revenues  sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses of million to million  which does not include any savings from staff reductions and facilities consolidation actions undertaken in connection with the primus acquisition see note to consolidated financial statements 
during the years ended   and we recorded net restructuring charges benefits of million  million  million and million  respectively  as a result of the global slowdown in information technology spending 
the significant drop in demand in for technology oriented products  particularly internet related technologies  caused management to significantly scale back our prior growth plans  resulting in a significant reduction in our workforce and consolidation of our facilities in throughout  the continued softness of demand for technology products  as well as near term revenue projections  caused management to further evaluate our marketing  sales and service resource capabilities as well as our overall general and administrative cost structure  which resulted in additional restructuring actions being taken in these actions resulted in a further reduction in headcount and consolidation of additional facilities 
in  as we continued to refine our business strategy and to consider future revenue opportunities  we took further restructuring actions to reduce costs  including product development costs  in order to help move us towards profitability 
in  our restructuring activities were undertaken to align our headcount more closely with management s revenue projections and changing staff requirements as a result of strategic product realignments and our acquisition of primus knowledge solutions  inc  and to eliminate facilities that were not needed in order to efficiently run our operations 
the charges referred to above primarily pertain to the closure and consolidation of excess facilities  impairment of assets  employee severance benefits  and the settlement of certain contractual obligations

the facilities related charges comprised of excess rental space for offices worldwide  net of estimates for vacancy periods and sublease income based on the then current real estate market data  and related write offs of abandoned leasehold improvements and fixed assets of million and million  respectively  which were directly related to excess office facilities 
the estimated sublease income was million and based on rental rates ranging from to per square foot with estimated vacancy periods prior to the expected sublease income ranging from to months 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an adjustment to increase the facility related costs for a change in estimate of the lease obligations for two leases by million as a result of a market analysis indicating lower sublease rates and longer vacancy periods due to the continued weakening of the real estate market 
the sublease income was adjusted by decreasing anticipated sublease rates from the range of to to the range of to per square foot and extending the initial vacancy periods by approximately months

rental assumptions or sublease start dates may vary considerably from the above assumptions  which could cause us to take an additional charge 
if the estimated sublease dates were to be extended by six months  based on our current estimates  we would potentially have to recognize an additional charge of  in our statement of operations for restructuring and other related charges

liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements relate primarily to facilities  employee infrastructure and working capital requirements 
historically  we have funded our cash requirements primarily through the public and private sales of equity securities  commercial credit facilities and operating and capital leases 
in the past  we also funded our cash requirements in part from operations 
at february   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities

the line of credit bore interest at the bank s prime rate 
effective december  the revolving line of credit increased to million 
the line of credit is secured by all of our tangible and intangible intellectual and personal property and is subject to financial covenants including liquidity coverage and profitability 
effective november   we modified our existing working capital facility with our bank 
the line of credit is secured by all of our tangible and intangible intellectual and personal property and is subject to financial covenants including liquidity coverage and profitability 
the liquidity covenant mandates we maintain million in unrestricted cash  which includes cash equivalents and marketable securities  at the end of each month throughout the duration of the facility 
on december  we entered into the seventh loan modification agreement the seventh amendment with the bank  which amended the amended and restated loan and security agreement dated as of june  under the seventh amendment  the profitability covenant was revised to allow for quarterly net losses not to exceed million for the fourth quarter of  million for the first quarter of   for the second quarter of  million for the third quarter of  and net profitability of at least for the fourth quarter of and for each quarter thereafter 
our ability to meet these profitability covenants may be affected by the adoption of sfas r  which we plan to adopt on july  see recent accounting pronouncements 
we are required to maintain unrestricted and unencumbered cash  which includes cash equivalents and marketable securities  at the end of each month as follows for the months ending january   february   april   and may   the greater of i million or ii two times the amount of outstanding obligations  which includes letters of credit  under the loan agreement  and for the months ending march  and june   and as of the last day of each month thereafter  million 
to avoid additional bank fees and expenses  we are required to maintain unrestricted cash  which includes cash equivalents and marketable securities  at the bank in an amount equal to two times the amount of obligations outstanding  which includes letters of credit that have been issued but not drawn upon  under the loan agreement 
in the event our cash balances at the bank fall below this amount  we will be required to pay fees and expenses to compensate the bank for lost income 
at december   we were in compliance with all related financial covenants 
in the event that we do not comply with any of the financial covenants within the line of credit or defaults on any of its provisions  the bank s significant remedies include declaring all obligations immediately due and payable  which could include requiring us to cash collateralize our outstanding letters of credit lc s  ceasing to advance money or extend credit for our 
table of contents benefit  applying to the obligations any balances and deposits held by us or any amount held by the bank owing to or for the credit of our account  and  putting a hold on any deposit account held as collateral 
if the agreement expires  is not extended  the bank will require outstanding lc s at that time to be cash secured on terms acceptable to the bank 
the revolving line of credit expires on december  while there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility at december   we had issued lc s totaling million  which are supported by this facility 
the lc s have been issued in favor of various landlords to secure obligations under our facility leases pursuant to leases expiring from december through january the line of credit bears interest at the bank s prime rate at december  
as of december   approximately million was available under the facility 
we lease our facilities and equipment under operating and capital leases that expire between and the aggregate minimum annual payments under these leases is million  which includes approximately million payable in of the million  million is for leases that are included in restructuring 
in accrued restructuring at december   the million was reduced to million after taking into consideration estimated operating costs  estimated sublease income  contracted sublease income  and vacancy periods 
of the million in lease payments  million is for facility leases and 
million is for equipment leases 
for additional information relating to our commercial and contractual commitments  see notes and to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k 
contractual obligations at december   our contractual cash obligations  which consist of operating and capital leases  were as follows in thousands payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years lease commitments we believe that there will not be any material real estate lease settlements beyond those completed to date 
as such  we believe that our balance of million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at december   along with other working capital and cash expected to be generated by our operations will allow us to meet our liquidity needs over the next twelve months 
however  our actual cash requirements will depend on many factors  including particularly  overall economic conditions both domestically and abroad 
we may seek additional external funds through public or private securities offerings  strategic alliances or other financing sources 
there can be no assurance that if we seek external funding  it will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
sfas r is effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  early application of sfas r is encouraged  but not required 
we plan to adopt sfas r on july  public companies are required to adopt the new standard using a modified prospective method and may elect to restate prior periods using the modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  companies are required to record compensation cost for new and modified awards over the related vesting period of such awards prospectively and record compensation cost prospectively for the unvested portion  at 
table of contents the date of adoption  of previously issued and outstanding awards over the remaining vesting period of such awards 
no change to prior periods presented is permitted under the modified prospective method 
under the modified retrospective method  companies record compensation costs for prior periods retroactively through restatement of such periods using the exact pro forma amounts disclosed in the companies footnotes 
also  in the period of adoption and after  companies record compensation cost based on the modified prospective method 
we have not yet determined the method of adoption we will use 
we have not completed our evaluation of the effects of adopting sfas r 
the adoption of sfas r could impact our ability to comply with the profitability covenants of our credit facility with our bank see note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of investment grade money market funds  corporate obligations and government obligations with a weighted average maturity of less than one year 
these held to maturity securities are subject to interest rate risk 
however  a change in interest rates would not have a material impact to the fair values of these securities primarily due to their short maturity and our intent to hold the securities to maturity 
there have been no significant changes since december  the majority of our operations are based in the us  and accordingly  the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
however  we have foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
our primary foreign currency exposures relate to our short term intercompany balances with our foreign subsidiaries 
the primary foreign subsidiaries have functional currencies denominated in the british pound  euro and australian dollar that are remeasured each reporting period with any exchange gains and losses recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 
based on currency exposures existing at december   a movement in foreign exchange rates would not expose us to significant gains or losses in earnings or cash flows 
we may use derivative instruments to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations  however  at december   there were no outstanding derivative instruments 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes
