sequenom  spectrochip  and massarray are registered trademarks of sequenom  inc overview we are a genetics company committed to providing the best genetic analysis products that translate genomic science into superior solutions for biomedical research and molecular medicine 
our proprietary massarray system is a high performance dna analysis platform that efficiently and precisely measures the amount of genetic target material and variations therein 
the system is able to deliver reliable and specific data from complex biological samples and from genetic target material that is available only in trace amounts 
we have used our massarray technology and our extensive collections of dna samples from diseased and healthy individuals to identify disease related genes that may predispose significant portions of the population to major diseases 
based on our discoveries  we have developed gene and diagnostic content for potential partner out licensing and commercial development opportunities 
we completed numerous scans of the human genome and identified over candidate genes indicating association with the following diseases breast cancer  lung cancer  prostrate cancer  melanoma  schizophrenia  type ii diabetes  obesity  dyslipidemia hdl cholesterol  hypertension  osteoarthritis and osteoporosis 
in most studies we have further analyzed our initial disease association findings in additional independent populations followed by appropriate biological confirmation experiments where feasible 
our goal is to leverage our superior technology to become a significant contributor in the development of molecular medicine  which encompasses applications often referred to as pharmacogenomics  personalized medicine  disease predisposition testing  cancer subtyping  and non invasive prenatal testing 
these fields share the need for analytical applications that define disease on a molecular level and with a high degree of reliability 
genetic analysis is primarily conducted in two key biomedical research market sectors the academic research market  where we currently focus  and the clinical analysis market  where we are expanding 
the research market makes initial genetic discoveries 
it is a relatively small market and is mainly comprised of academic institutions 
however  it is the source of discoveries of new genetic content 
the clinical analysis market is significantly larger and takes the genetic analysis a step further to establish the use of genes and genetic markers for the potential benefit of the general population 
the needs of these markets differ significantly 
the academic research market  which requires highest data density per sample  is more tolerant to inconsistencies in data and error rates  and typically has a shorter window of opportunity 
sample throughput is very high 
this academic research market is extremely price competitive 
the clinical analysis market is typically interested in a defined number of markers per sample  is not as tolerant to inconsistencies and error rates  typically has a longer development cycle  and is less price competitive 
sample throughput requirements are not nearly as high 
considering the clinical analysis market s requirements and the strengths of the massarray system  including its high sensitivity  specificity and reproducibility  we believe there is significant opportunity to be more competitive in the clinical analysis market 
we have targeted customers conducting quality genotyping and performing fine mapping studies  candidate gene studies  comparative sequencing and gene expression analysis in the molecular medicine market 
we support epigenetic analysis the analysis of dna methylation and genetic trace analysis applications the analysis of smallest amounts of genetic material in complex mixtures 
we also plan to broaden the markets to which we sell our product line 
we have identified four target segments for growth clinical research and clinical marker validation  the emerging field of molecular medicine  diagnostic service laboratories and animal testing laboratories 
as part of our focus on molecular diagnostics  we plan to develop analyte specific reagents asrs 
asrs are tests that measure biomarkers  which are intended for use in diagnostic application for identification and quantification of an individual substance in biological specimens 
in  sequenom plans to offer asrs for established genetic tests  such as tests for certain mendelian disorders 
as of december   our product revenues consisted of revenues from the sales of massarray hardware  software  consumables and maintenance agreements 
the impact of our massarray compact system and other new products and product applications on future revenues  margins  expenses  and cash flows remains uncertain and depends on many factors as described in item of this report under the caption risks and uncertainties related to our business 
we expect revenues from our out licensing efforts with respect to our disease gene discoveries to be minimal for the foreseeable future 
to the extent that revenues are realized  if at all  they may fluctuate significantly as revenues will be based upon out licensing of gene and target related intellectual property  the occurrence of certain milestones  and successful product development and commercialization  all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict 
as a result  our entitlement to  and the timing and amounts of  any licensing and milestone payments and royalty or revenue sharing payments on future diagnostic and therapeutic product sales are uncertain and difficult to predict 
to achieve such revenues we will likely be dependent upon the efforts  resources and success of present and potential licensees who will need to invest significant dollar amounts in research and development efforts  clinical trials  and obtaining regulatory approvals over several years 
since our inception  we have incurred significant losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to incur losses going forward at least until the end of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
certain of these accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to our investors understanding of our financial results and condition are discussed below 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
in preparing these financial statements  management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulleting sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and the further guidance in sab no 
 revenues are recognized  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we consider eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and for massarray system sales  the arrangement consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values determined by vendor specific objective evidence 
the separate units of accounting are typically the system and software itself and maintenance contracts sold at the time of the system sale 
revenue is deferred for fees received before earned 
revenues from sales of consumables are recognized generally upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer 
revenue from sales of massarray systems with standard payment terms of net days are recognized upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer or when all revenue recognition criteria are met 
our contracts do not contain refund or cancellation clauses 
revenues from the sale or licensing of our proprietary software are recognized over the duration of the software license or upon transfer of title to the customer 
we recognize revenue allocated to maintenance fees for ongoing customer support over the maintenance period 
revenues from snp validation services are recognized at the completion of key stages in the performance of the service  which is generally delivery of snp assay information 
grant revenue is recorded as the research expenses relating to the grants are incurred  provided that the amounts received are not refundable if the research is not successful 
amounts received that are refundable if the research is not successful would be recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue upon the grantor s acceptance of the success of the research results 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates are as follows accrued acquisition and integration costs 
to the extent that exact amounts were not determinable at the time of acquisition  we estimated amounts for direct costs of the acquisition of gemini genomics and axiom biotechnologies and the related integration costs in accordance with eitf  recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
and sfas no 
 business combinations 
amounts accrued relating to acquisition and integration costs totaled million and as of december  approximately million remained accrued 
the amount accrued at december  represents all remaining lease payments  net of estimated sublease income of million from existing subleased space 
if we do not receive all the amounts due to us under non cancelable subleases  we will incur additional expense 
impairment of long lived assets 
we periodically re evaluate the original assumptions and rationale utilized in the establishment of the carrying value and estimated lives of our long lived assets 
the criteria used for these evaluations include management s estimate of the asset s continuing ability to generate income from operations and positive cash flows in future periods as well as the strategic significance of any intangible assets in our business objectives 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets with a net book value of million were reviewed for impairment following the decision to close the internal drug discovery program in july as a result of this review  an impairment charge of million related to intangible assets acquired from axiom and other tangible assets which were determined to have no alternative future use was recorded 
the remaining million of assets were determined to not be impaired by this closure 
no impairment of long lived assets was recorded in a total impairment charge of million was recognized during the year ended december  intangible assets  primarily resulting from the acquisition of gemini genomics  totaled million  net of accumulated amortization  at december reserves for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
we operate in an industry characterized by rapid improvements and changes to our technology and products 
the introduction of new products by us or our competitors can result in our inventory being rendered obsolete or requiring us to sell items at a discount to cost 
we estimate the recoverability of our inventory by reference to our internal estimates of future demands and product life cycles 
if we incorrectly forecast demand for our products or inadequately manage the introduction of new product lines  we could materially impact our financial statements by having excess inventory on hand 
our future estimates are subjective and could be incorrect 
during  slow moving inventory reserves of million were charged to cost of goods sold  and the total reserve was million at december  new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb no 
 chapter  previously stated that under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs may be so abnormal to require treatment as a current period charges 
this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement will be effective for inventory costs during the fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas r 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas  statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt sfas r on july  as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future and the assumptions for the variables which impact the computation 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
results of operations years ended december   and overview revenues total revenues were million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
product revenues are derived from the sale of massarray systems  consumables including our proprietary spectrochip bioarray  sales and licensing of our proprietary software  maintenance contracts  and license fees from end users 
revenues for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  from the year ended december   primarily from a reduction in hardware sales from million in to million in  a reduction in sales of consumables from million to million  a reduction in software revenue of million  and a reduction in service revenues from million to million 
these decreases were partially offset by increases of million in maintenance income and million in research grant income 
consumable sales increased from million in to million in and declined to million in this reduction in consumables revenue from to was a result of a decline in our average selling prices and volumes for our spectrochip bioarray chips and other consumables 
our customers are increasing their multiplex testing levels on their samples  which in turn reduces the number of chips they consume 
competitive pressures have resulted in us lowering our consumables pricing to reduce the overall cost per genotype for our customers 
we expect average volumes of consumables per installed system to decline as more lower throughput compact systems are placed in use 
consumable sales increased from to as the installed base of massarray systems and the average value of consumables used by each system increased 
hardware sales revenue declined from million in to million in to million in during  the market for our high throughput systems became increasingly saturated 
we launched the compact system in the first quarter of  to address the larger market of customers with lower throughput requirements 
the sales cycle for the massarray compact system continues to be lengthy 
the lower price point for the massarray compact system has not resulted in a shorter sales cycle as we had originally expected  and resulted in lower revenue when compared to a similar number of high throughput systems sold 
we continue to develop our market for clinical genetics and molecular medicine where we believe the testing accuracy and broad dna analytical capabilities of our massarray system are well suited 
we expect compact system sales to increase during research revenue increased to million in compared to million in and million in we performed more work on our grants in as our largest collaborator began to transfer samples to us for investigation 
the timing of research revenues depends upon our expenditures on grant research and the receipt of the grant funding from the sponsoring agencies 
we expect grant revenue to decline in domestic and non us revenues were million and million  respectively  for the year ended december and million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  our distribution contract with one asia based distributor  representing million of revenue in  expired on december   although sales are continuing under the terms of that agreement until a new contract is negotiated 
we do not expect the expiry of this agreement to significantly reduce revenue in we expect revenue from present and future out licensing of our disease gene discoveries to be minimal for the foreseeable future 
we do not expect service revenue to be significant in the foreseeable future 
we expect that future revenues for our business will be affected by  among other things  massarray hardware and consumable demand  the acceptance by the market of our massarray compact system  customer budgets  new product and application introductions  competitive conditions and government research funding 
cost of product and service revenues and gross margins cost of product revenues were million  million and million and gross margins were  and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
during  higher margin consumables constituted of the mix of products sold  up from in  while lower margin hardware sales declined to in from in this change in product mix resulted in higher overall margins in as compared to  despite a reduction in margin on hardware sales in due to competitive price pressure 
gross margin was reduced by in due to an increase in the obsolescence reserve expense from million in to million in the decrease in the gross margin percentage for compared to resulted from a change in the overall mix of products sold in the product mix in included fewer massarray system hardware components but more higher margin consumable sales  offset by the phase out of old products as a result of new product offerings resulting in an obsolescence charge of million 
we believe that gross margin in future periods will be affected by  among other things  reductions in the selling price for systems and consumables  lower consumable sales per massarray system sold  the mix of products sold  competitive conditions  sales volumes  discounts offered  inventory reserves and obsolescence charges required and royalty payment obligations on in licensed technologies 
cost of service revenues were million  million and million  respectively  and gross margins were  and  respectively  for the years ended december    and gross margins are dependent on the particular service contract terms of the work undertaken in each year 
research and development costs research and development costs decreased to million from million and million in the years ended december    and  respectively 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  improvements to our existing products and validation of products under development  expenses relating to work performed under research contracts  and  prior to the termination of our internal drug discovery activities in july of  expenses related to our disease gene discovery and development programs 
the reduction in costs from to of million resulted from a reduction in operating supplies of million following completion of our genetic scans in and the closure of our disease gene discovery program in july  million in depreciation as assets reached the end of their useful life  and million in headcount related costs due to headcount reduction 
these decreases were offset by a reduction of million of absorption into cost of service contracts following the reduction in service contract volume in from the reduction in costs from to of million resulted from site consolidation following the gemini genomics acquisition in the fourth quarter of  lowering expenses by million  reduced headcount following cost reductions and the axiom acquisition in late lowering salary expenses by million  a million reduction in depreciation expense due to assets reaching the end of their useful lives  a reduction in laboratory supplies of million  lower collaboration and sample collection expenses of million following the completion of the majority of our sample collection activity and the reduction in laboratory headcount  reduced absorption of production costs into inventory of million as a result of lower service contract volume  an elimination of bonuses paid to senior management reducing costs by million  million reduction in travel costs and million of other general cost reduction 
we expect expenses in this area to decrease during as we realize the cost savings from the closure of our disease gene discovery program in july sales and marketing costs sales and marketing costs decreased by million to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   and from million in the year ended december  these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for sales and marketing  customer support  and business development personnel and their related department expenses 
the decrease in expense of million from to was primarily due to reduction in selling expenses in germany of million following a reduction in headcount in  reduced depreciation of million as assets were fully depreciated  reduced travel costs of million due to lower headcount  and reduced operating supplies of million 
these increases were offset by increased us headcount expenses of million and promotional expenses of million 
the decrease from to of million related to million from overseas headcount and site expenses following the closure of locations and elimination of headcount acquired during the mergers of axiom and gemini that were considered to be in excess of our current and future needs  lower promotion and printing expenses of million  and reduced us headcount expenses of million 
these increases were offset by an increase in other general expenses of million 
we expect headcount and associated expense to increase during as we strengthen our sales and field support operations 
general and administrative costs general and administrative costs decreased by million to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   and from million in the year ended december  these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for legal  finance and human resource personnel  and their related department expenses 
the decrease from to of million related to cost savings in legal fees of million due to reduced patent portfolio expenses  headcount reductions of million  a reduction in property and other taxes of million  and lower insurance costs due to reduced premiums of million 
these reductions were offset by an increase in building operating costs of million and other expenses of million 
the decrease from to of million related to cost savings in legal expenses of million  million from site reduction following the closure of locations and elimination of headcount acquired during the mergers that were considered to be in excess of our needs  other headcount reductions of million  a reduction in property and other taxes of million  lower communication and public relations costs of million  and an elimination of performance bonuses paid to senior management reducing costs by million 
these reductions were offset by an increase in insurance premiums of million 
the remaining reduction of million was a result of general administrative expense control 
restructuring charges and impairment of long lived assets and goodwill we terminated our internal drug discovery efforts during the third quarter of  which reduced our headcount by approximately by the end of compared to our headcount prior to the restructuring 
we will continue with our out licensing program to seek to capitalize on the value of our disease gene discoveries for potential diagnostic and therapeutic product development and certain other programs are continuing within our ongoing research and development activities 
during  we incurred total charges of million related to the closure of these activities 
we expect to incur no further costs with respect to this closure 
of the million charge  million relates to non cash charges from the write off of million on equipment taken out of service and million of intangible assets of no value to our ongoing business and million relates to employee severance costs and other contractual obligations which have all been paid as of year end 
the impairment of assets and goodwill charge of million in the year ended december  consisted of two elements 
following the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets we performed the annual test for impairment of goodwill at october  as a result of this test  we recognized a non cash charge of million to write off all the remaining goodwill arising from the acquisitions of gemini genomics and axiom biotechnologies 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we examine our tangible and intangible assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the long lived asset might not be recoverable 
as a result of this examination  we determined that long lived assets with a carrying amount of million were impaired and wrote them down to their estimated fair value of million 
fair value was based on discounted expected future cash flows to be generated by these assets 
these assets included licensed intellectual property  prepayments  software acquired as part of the gemini genomics acquisition  and fixed assets 
an impairment charge of million was accordingly recorded in the fourth quarter of for these assets 
in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of axiom biotechnologies in  we recorded a non cash in process research and development charge of million 
this amount represented the value of the research and development projects acquired from axiom biotechnologies that had not reached technological feasibility and did not have alternative future uses as of the date of acquisition 
integration costs the million integration charge in related to our decision to close our uppsala  sweden facility that we acquired in the amount consisted primarily of book value of the assets at time of closure 
we do not anticipate any additional charges related to the closure of this facility 
amortization of acquired intangibles in connection with the acquisition of gemini genomics  we acquired approximately million of intangible assets  including clinical data collections and patent rights 
in connection with the acquisition of axiom biotechnologies  we acquired approximately million of intangible assets  including patent rights  human cell banks  and assay technology 
these intangible assets will be amortized over three to five years 
the amortization charge of million represents the amortization of all these assets held throughout the year  and the reduction in expense of million from is due to an impairment of intangible assets of million related to the axiom acquisition following the closure of our gene discovery program and an adjustment to the carrying value of assets related to the gemini acquisition of million 
the amortization of million represents the amortization of all these assets held throughout the year 
the reduction in the amortization charge of million from to primarily relates to the loss of access to clinical data collections following the closure of our uppsala  sweden facility 
the amortization of million represents the amortization of the gemini genomics intangible assets throughout the year and the amortization of the axiom biotechnologies intangible assets from the date of acquisition 
interest income interest income was million in  compared to million in  and million in the decrease from to and from to resulted from lower interest rates and lower average balances of interest bearing investments 
interest expense interest expense was million in  compared to million in  and million in the decrease from to resulted from our lower level of borrowings in as we pay off our capital leases 
the increase from to is from the increase in the amount of debt outstanding during those years 
interest expense in all years resulted primarily from interest payments under our capital lease obligations and long term debt 
deferred income tax benefit the deferred tax benefit of million  million and million in  and  respectively  is due to the amortization on the intangible assets  including clinical data collections and patent rights  acquired from gemini genomics 
cumulative effect of accounting change effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 which requires that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life will no longer be amortized but will be reviewed for impairment upon adoption of sfas no 
and annually thereafter 
we recognized a non cash charge of million to reduce the carrying value of our goodwill in the charge is non operational in nature and is reflected as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the consolidated statement of operations 
income taxes as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we recognize tax assets on the balance sheet if it is more likely than not that they will be realized on future tax returns 
at december   we have provided a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of million  reflecting uncertainties associated with future profitability 
at december   we have federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the difference between the federal and state tax loss carryforwards is attributable to the capitalization of research and development expenses for state tax purposes and the limitation on the california loss carryforwards 
the federal tax loss carryforwards will begin to expire in  unless previously utilized 
approximately million of the state tax loss carryforwards will expire in and the state tax loss carry forwards will continue to expire in unless previously utilized 
we incurred a federal and state capital loss on the disposal of two of our foreign subsidiaries in totaling million 
the capital loss carryforward will expire in we also have german and united kingdom uk net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which may be carried forward indefinitely 
approximately million of the uk net operating loss carry forwards was acquired with the purchase of gemini genomics and is fully reserved by the valuation allowance 
to the extent these uk net operating loss carryforwards are utilized  such benefit will be recorded as a purchase accounting adjustment 
the deferred tax asset includes a future tax benefit of approximately million related to stock option deductions  which  if recognized  will be allocated to additional paid in capital 
we also have federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal research and development tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in unless previously utilized 
pursuant to internal revenue code sections and  use of our federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited due to a cumulative change in ownership of more than within a three year period 
use of our uk net operating loss carryforwards may be limited upon the occurrence of certain events such as the discontinuation or change in the nature or conduct of the business 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash totaled million  compared to million at december  our cash reserves are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including investment grade corporate bonds  commercial paper and money market accounts 
short term we consider the material drivers of our cash flow to be sales volumes  inventory management and operating expenses 
our principal sources of liquidity are our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
cash used in operations for year ended december  was million compared to million for the use of cash was a result of the net loss of million for year ended december   adjusted for non cash depreciation and amortization of million  million of deferred income tax benefit and reductions in accounts receivable balances of million due to lower sales activity and reduced time taken to collect receivables  reductions of million in inventory levels from inventory management and valuation reserves  increases in other liabilities of million  and reductions in accounts payable and deferred income of million 
at our current and anticipated level of operating loss  we expect to incur an operating cash outflow on a quarterly basis 
we anticipate that this will continue in the future as we continue to invest in new product research and development  regulatory approval  and sales  marketing and support activities 
as a result  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable security balances will decline 
if the current trend of cash use continues  we will need additional capital to support our activities  as described in our discussion under the heading long term below 
investing activities  other than the changes in our short term investments and restricted cash  used million in cash during due to leasehold improvements and purchases of additional laboratory equipment 
net cash used by financing activities was million for year ended december  compared to million used by financing activities in financing activities during included net payments of million for long term debt and capital leases and the receipt of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan purchases of million 
long term when we require additional funds  general market conditions or the then current market price of our common stock may not support capital raising transactions such as an additional public or private offering of our common stock or other securities 
if additional funds are required and we are unable to obtain them on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us  we may be required to cease or reduce further commercialization of our products  to cease or reduce certain research and development projects  to sell some or all of our technology or assets or business units or to merge all or a portion of our business with another entity 
if we raise additional funds by selling shares of our capital stock  the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted 
the following table summarized our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years after years open purchase orders long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual obligations future operating lease commitments for leases have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals to be received through december aggregating million 
open purchase orders are primarily for inventory items and research and development supplies 
other commitments and contingencies that may result in contractual obligations to pay are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
based on our current plans  we believe our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  debt obligations and capital requirements at least through however  the actual amount of funds that we will need will be determined by many factors  some of which are beyond our control  and we may need funds sooner than currently anticipated 
these factors include but are not limited to the size of our future operating losses  the level of our success in selling our massarray products and services  our ability to introduce and sell new products and services  and successfully reduce inventory levels of earlier products  the level of our selling  general and administrative expenses  our success in and the expenses associated with researching and developing diagnostic and therapeutic products  alone or in collaboration with our partners  and obtaining any required regulatory approval for those products  the extent of our research and development pursuits  including our level of investment in massarray product research and development  achieving good manufacturing practice certification  and asr research and development  the extent to which we enter into  maintain  and derive revenues from licensing agreements  including agreements to out license our disease gene discoveries  research and other collaborations  joint ventures and other business arrangements  the extent to which we acquire  and our success in integrating  technologies or companies  the extent to which parties may seek to re use our consumable chips  the level of our legal expenses including those expenses associated with litigation and with intellectual property protection  and regulatory changes and technological developments in our markets 
we have a million bank line of credit provided by the union bank of california  of which million is available for borrowing and expires on march  at september   we were in breach of one of the covenants of this loan requiring us to have in excess of million of unrestricted cash and short term investments 
we remedied the breach by providing the lender with a letter of credit for million 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants 
the line of credit agreement requires us to comply with various financial and restrictive covenants 
financial covenants include requirements that we maintain certain levels of unrestricted cash and net tangible asset balances 
we have no commitments for any additional financings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk short term investments the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the fair value of the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities rated bbb or above by standard poors 
our investment policy includes a minimum quality rating for all new investments 
if an investment we hold falls below this level  we research the reasons for the fall and determine if we should continue to hold the investment in order to minimize our exposure to market risk of the investment 
we have not experienced any significant losses in our investment portfolio as a result of rating changes 
the average duration of all of our investments has generally been less than one year 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosure is provided 
foreign currency rate fluctuations we have foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the great british pound gbp and the euro eur 
the subsidiaries accounts are translated from the relevant functional currency to the us dollar using the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date  for balance sheet accounts  and using the average exchange rate during the period for revenues and expense accounts 
the effects of translation are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
our subsidiaries conduct their business with customers in local currencies 
exchange gains and losses arising from these transactions are recorded using the actual exchange differences on the date of the transaction 
we have not taken any action to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  such as options or futures contracts  with respect to transactions with our subsidiaries or transactions with our customers where the invoicing currency is not the us dollar
