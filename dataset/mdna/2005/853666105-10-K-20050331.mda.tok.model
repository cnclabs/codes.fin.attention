item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations and the financial condition of our business during each of the fiscal years in the three year period ended december  overview we are a leading independent manufacturer and distributor of replacement parts for motor vehicles in the automotive aftermarket industry 
we are organized into two major operating segments  each of which focuses on a specific segment of replacement parts 
our engine management segment manufactures ignition and emission parts  on board computers  ignition wires  battery cables and fuel system parts 
our temperature control segment manufactures and remanufactures air conditioning compressors  and other air conditioning and heating parts 
we sell our products primarily in the united states  canada and latin america 
we also sell our products in europe through our european segment 
as part of our efforts to grow our business  as well as to achieve increased production and distribution efficiencies  on june  we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the operating liabilities of dana corporation s engine management group subsequently referred to as dem 
prior to the sale  dem was a leading manufacturer of aftermarket parts in the automotive industry focused exclusively on engine management 
our plan is to restructure and to integrate the dem business into our existing engine management business 
under the terms of the acquisition  we paid dana corporation million in cash  issued an unsecured promissory note of million  and issued  shares of our common stock valued at million 
including transaction costs  our total purchase price was approximately million 
in connection with the acquisition  we have reviewed our operations and implemented integration plans to restructure the operations of dem 
as part of the integration and restructuring plans  we closed seven of the nine acquired dem facilities  and we estimated total restructuring costs of million 
such amounts were recognized as liabilities assumed in the acquisition and included in the allocation of the cost to acquire dem 
based on our most recent estimates of the total restructuring costs  approximately million relates to work force reductions and employee termination benefits 
this amount primarily represents severance costs relating to the involuntary termination of dem employees individually employed throughout dem facilities across a broad range of functions  including managerial  professional  clerical  manufacturing and factory positions 
termination benefits of million and million have been paid in and  respectively 
the restructuring costs also include approximately million associated with exiting certain activities  primarily related to lease and contract termination costs 
exit costs of million were paid in leaving the exit reserve balance at million as of december  the dem acquisition in was strategic and continues to be our primary focus in the critical goals we established for a successful integration were to maintain the dem customer base  reduce excess capacity by closing seven of the acquired facilities in a to month timeframe  and complete the transition for million of cash outlays in restructuring and integration costs during this same period 
the integration has proceeded on schedule  and all dem operations including manufacturing  distribution  mis  finance  sales and marketing have been transferred to smp locations 
as planned  we have exited seven of the acquired nine facilities  and this has been accomplished within our original time frame of twelve to eighteen months 
the integration moves have been completed within budget  and thus far we have maintained all the dem customers 
based on our current expectations  we continue to believe that as we achieve the planned material product cost savings  and our new employees achieve normal efficiency  we will accomplish our target of million annual savings from the dem acquisition 
it is our goal to begin approaching this number during the second half of on february   we acquired inventory from the canadian distribution operation of dem for approximately million 
we have relocated such inventory into our distribution facility in mississauga  canada 
for additional information about our business  strategy and competitive environment  refer to item  business 
seasonality 
historically  our operating results have fluctuated by quarter  with the greatest sales occurring in the second and third quarters of the year and revenues generally being recognized at the time of shipment 
it is in these quarters that demand for our products is typically the highest  specifically in the temperature control segment of our business 
in addition to this seasonality  the demand for our temperature control products during the second and third quarters of the year may vary significantly with the summer weather 
for example  a cool summer may lessen the demand for our temperature control products  while a hot summer may increase such demand 
as a result of this seasonality and variability in demand of our temperature control products  our working capital requirements peak near the end of the second quarter  as the inventory build up of air conditioning products is converted to sales and payments on the receivables associated with such sales have yet to be received 
during this period  our working capital requirements are typically funded by borrowing from our revolving credit facility 
the seasonality of our business offers significant operational challenges in our manufacturing and distribution functions 
to limit these challenges and to provide a rapid turnaround time of customer orders  we traditionally offer a pre season selling program  known as our spring promotion  in which customers are offered a choice of a price discount or longer payment terms 
inventory management 
we face inventory management issues as a result of warranty and overstock returns 
many of our products carry a warranty ranging from a day limited warranty to a lifetime limited warranty  which generally covers defects in materials or workmanship and failure to meet industry published specifications 
in addition to warranty returns  we also permit our customers to return products to us within customer specific limits in the event that they have overstocked their inventories 
in particular  the seasonality of our temperature control segment requires that we increase our inventory during the winter season in preparation of the summer selling season and customers purchasing such inventory have the right to make returns 
in order to better control warranty and overstock return levels  beginning in we tightened the rules for authorized warranty returns  placed further restrictions on the amounts customers can return and instituted a program so that our management can better estimate potential future product returns 
in addition  with respect to our air conditioning compressors  our most significant customer product warranty returns  we established procedures whereby a warranty will be voided if a customer does not follow a twelve step warranty return process 
comparison of fiscal years and sales 
on a consolidated basis  net sales for were million  an increase of million  or  compared to million in the increase in net sales was primarily in our engine management segment and our canadian distribution business 
engine management net sales increased to million an increase of million or in as compared to the acquisition of dem added approximately million of incremental net sales in the first half of with no sales in the comparable period in excluding the impact of the first half dem net sales  the balance of engine management sales increased million or 
the million increase in sales in our canadian business was related to the acquisition of the dem distribution business in february temperature control net sales decreased to million a decrease of million or in as compared to the decrease in temperature control net sales was primarily due to the very cool and wet weather conditions existing in the spring and early summer 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we determined that it was a preferable accounting method to reflect new customer acquisition costs as a reduction to revenue when incurred instead of as we initially recorded it as a prepaid asset and the related expense which was recognized ratably over a month period as an offset to sales 
accordingly  we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting for new customer acquisition costs totaling million or million  net of tax effects and recorded the accounting change as if it had taken effect on october  gross margins 
gross margins as a percentage of consolidated net sales  decreased to in compared to in the margin decrease was primarily related to a number of significant one time related items from the final dem integration and lower net sales in our temperature control segment 
the engine management gross margins were negatively impacted in the fourth quarter of primarily related to the underabsorption of factory overhead expenses of approximately million due to closing manufacturing facilities for physical inventories and to reduce the bridge inventories which had been built to cover the plant closings  unfavorable physical inventory adjustments of approximately million primarily related to the scrapping of inventories in facilities being closed  and an inventory writedown of approximately million related to the inventory turnover for products sourced on the outside at substantial premiums to our manufactured costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased by million to million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily due to the million sales increase  as discussed above  and an increase of million in discount fees associated with the sale of customer receivables see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in we anticipate further savings in as we have completed the dem integration and merged operations 
goodwill 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized  but instead  is subject to an annual review for potential impairment 
our annual impairment test of goodwill as of december   indicated that the carrying amounts of two of our reporting units exceeded the corresponding fair values  which were determined based on the discounted estimated future cash flows of the reporting units  the companies weighted average cost of capital and market multiples 
as a result  we recorded an impairment loss on goodwill of million during the fourth quarter of the impairment loss related to our temperature control and european operation segment for which we recorded a charge of million and million  respectively 
we will continue to test for impairment of our goodwill at least annually in the future 
integration expenses 
integration expenses in were million  primarily related to the dem integration  compared to million in  which primarily related to expenses associated with the dem integration and with the divestiture of a product line within our european segment 
operating income loss 
operating income decreased by million to an operating loss of million in  compared to operating income of million in the decrease was primarily due to fourth quarter charges impacting the engine management gross margin  lower temperature control sales  goodwill impairment charge and dem integration expenses 
other income  net 
other income  net  increased to million in compared to an expense of million in the increase was primarily due to increased earnings from joint ventures and foreign exchange transactions 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million to million in compared to million in income tax provision 
the effective tax rate for continuing operations decreased from in to in the effective rate was impacted by various tax jurisdictions we do business in and no tax benefits recorded on losses in europe 
loss from discontinued operation 
loss from discontinued operation  net of taxes  in reflects million associated with asbestos related provisions and legal expenses as compared to million of legal expenses in as discussed more fully in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we are responsible for certain future liabilities relating to alleged exposure to asbestos containing products 
cumulative effect of accounting change 
as discussed above  we reflect new customer acquisition costs as a reduction to revenue when incurred 
we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting for new customer acquisition costs totaling million or million  net of tax effects and recorded the amount as if the change in accounting principle had taken effect on october  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion 
comparison of fiscal years and sales 
on a consolidated basis  net sales for were million  an increase of million  or  compared to million in excluding dem net sales of million  engine management net sales were down million during compared to the volume decline was in line with our forecasts  and would have been mitigated if we had implemented normal price level increases in  which have been implemented in the temperature control net sales decrease of million was primarily due to the loss of business with autozone and the very cool and wet weather conditions existing in the spring and early summer 
gross margins 
gross margins  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  decreased to in  from in a combination of lower margins from dem and the loss in business in temperature control noted above  negatively effected gross margins during the period 
as dem is integrated  we do expect gross margins to improve as a result of operating efficiencies achieved in overhead absorption and material costs reductions 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased million to million in  compared to million in excluding dem sg a expenses of million  sg a expenses decreased million in versus during we incurred approximately million of integration and restructuring expenses of which million related to dem and the remaining balance relating to our temperature control and european segments compared to million of restructuring expenses in reducing dem sg a expenses is a major focus during the dem integration and sg a is expected to significantly decrease 
goodwill 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized  but instead  is subject to an annual review for potential impairment 
we completed our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of and determined that our goodwill was not impaired 
during the first quarter of  we performed our initial impairment test of goodwill reviewing the fair values of each of our reporting units using the discounted cash flows method  based on our weighted average cost of capital and market multiples 
the decline in economic and market conditions  higher integration costs than anticipated and the general softness in the automotive aftermarket caused a decrease in the fair values of certain of our reporting units 
as a result  we recorded an impairment loss on goodwill as a cumulative effect of accounting change of million  net of tax  or per diluted share during the first quarter of the impairment loss relates to goodwill of million in our european segment and million in our temperature control segment 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of we wrote off approximately million for the impairment of goodwill associated with the engine management reporting unit of our european segment 
operating income 
operating income decreased by million to million in  compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to the overall decrease in consolidated net sales  excluding dem net sales  as discussed above and the acquisition of dem 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  decreased million primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange losses and lower interest and dividend income 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million in  compared to  due to lower interest rates 
income tax provision 
the effective tax rate for continuing operations was in and in the increase was primarily due to lower earnings in our domestic operations as compared to and operating losses in our european segment for which no income tax benefit has been recorded 
our foreign income tax relates primarily to our profitable canadian and hong kong operations 
loss from discontinued operation 
loss from discontinued operation in reflects million associated with asbestos related legal expenses 
in  the million charge included a reserve for future indemnification and legal expenses 
as discussed more fully in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we are responsible for certain future liabilities relating to alleged exposure to asbestos containing products 
based on the information contained in the september actuarial study  which estimated an undiscounted liability for settlement payments ranging from million to million  and all other available information considered by us  we recorded an after tax charge of million as a loss from discontinued operation during the third quarter of to reflect such liability  excluding legal costs 
we concluded that no amount within the range of settlement payments was more likely than any other and  therefore  recorded the low end of the range as the liability associated with future settlement payments through in our consolidated financial statements  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
impact of inflation although inflation is a concern  management believes it will be able to continue to minimize any adverse effect of inflation on earnings through cost reduction programs  including the sale of manufactured products  and  where competitive situations permit  selling price increases 
recently  prices of steel and other commodities have risen 
these increases did not have a material impact on our consolidated results  as we are not dependent on any single commodity  however  there can be no assurance over the long term that increases in commodity prices will materially effect our business or results of operations 
future results of operations we continue to face competitive pressures 
in order to sell at competitive prices while maintaining profit margins  we are continuing to focus on overhead and cost reductions 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
during the year ended december   cash provided by operations amounted to million  compared to million in and million in the reduction in was primarily attributable to lower earnings from continuing operations and restructuring charges incurred offset by a decrease in accounts receivable 
the decrease in accounts receivable is primarily the result of certain of our significant customers implementing negotiable draft programs  whereby cash collections of accounts receivable balances can be made early at our option  but at a discount to us 
the cost of such discounts is recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the reduction in was primarily attributable to lower earnings from continuing operations  a decrease in accounts payable and a lower decrease in inventory in  as compared to for the year ended december   inventory increased by approximately million 
inventory turnover was x in  x in  and x in inventory turnover should improve as dem is integrated  and inventory build ups needed to ensure order fulfillment are reduced as dem is effectively integrated 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million in and million in the decrease is primarily due to the payment for the acquisition of dem on june  during  payments for acquisitions include dem in canada and the final cash payment for the dem acquisition 
the increase during as compared to was primarily due to the acquisition of dem as discussed more fully in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
assets acquired consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  receivables and inventory 
all acquisitions were financed with funds provided from our secondary equity offering  revolving credit facility and seller financing 
in january  we acquired the assets of a temperature control business from hartle industries for million 
the assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  and inventory 
in april  we acquired carol cable limited  a manufacturer and distributor of wire sets based in the united kingdom  for approximately million 
the assets from this acquisition consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  and inventory 
in addition  during  the company paid approximately an additional million for the remaining equity interest in smp holdings limited 
in may  we purchased the aftermarket fuel injector business of sagem inc  a subsidiary of johnson controls  for million 
sagem inc is a basic manufacturer of fuel injectors and was our primary supplier prior to the acquisition 
assets acquired from this acquisition consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  and inventory 
the purchase was partially financed by the seller million to be paid over a two year period  with the remaining funds being provided under our revolving credit facility 
capital expenditures for the three most recent fiscal years ended december totaled million in  million in  and million in financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  and million in compared to cash used in financing activities of million in the decrease is primarily due to the financing related to the acquisition of dem on june  effective april   we entered into an agreement with general electric capital corporation  as agent  and a syndicate of lenders for a secured revolving credit facility 
the term of the credit agreement was for a period of five years and provided for a line of credit up to million 
effective june   in connection with our acquisition of dem  we amended and restated our credit agreement to provide for an additional million commitment 
this additional commitment increases the total amount available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility to million from million  and extends the term of the credit agreement from to availability under our revolving credit facility is based on a formula of eligible accounts receivable  eligible inventory and eligible fixed assets  which includes the purchased assets of dem 
we expect such availability under the revolving credit facility to be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating and integration costs 
our credit agreement also permits dividends and distributions by us provided specific conditions are met 
direct borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at the prime rate plus the applicable margin as defined in the credit agreement or the libor rate plus the applicable margin as defined in the credit agreement  at our option 
borrowings are collateralized by substantially all of our assets  including accounts receivable  inventory and fixed assets  and those of our domestic and canadian subsidiaries 
the terms of our revolving credit facility provide for  among other provisions  new financial covenants requiring us  on a consolidated basis  to maintain specified levels of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda as defined in the amendments to the credit agreement  at the end of each fiscal quarter through december   commencing september   to maintain specified levels of fixed charge coverage at the end of each fiscal quarter rolling twelve months through  and to limit capital expenditure levels for each fiscal year through we subsequently received a waiver of compliance with the ebitda covenant for the fiscal quarters ending september  and december  at december   we were not in compliance with the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio contained in our revolving credit facility 
however  as of march   we received a waiver of compliance of such covenant for the quarter ended on december  the waiver was part of an amendment to our revolving credit facility  which provided  among other things  for the following borrowings of the company are no longer collateralized by the assets  including accounts receivable  inventory and fixed assets  of our canadian subsidiary  the specified levels of fixed charge coverage has been modified for and thereafter  our canadian subsidiary was released from its obligations under a guaranty and security agreement  and the company s pledge of stock of its canadian subsidiary to the lenders was reduced from a to a pledge of stock 
in addition  in order to facilitate the aggregate financing of the dem acquisition  we completed a public equity offering of  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately million and also issued to dana corporation  shares of our common stock valued at approximately million 
in connection with our acquisition of dem  on june  we also issued to dana corporation an unsecured subordinated promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of approximately million 
the promissory note bears an interest rate of per annum for the first year  with such interest rate increasing by one half of a percentage point on each anniversary of the date of issuance 
accrued and unpaid interest is due quarterly under the promissory note 
the maturity date of the promissory note is december  the promissory note may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time without penalty 
on june   we borrowed million under a mortgage loan agreement 
the loan is payable in equal monthly installments 
the loan bears interest at a fixed rate of maturing in july the mortgage loan is secured by the related building and property 
our profitability and working capital requirements are seasonal due to the sales mix of temperature control products 
our working capital requirements usually peak near the end of the second quarter  as the inventory build up of air conditioning products is converted to sales and payments on the receivables associated with such sales begin to be received 
our working capital is further being impacted by restructuring and integration costs  as well as inventory build ups necessary to ensure order fulfillment during the dem integration 
these increased working capital requirements are funded by borrowings from our lines of credit 
in  we also received the benefit from accelerating accounts receivable collections from customer draft programs 
while this program is new in  we cannot ensure such programs will remain going forward 
we anticipate that our present sources of funds will continue to be adequate to meet our near term needs 
in october  we entered into a new interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million that is to mature in october under this agreement  we receive a floating rate based on the libor interest rate  and pay a fixed rate of on the notional amount of million 
on july   we issued convertible debentures  payable semi annually  in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the debentures carry an interest rate of  payable semi annually 
the debentures are convertible into  shares of our common stock  and mature on july  the proceeds from the sale of the debentures were used to prepay an senior note  reduce short term bank borrowings and repurchase a portion of our common stock 
during through  the board of directors authorized multiple repurchase programs under which we could repurchase shares of our common stock 
during such years  million in the aggregate of common stock was repurchased to meet present and future requirements of our stock option programs and to fund our employee stock option plan esop 
as of december   we have board authorization to repurchase additional shares at a maximum cost of million 
during  and  we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock 
the following is a summary of our contractual commitments  inclusive of our acquisition of dem  as of december  in thousands thereafter total principal payments of long term debt   operating leases        interest rate swap agreements post employee retirement funding        severance payments related to integration   total commitments        critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
you should be aware that preparation of our consolidated annual and quarterly financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we can give no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue primarily from sales of replacement parts for motor vehicles from both our engine management and temperature control segments 
we recognize revenues when products are shipped and title has been transferred to a customer  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
we estimate and record provisions for cash discounts  quantity rebates  sales returns and warranties in the period the sale is recorded  based upon our prior experience and current trends 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in estimating sales returns and allowances relating to revenue recognized in any accounting period 
inventory valuation 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is generally determined on the first in  first out basis 
where appropriate  standard cost systems are utilized for purposes of determining cost  the standards are adjusted as necessary to ensure they approximate actual costs 
estimates of lower of cost or market value of inventory are determined at the reporting unit level and are based upon the inventory at that location taken as a whole 
these estimates are based upon current economic conditions  historical sales quantities and patterns and  in some cases  the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories 
we also evaluate inventories on a regular basis to identify inventory on hand that may be obsolete or in excess of current and future projected market demand 
for inventory deemed to be obsolete  we provide a reserve on the full value of the inventory 
inventory that is in excess of current and projected use is reduced by an allowance to a level that approximates our estimate of future demand 
sales returns and other allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts 
the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  our management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
at december   the allowance for sales returns was million 
similarly  our management must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
at december   the allowance for doubtful accounts and for discounts was million 
cumulative effect of change in accounting for new customer acquisition costs 
new customer acquisition costs refer to arrangements pursuant to which we incur change over costs to induce a new customer to switch from a competitor s brand 
in addition  change over costs include the costs related to removing the new customer s inventory and replacing it with standard motor products inventory commonly referred to as a stocklift 
new customer acquisition costs were initially recorded as a prepaid asset and the related expense was recognized ratably over a month period beginning in the month following the stocklift as an offset to sales 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that it was a preferable accounting method to reflect the customer acquisition costs as a reduction to revenue when incurred 
we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting for new customer acquisition costs totaling million or million  net of tax effects and recorded the amount as if the change in accounting principle had taken effect on october  accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
at december   we had a valuation allowance of million  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review  include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
with respect to goodwill  if necessary  we test for potential impairment in the fourth quarter of each year as part of our annual budgeting process 
we review the fair values of each of our reporting units using the discounted cash flows method and market multiples 
retirement and postretirement medical benefits 
each year we calculated the costs of providing retiree benefits under the provisions of sfas  employers accounting for pensions  and sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
the key assumptions used in making these calculations are disclosed in notes and of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the most significant of these assumptions are the discount rate used to value the future obligation  expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates 
we select discount rates commensurate with current market interest rates on high quality  fixed rate debt securities 
the expected return on assets is based on our current review of the long term returns on assets held by the plans  which is influenced by historical averages 
the medical cost trend rate is based on our actual medical claims and future projections of medical cost trends 
asbestos reserve 
we are responsible for certain future liabilities relating to alleged exposure to asbestos containing products 
a september actuarial study estimated a liability for settlement payments ranging from million to million 
we concluded that no amount within the range of settlement payments was more likely than any other and  therefore  recorded the low end of the range as the liability associated with future settlement payments through in our consolidated financial statements  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in accordance with our accounting policy  we update the actuarial study during the third quarter of each year 
the most recent update to the actuarial study was performed as of august  using methodologies consistent with the september study 
the updated study has estimated an undiscounted liability for settlement payments  excluding legal costs  ranging from to million for the period through the change from the prior year study was a million increase for the low end of the range and a million decrease for the high end of the range 
as a result  in september  an incremental million provision was added to the asbestos accrual increasing the reserve to approximately million 
legal costs are estimated to range from to million during the same period 
we plan on performing a similar annual actuarial analysis during the third quarter of each year for the foreseeable future 
based on this analysis and all other available information  we will reassess the recorded liability and  if deemed necessary  record an adjustment to the reserve  which will be reflected as a loss or gain from discontinued operation 
legal expenses associated with asbestos related matters are expensed as incurred and recorded as a loss from discontinued operation in the statement of operations 
other loss reserves 
we have numerous other loss exposures  such as environmental claims  product liability and litigation 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment of risk exposure and ultimate liability 
we estimate losses using consistent and appropriate methods  however  changes to our assumptions could materially affect our recorded liabilities for loss 
recently issued accounting pronouncements medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of in december  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the medicare modernization act was signed into law 
the medicare modernization act expanded medicare to include  for the first time  coverage for prescription drugs 
at present  proposed regulations necessary to implement the medicare modernization act have been issued  including those that would specify the manner in which actuarial equivalency must be determined  the evidence required to demonstrate actuarial equivalency  and the documentation requirements necessary to be entitled to the subsidy 
based on such proposed regulations  we believe that our prescription drug benefit for our employee retirees other than certain union retirees are expected to meet the actuarial equivalence test in and  therefore  we would be eligible to receive a subsidy from medicare 
however  our net periodic postretirement benefit cost does not reflect any amount associated with the subsidy because such subsidy is immaterial in amount 
inventory costs in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
among other provisions  the new rule requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal as stated in arb no 
additionally  sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and is required to be adopted beginning on january  the company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition but do not expect sfas to have a material impact 
pronouncements relating to american jobs creation act of in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no

consequently  the impact of the deduction  which is effective january   will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on the company s income tax returns 
the company does not expect fsp to have a material effect on its financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no

sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  primarily focusing on the accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
entities will be required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service  the requisite service period usually the vesting period  in exchange for the award 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models 
if an equity award is modified after the grant date  incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification 
sfas r is effective for interim and annual financial statements beginning after june  and will apply to all outstanding and unvested share based payments at the time of adoption 
the company is currently evaluating the impact sfas r will have on its consolidated financial statements and will adopt such standard as required 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  primarily related to foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
these exposures are actively monitored by management 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk is due to certain costs  revenues and borrowings being denominated in currencies other than one of our subsidiary s functional currency 
similarly  we are exposed to market risk as the result of changes in interest rates which may affect the cost of our financing 
it is our policy and practice to use derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposures 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
exchange rate risk we have exchange rate exposure  primarily  with respect to the canadian dollar and the british pound 
as of december   our financial instruments which are subject to this exposure are immaterial  therefore the potential immediate loss to us that would result from a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows 
this sensitivity analysis assumes an unfavorable fluctuation in both of the exchange rates affecting both of the foreign currencies in which the indebtedness and the financial instruments described above are denominated and does not take into account the offsetting effect of such a change on our foreign currency denominated revenues 
interest rate risk we manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt in our debt portfolio 
to manage a portion of our exposure to interest rate changes  we enter into interest rate swap agreements 
in october  we entered into a new interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million that is to mature in october under this agreement  we receive a floating rate based on the libor interest rate  and pay a fixed rate of on the notional amount of million 
if  at any time  the swap is determined to be ineffective  in whole or in part  due to changes in the interest rate swap agreement  the fair value of the portion of the interest rate swap determined to be ineffective will be recognized as gain or loss in the statement of operations for the applicable period 
in july  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
the swaps effectively convert a portion of our variable rate debt under the revolving credit facility to a fixed rate  without exchanging the notional amounts 
at december   we had two outstanding interest rate swap agreements in an aggregate notional amount of million  one of which matured in january and the other matured in january under these agreements  we received a floating rate based on the libor interest rate  and paid a fixed rate of on a notional amount of million matured in january and on a notional amount of million matured in january 
at december   we had approximately million in loans and financing outstanding  of which approximately million bear interest at fixed interest rates and approximately million bear interest at variable rates of interest 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments 
our percentage of variable rate debt to total debt was at december  and depending upon the level of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our excess cash  the effect of a hypothetical  instantaneous and unfavorable change of basis points in the interest rate may have approximately million negative impact on our earnings or cash flows
