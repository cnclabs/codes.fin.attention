item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview eog resources  inc eog is one of the largest independent non integrated oil and natural gas companies in the united states with substantial proved reserves in the united states  canada  offshore trinidad and  to a lesser extent  the united kingdom north sea 
eog operates under a consistent business and operational strategy which focuses predominantly on achieving a strong reinvestment rate of return  drilling internally generated prospects  delivering long term production growth and maintaining a strong balance sheet  with a below average debt to total capitalization ratio 
eog had another year of record operating earnings in net income available to common for of million was up over earnings of million  attributable primarily to higher commodity prices and increased production 
at december   eog s total reserves were trillion cubic feet equivalent  an increase of billion cubic feet equivalent bcfe  or higher than operations several important developments have occurred since january  united states and canada 
during  eog opened a new office in fort worth  texas to expand its drilling success in the barnett shale play of the fort worth basin 
eog made significant gas discoveries in the non core portion of the trend located south and west of the city of fort worth 
eog plans to focus on increasing production and further defining the play s ultimate size during eog s effort to identify plays with larger reserve potential has proven a successful supplement to its base development and exploitation program in the united states and canada 
eog plans to continue to drill smaller wells in large acreage plays  which in the aggregate will contribute substantially to eog s crude oil and natural gas production 
eog has several larger potential plays under way in wyoming  utah  texas  oklahoma and western canada 
international 
in mid  eog began natural gas sales to the national gas company of trinidad and tobago ngc under a fifteen year take or pay contract 
this gas is being resold by ngc to an anhydrous ammonia plant located in point lisas  trinidad 
the plant is owned by nitrogen unlimited n 
at december   eog s subsidiary  eog resources nitro ltd  owned an approximate equity interest in n under the contract  eog supplies approximately million cubic feet per day mmcfd gross of natural gas to ngc 
although eog continues to focus on united states and canada natural gas  eog sees an increasing linkage between united states and canada natural gas demand and trinidadian natural gas supply 
for example  liquefied natural gas lng imports from existing and planned facilities in trinidad are serious contenders to meet increasing united states demand 
in addition  ammonia  methanol and chemical production has been relocating from the united states and canada to trinidad  driven by attractive natural gas feedstock prices in the island nation 
eog anticipates that its existing position with the supply contracts to the two ammonia plants and the new methanol plant  will continue to give its portfolio an even broader exposure to united states and canada natural gas fundamentals 
in  eog continued its progress in the southern gas basin of the united kingdom north sea 
a development well was drilled in the valkyrie field and commenced production in august in addition  the production facilities were installed in the arthur field  which was discovered in  and production commenced in january eog continues to review additional opportunities in this area and expects to participate in several exploration wells in capital structure as noted  one of management s key strategies is to keep a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt to total capitalization ratio 
at december   eog s debt to total capitalization ratio was  down from at year end by primarily utilizing cash provided from its operating activities and proceeds from stock options exercised in  eog funded its billion exploration and development expenditures  paid down million of debt  redeemed all outstanding shares of series d preferred stock for million and increased the dividend paid to common shareholders by 
in addition  in  eog s board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend on common stock by 
as management currently assesses price forecast and demand trends for  eog believes that operations and capital expenditure activity can essentially be funded by cash from operations 
for  eog s estimated exploration and development expenditure budget is approximately billion  excluding acquisitions 
united states and canada natural gas continues to be a key component of this effort 
when it fits eog s strategy  eog will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer eog incremental exploration and or production opportunities 
management continues to believe eog has one of the strongest prospect inventories in eog s history 
the following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december  should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of eog and notes thereto beginning with page f results of operations net operating revenues during  net operating revenues increased million to  million 
total wellhead revenues  which are revenues generated from sales of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids from producing wells  increased to  million as compared to  million in natural gas revenues consists of natural gas wellhead revenues and revenues from marketing activities associated with the sales and purchases of natural gas 
revenues from natural gas marketing activities were million for each of and crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids revenues represent solely wellhead revenues for these products 
wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended december  were as follows natural gas volumes mmcf per day united states canada trinidad united kingdom total  average natural gas prices mcf united states canada trinidad united kingdom composite crude oil and condensate volumes mbbl per day united states canada trinidad total average crude oil and condensate prices bbl united states canada trinidad composite natural gas liquids volumes mbbl per day united states canada total average natural gas liquids prices bbl united states canada composite natural gas equivalent volumes mmcfe per day united states canada trinidad united kingdom total    total bcfe deliveries million cubic feet per day or thousand barrels per day  as applicable

the increased deliveries in canada mmcf per day were attributable to property acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of and additional production related to post acquisition drilling 
the increase in trinidad was attributable to the increased production from the u a block mmcf per day which began supplying natural gas in mid to the n ammonia plant and commencement of production from the parula wells on the secc block in february mmcf per day 
wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased million  or  to million from million as compared to  due to increases in both the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price million and the wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries million 
the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for was per barrel compared to per barrel for wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries increased mbbl per day  or  to mbbl per day from mbbl per day for the increase was mainly due to production from new wells in the united states mbbl per day and higher production in trinidad from the parula wells mbbl per day and from the u a block as a result of new production mbbl per day

the exploration and development expenditures of  million included million in development  million in exploration  million in property acquisitions and million in capitalized interest 
the level of exploration and development expenditures  including acquisitions  will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors 
eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant 
there are no material continuing commitments associated with current expenditure plans

financing eog s long term debt to total capitalization ratio was as of december  compared to as of december  during  total long term debt decreased million to  million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the estimated fair value of eog s long term debt at december  and was  million and  million  respectively  based upon quoted market prices and  where such prices were not available  upon interest rates currently available to eog at yearend 
eog s debt is primarily at fixed interest rates 
at december   a decline in interest rates would result in a million increase in the estimated fair value of the fixed rate obligations see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during  eog utilized commercial paper  and during  eog utilized commercial paper and committed bank loans  in addition to operating cash flows  to fund its operations 
these loans are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
while eog maintains a million commercial paper program  the maximum outstanding at any time during was million  and the amount outstanding at yearend was million 
eog considers this excess availability  which is contractually backed by the million revolving credit agreement with domestic and foreign lenders described in note  combined with the million of availability under its shelf registration described below  to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs 
based on resources available at december   during  eog plans to replace the senior unsecured term loan facility due with long term debt 
in  the short term commercial paper loan balance was reduced million and the million  notes were paid off by long term debt refinancing 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes eog s contractual obligations at december  in thousands contractual obligations total beyond long term debt     non cancelable operating leases      drilling rig commitments    pipeline transportation service commitments      seismic purchase obligations   other purchase obligations    total contractual obligations      this table does not include the liability for dismantlement  abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties 
effective with adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations on january   eog recorded a separate liability for the fair value of this asset retirement obligation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  this table does not include eog s pension or postretirement benefit obligations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
commercial paper and the senior unsecured term loan facility due are classified as long term debt on the consolidated balance sheets based on eog s intent and ability to ultimately replace such amounts with other long term debt 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
amounts shown are based on current pipeline transportation rates and the canadian foreign currency exchange rate at december  management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of eog 
shelf registration as of february   the amount available under various filed registration statements with the securities and exchange commission for the offer and sale from time to time of eog debt securities  preferred stock and or common stock totaled million 
off balance sheet arrangements eog does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships 
such entities  often referred to as variable interest entities vie or special purpose entities spe  are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
eog was not involved in any unconsolidated vie or spe financial transactions during any of the reporting periods in this document and has no intention to participate in such transactions in the foreseeable future 
foreign currency exchange rate risk during  eog was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries  including canada  trinidad and the united kingdom 
the foreign currency most significant to eog s operations during was the canadian dollar 
while the continued strengthening of the canadian dollar in impacted both the revenues and expenses recorded on the income statements of eog s canadian subsidiaries  its impacts on the items were not to the same extent 
since the canadian natural gas prices are largely correlated to united states prices  the changes in the canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the canadian revenues than the canadian expenses 
eog continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risk 
effective march   eog entered into a foreign currency swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate any exchange rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of the canadian subsidiaries on the same date see note to the consolidated financial statements 
eog accounts for the foreign currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method  pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas nos 
 and under those provisions  as of december   eog recorded the fair value of the swap of million in other liabilities in the liabilities section of the consolidated balance sheets 
changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to the consolidated statements of income 
the after tax net impact from the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in a negative change of million for the year ended december  this amount is included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets 
outlook natural gas prices historically have been volatile  and this volatility is expected to continue 
uncertainty continues to exist as to the direction of future united states and canada natural gas and crude oil price trends  and there remains a rather wide divergence in the opinions held by some in the industry 
in eog s opinion  overall natural gas production in the united states is declining 
in addition  the increasing recognition of natural gas as a more environmentally friendly source of energy is likely to result in increases in demand 
being primarily a natural gas producer  eog is more significantly impacted by changes in natural gas prices than by changes in crude oil and condensate prices 
longer term natural gas prices will be determined by the supply and demand for natural gas as well as the prices of competing fuels  such as oil and coal 
assuming a totally unhedged position for  based on eog s tax position and the portion of eog s anticipated natural gas volumes for for which prices have not been determined under long term marketing contracts  eog s price sensitivity for each per mcf change in average wellhead natural gas price is approximately million for net income and operating cash flow 
eog is not impacted as significantly by changing crude oil price 
eog s price sensitivity for each per barrel change in average wellhead crude oil prices is approximately million for net income and operating cash flow 
for information regarding eog s natural gas hedge position as of december   see note to the consolidated financial statements 
marketing companies have played an important role in the united states and canada natural gas market 
these companies aggregate natural gas supplies through purchases from producers like eog and then resell the gas to end users  local distribution companies or other buyers 
in recent years  several of the largest natural gas marketing companies have filed for bankruptcy or are having financial difficulty  and others are exiting this business 
eog does not believe that this will have a material effect on its ability to market its natural gas production 
eog continues to assess and monitor the credit worthiness of partners to whom it sells its production and where appropriate  to seek new markets 
eog plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the united states and canada 
however  in order to diversify its overall asset portfolio and as a result of its overall success realized in trinidad and the united kingdom north sea  eog anticipates expending a portion of its available funds in the further development of opportunities outside the united states and canada 
in addition  eog expects to conduct exploratory activity in other areas outside of the united states and canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for involvement in other exploitation type opportunities 
budgeted exploration and development expenditures  excluding acquisitions  are approximately billion and are structured to maintain the flexibility necessary under eog s strategy of funding the united states and canada exploration  exploitation  development and acquisition activities primarily from available internally generated cash flow 
the level of exploration and development expenditures may vary in and will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors 
based upon existing economic and market conditions  eog believes net operating cash flow and available financing alternatives in will be sufficient to fund its net investing cash requirements for the year 
however  eog has significant flexibility with respect to its financing alternatives and adjustment of its exploration  exploitation  development and acquisition expenditure plans if circumstances warrant 
while eog has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to operations in the united states  canada  trinidad and the united kingdom  such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of eog 
environmental regulations various federal  state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to protection of the environment  affect eog s operations and costs as a result of their effect on natural gas and crude oil exploration  development and production operations and could cause eog to incur remediation or other corrective action costs in connection with a release of regulated substances  including crude oil  into the environment 
in addition  eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eog s control 
under environmental laws and regulations  eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators 
in addition  eog could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which eog owns an interest but is not the operator 
compliance with such laws and regulations increases eog s overall cost of business  but has not had a material adverse effect on eog s operations or financial condition 
it is not anticipated  based on current laws and regulations  that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations but  inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed  eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance 
eog also could incur costs related to the clean up of sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning  and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites 
summary of critical accounting policies eog prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
eog identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on  among other things  their impact on the portrayal of eog s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  and the degree of difficulty  subjectivity and complexity in their deployment 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
management routinely discusses the development  selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies 
following is a discussion of eog s most critical accounting policies proved oil and gas reserves eog s engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves  which directly impact financial accounting estimates  including depreciation  depletion and amortization 
proved reserves represent estimated quantities of natural gas  crude oil  condensate  and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made 
the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
consequently  material revisions upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
impairments oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred 
unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are assessed quarterly on a property by property basis  and any impairment in value is recognized 
unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated  and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive  based on historical experience  is amortized over the average holding period 
if the unproved properties are determined to be productive  the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties 
lease rentals are expensed as incurred 
oil and gas exploration costs  other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells  are charged to expense as incurred 
the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether they have discovered proved commercial reserves 
exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production  a conclusive formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore in the gulf of mexico 
if proved commercial reserves are not discovered  such drilling costs are expensed 
in some circumstances  it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been found due to the requirement of a significant capital investment 
such exploratory drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify development when the investment is made and additional exploratory wells are either in progress or firmly planned 
all other exploratory wells that do not meet these criteria are expensed after one year 
as of december  and eog had exploratory drilling costs of million and million  respectively  related to an outside operated  deepwater offshore gulf of mexico discovery that has been deferred for more than one year and will require significant future capital expenditures before production can commence 
these costs meet the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization 
as of december  and  there were no material exploratory drilling costs capitalized for more than one year for projects that did not require a major capital investment 
costs to develop proved reserves  including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of natural gas and crude oil  are capitalized 
when circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired  eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset 
if the future undiscounted cash flows  based on eog s estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices  operating costs  anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data  are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost  the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value 
fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate 
depreciation  depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense 
holding all other factors constant  if reserves were revised upward or downward  earnings would increase or decrease respectively 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit of production method 
the reserve base used to calculate depletion  depreciation or amortization is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties 
the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves for lease and well equipment costs  which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs 
estimated future dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs  net of salvage values  are taken into account 
certain other assets are depreciated on a straight line basis 
assets are grouped in accordance with paragraph of sfas no 
the basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition  such as a reservoir or field 
amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs  reserve revisions upwards or downwards and additions  property acquisitions and or property dispositions  and impairments
