item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview oil and gas prices  the offshore mobile rig count  and deepwater construction activity are three of the primary indicators we use to forecast the future performance of our marine contracting business 
our construction services generally follow successful drilling activities by six to eighteen months on the ocs and twelve months or longer in the deepwater arena 
the level of drilling activity is related to both short and long term trends in oil and gas prices 
oil and natural gas prices have been at robust levels for the last two years and offshore drilling activity has increased  but only recently in the gulf of mexico 
our primary leading indicator  the number of offshore mobile rigs contracted  is currently at approximately rigs employed in the gulf of mexico  slightly higher than year ago levels of and compared to during the first quarter of the deepwater gulf is principally being developed for oil  with the complexity of developing these reservoirs resulting in significant lead times to first production 
in the north sea  the rig count is currently at rigs employed  which compared to during the first quarter of our business is substantially dependent upon the condition of the oil and gas industry and  in particular  the willingness of oil and gas companies to make capital expenditures for offshore exploration  drilling and production operations 
the level of capital expenditures generally depends on the prevailing view of future oil and gas prices  which are influenced by numerous factors affecting the supply and demand for oil and gas  including  but not limited to worldwide economic activity  economic and political conditions in the middle east and other oil producing regions  coordination by the organization of petroleum exporting countries  or opec  the cost of exploring for and producing oil and gas  the sale and expiration dates of offshore leases in the united states and overseas  the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves in offshore areas  technological advances  interest rates and the cost of capital  environmental regulations  and tax policies 
the level of offshore construction activity has increased only modestly despite higher commodity prices in and we cannot assure you that activity levels will continue to increase 
a sustained period of low drilling and production activity or the return of lower commodity prices would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
product prices impact our oil and gas operations in several respects 
historically  we sought to acquire producing oil and gas properties that were generally in the later stages of their economic life 
the sellers potential abandonment liabilities are a significant consideration with respect to the offshore properties we have purchased to date 
although higher natural gas prices tend to reduce the number of mature properties available for sale  these higher prices typically contribute to improved operating results for ert 
in contrast  lower natural gas prices typically contribute to lower operating results for ert and a general increase in the number of mature properties available for sale 
in  we expanded the scope of our gas and oil operations by taking a working interest in gunnison  a deepwater gulf development of kerr mcgee oil gas corp 
in  ert continued to successfully pursue its strategy of acquiring or partnering in and developing proved undeveloped  or high probability of success reserves  ie  leases where reserves were judged by the current owner to be too marginal to justify development or they were seeking a partner 
each of ert s oil and gas investments is designed to secure utilization of cdi construction vessels 
in our production facilities segment we participate in the ownership of production facilities in hub locations where there is potential for significant subsea tieback activity 
we have a interest in the tlp at marco polo  which began production in the second quarter of  and a interest in the independence hub semi submersible which should be online in early see further discussion on the independence hub under liquidity and capital resources investing activities 
gunnison reserves constitute approximately of our total proved reserves as of december  this annual report contains estimates of our proved oil and gas reserves based upon reports audited by our independent petroleum engineers 
the process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex  requiring significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
as a result  these estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  cash flows  development expenditures  operating and abandonment expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those estimated in these reports 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our proved reserves 
further  costs incurred relating to unsuccessful exploratory wells are expensed in the period the drilling is determined to be unsuccessful 
as an extension of ert s well exploitation and pud strategies  ert agreed to participate in the drilling of an exploratory well to be drilled in that targets reserves in deeper sands  within the same trapping fault system  of a currently producing well with estimated drilling costs of approximately million  of which million of equipment costs had been incurred through december  if the drilling is successful  ert s share of the development cost is estimated to be an additional million 
our marine contracting assets would participate in this development 
regarding marine contracting  vessel utilization is historically lower during the first quarter due to winter weather conditions in the gulf and the north sea 
accordingly  we normally plan our drydock inspections and other routine and preventive maintenance programs during this period 
during the first quarter  a substantial number of our customers finalize capital budgets and solicit bids for construction projects 
the bid and award process during the first two quarters typically leads to the commencement of construction activities during the second and third quarters 
as a result  we have historically generated up to of our marine contracting revenues in the last six months of the year 
our operations can also be severely impacted by weather during the fourth quarter 
operation of oil and gas properties and production facilities tends to offset the impact of weather since the first and fourth quarters are typically periods of high demand and strong prices for natural gas 
due to this seasonality  full year results are not likely to be a direct multiple of any particular quarter or combination of quarters 
the following table sets forth for the periods presented average us natural gas prices  our equivalent natural gas production  the average number of offshore rigs under contract in the gulf  the number of platforms installed and removed in the gulf and the vessel utilization rates for each of the major categories of our fleet

critical accounting policies our results of operations and financial condition  as reflected in the accompanying financial statements and related footnotes  are subject to management s evaluation and interpretation of business conditions  changing capital market conditions and other factors which could affect the ongoing viability of our business segments and or our customers 
we believe the most critical accounting policies in this regard are those described below 
while these issues require us to make judgments that are somewhat subjective  they are generally based on a significant amount of historical data and current market data 
accounting for oil and gas properties ert acquisitions of producing offshore properties are recorded at the fair value exchanged at closing together with an estimate of its proportionate share of the decommissioning liability assumed in the purchase based upon its working interest ownership percentage 
in estimating the decommissioning liability assumed in offshore property acquisitions  we perform detailed estimating procedures  including engineering studies and then reflect the liability at fair value on a discounted basis as discussed below 
we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our interests in oil and gas properties 
under the successful efforts method  the costs of successful wells and leases containing productive reserves are capitalized 
costs incurred to drill and equip development wells  including unsuccessful development wells  are capitalized 
costs incurred relating to unsuccessful exploratory wells are expensed in the period the drilling is determined to be unsuccessful 
goodwill the company tests for the impairment of goodwill on at least an annual basis 
the company s goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each of the company s reporting units with its carrying amount 
the fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and other market related valuation models  such as earnings multiples and comparable asset market values 
prior to goodwill was amortized on a straight line basis over years 
in the company discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
the company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of november  the company s goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each of the company s reporting units with its carrying amount 
all of the company s goodwill as of december  and related to its marine contracting segment 
none of the company s goodwill was impaired based on the impairment test performed as of november  the company will continue to test its goodwill annually on a consistent measurement date unless events occur or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
property and equipment property and equipment  both owned and under capital leases  are recorded at cost 
depreciation is provided primarily on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets described in footnote to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
for long lived assets to be held and used  excluding goodwill  the company bases its evaluation of recoverability on impairment indicators such as the nature of the assets  the future economic benefit of the assets  any historical or future profitability measurements and other external market conditions or factors that may be present 
if such impairment indicators are present or other factors exist that indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  the company determines whether an impairment has occurred through the use of an undiscounted cash flows analysis of the asset at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist 
the company s marine vessels are assessed on a vessel by vessel basis  while the company s rovs are grouped and assessed by asset class 
if an impairment has occurred  the company recognizes a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
the fair value of the asset is measured using quoted market prices or  in the absence of quoted market prices  is based on management s estimate of discounted cash flows 
the company recorded an impairment charge of million included in marine contracting cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations in december on certain marine contracting vessels that met the impairment criteria 
assets are classified as held for sale when the company has a plan for disposal of certain assets and those assets meet the held for sale criteria 
during the fourth quarter of  the company classified a certain marine contracting vessel and other property and equipment intended to be disposed of within a twelve month period as assets held for sale totaling million included in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december  
the company recorded an impairment charge of million included in marine contracting cost of sales  representing the amount by which their carrying value exceeds estimated fair value less cost to sell 
the company evaluates the impairment of its oil and gas properties on a field by field basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate  but at least annually  an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
unamortized capital costs are reduced to fair value based upon discounted cash flows if the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the asset s net book value 
cash flows are determined based upon proved reserves using prices and costs consistent with those used for internal decision making 
although prices used are likely to approximate market  they do not necessarily represent current market prices 
proved oil and gas reserve quantities are based on estimates prepared by company engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the us securities and exchange commission 
the company s estimates of reserves at december   have been audited by huddleston co  independent petroleum engineers 
all of the company s reserves are located in the united states 
proved reserves cannot be measured exactly because the estimation of reserves involves numerous judgmental determinations 
accordingly  reserve estimates must be continually revised as a result of new information obtained from drilling and production history  new geological and geophysical data and changes in economic conditions 
recertification costs and deferred drydock charges the company s marine contracting vessels are required by regulation to be recertified after certain periods of time 
these recertification costs are incurred while the vessel is in drydock where other routine repairs and maintenance are performed and  at times  major replacements and improvements are performed 
the company expenses routine repairs and maintenance as they are incurred 
recertification costs can be accounted for in one of three ways defer and amortize  accrue in advance  or expense as incurred 
companies in the industry use either the defer and amortize or the expense as incurred accounting method 
the company defers and amortizes recertification costs over the length of time in which the recertification is expected to last  which is generally months 
major replacements and improvements  which extend the vessel s economic useful life or functional operating capability  are capitalized and depreciated over the vessel s remaining economic useful life 
inherent in this process are estimates the company makes regarding the specific cost incurred and the period that the incurred cost will benefit 
the company accounts for regulatory us coast guard  american bureau of shipping and det norske veritas related drydock inspection and certification expenditures by capitalizing the related costs and amortizing them over the month period between regulatory mandated drydock inspections and certification 
as of december  and  capitalized deferred drydock charges included in other assets  net totaled million and million  respectively 
during the years ended december   and  drydock amortization expense was million  million and million  respectively 
accounting for decommissioning liabilities statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  addresses the financial accounting and reporting obligations and retirement costs related to the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
among other things  sfas no 
requires oil and gas companies to reflect decommissioning liabilities on the face of the balance sheet at fair value on a discounted basis 
ert historically has purchased producing offshore oil and gas properties that are in the later stages of production 
in conjunction with acquiring these properties  ert assumes an obligation associated with decommissioning the property in accordance with the regulations set by government agencies 
the abandonment liability related to the acquisitions of these properties is determined through a series of management estimates 
prior to an acquisition and as part of evaluating the economics of an acquisition  ert will estimate the plug and abandonment liability 
ert personnel prepare detailed cost estimates to plug and abandon wells and remove necessary equipment in accordance with regulatory guidelines 
ert currently calculates the discounted value of the abandonment liability based on the estimated year the abandonment will occur in accordance with sfas no 
and capitalizes that portion as part of the basis acquired and records the related abandonment liability at fair value 
decommissioning liabilities were million and million at december  and  respectively 
on an ongoing basis  ert personnel monitor the status of wells on the properties  and as fields deplete and no longer produce  ert will monitor the timing requirements set forth by the mms for plugging and abandoning the wells and commence abandonment operations  when applicable 
on an annual basis  ert and cal dive management personnel review and update the abandonment estimates and assumptions for changes  among other things  in market conditions  interest rates and historical experience 
the adoption of sfas no 
resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment as of january  to record i a million decrease in the carrying values of proved properties  ii a million decrease in accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization of property and equipment  iii a million decrease in decommissioning liabilities and iv a million increase in deferred income tax liabilities 
the net impact of items i through iv was to record a gain of million  net of tax  as a cumulative effect adjustment of a change in accounting principle in the company s consolidated statements of operations upon adoption on january  the company has no material assets that are legally restricted for purposes of settling its decommissioning liabilities other than million of restricted cash held in escrow included in other assets  net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet see liquidity and capital resources investing activities 
revenue recognition the company earns the majority of marine contracting revenues during the summer and fall months 
revenues are derived from billings under contracts which are typically of short duration that provide for either lump sum turnkey charges or specific time  material and equipment charges which are billed in accordance with the terms of such contracts 
the company recognizes revenue as it is earned at estimated collectible amounts 
revenues generated from specific time  materials and equipment charges contracts are generally earned on a dayrate basis and recognized as amounts are earned in accordance with contract terms 
revenues generated in the pre operation mode before a contract commences are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis in accordance with contract terms 
direct and incremental costs associated with pre operation activities are similarly deferred and recognized over the estimated contract period 
revenue on significant turnkey contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion  or achievement of certain contractual milestones if provided for in the contract 
contract price and cost estimates are reviewed periodically as work progresses and adjustments are reflected in the period in which such estimates are revised 
provisions for estimated losses on such contracts are made in the period such losses are determined 
the company recognizes additional contract revenue related to claims when the claim is probable and legally enforceable 
unbilled revenue represents revenue attributable to work completed prior to year end which has not yet been invoiced 
all amounts included in unbilled revenue at december  are expected to be billed and collected within one year 
the company records revenues from the sales of crude oil and natural gas when delivery to the customer has occurred and title has transferred 
this occurs when production has been delivered to a pipeline or a barge lifting has occurred 
the company may have an interest with other producers in certain properties 
in this case the company uses the entitlements method to account for sales of production 
under the entitlements method the company may receive more or less than its entitled share of production 
if the company receives more than its entitled share of production  the imbalance is treated as a liability 
if the company receives less than its entitled share  the imbalance is recorded as an asset 
as of december  the net imbalance was million and was included in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
accounts receivable and allowance for uncollectible accounts accounts receivable are stated at the historical carrying amount net of write offs and allowance for uncollectible accounts 
the company establishes an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable based on historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that the company has identified 
uncollectible accounts receivable are written off when a settlement is reached for an amount that is less that the outstanding historical balance or when the company has determined the balance will not be collected 
foreign currency the functional currency for the company s foreign subsidiary  cal dive international limited formerly known as well ops uk limited  is the applicable local currency british pound 
results of operations for this subsidiary are translated into us dollars using average exchange rates during the period 
assets and liabilities of this foreign subsidiary are translated into us dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date and the resulting translation adjustment  which was a gain in and of million and million net of taxes in  respectively  is included as accumulated other comprehensive income  as a component of shareholders equity 
beginning in  deferred taxes have not been provided on foreign currency translation adjustments since the company considers its undistributed earnings when applicable of its non us subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested 
as a result  cumulative deferred taxes on translation adjustments totaling approximately million were reclassified from noncurrent deferred income taxes and accumulated other comprehensive income 
all foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized currently in the statements of operations 
canyon offshore  the company s rov subsidiary  has operations in the europe west africa and asia pacific regions 
canyon conducts the majority of its affairs in these regions in us dollars which it considers the functional currency 
when currencies other than the us dollar are to be paid or received the resulting gain or loss from translation is recognized in the statements of operations 
these amounts for the years ended december  and  respectively  were not material to the company s results of operations or cash flows 
accounting for price risk management activities the company s price risk management activities involve the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge the impact of market price risk exposures primarily related to our oil and gas production 
all derivatives are reflected in our balance sheet at their fair market value 
there are two types of hedging activities hedges of cash flow exposure and hedges of fair value exposure 
the company engages primarily in cash flow hedges 
hedges of cash flow exposure are entered into to hedge a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability 
changes in the derivative fair values that are designated as cash flow hedges are deferred to the extent that they are effective and are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged transactions occur and are recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a cash flow hedge s change in value is recognized immediately in earnings in oil and gas production revenues 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives  strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions and our methods for assessing and testing correlation and hedge ineffectiveness 
all hedging instruments are linked to the hedged asset  liability  firm commitment or forecasted transaction 
we also assess  both at the inception of the hedge and on an on going basis  whether the derivatives that are used in our hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items 
we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively if we determine that a derivative is no longer highly effective as a hedge or it is probable that a hedged transaction will not occur 
if hedge accounting is discontinued  deferred gains or losses on the hedging instruments are recognized in earnings immediately 
the fair value of hedging instruments reflects our best estimate and is based upon exchange or over the counter quotations whenever they are available 
quoted valuations may not be available due to location differences or terms that extend beyond the period for which quotations are available 
where quotes are not available  we utilize other valuation techniques or models to estimate market values 
these modeling techniques require us to make estimations of future prices  price correlation and market volatility and liquidity 
our actual results may differ from our estimates  and these differences can be positive or negative 
during and  the company entered into various cash flow hedging swap and costless collar contracts to stabilize cash flows relating to a portion of the company s oil and gas production 
all of these qualified for hedge accounting and none extended beyond a year and a half 
the aggregate fair value of the hedge instruments was a net liability of  and million as of december  and  respectively 
for the years ended december  and the company recorded unrealized gains of approximately  and million  net of taxes of  and  respectively  in other comprehensive income  a component of shareholders equity as these hedges were highly effective 
the balance in the cash flow hedge adjustments account is recognized in earnings when the hedged item is sold 
during and  the company reclassified approximately million and million  respectively  of losses from other comprehensive income to oil and gas production revenues upon the sale of the related oil and gas production 
equity investments our equity investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries include our investments in deepwater gateway  llc and independence hub  llc 
we review our equity investments for impairment and record an adjustment when we believe the decline in fair value is other than temporary 
the fair value of the asset is measured using quoted market prices or  in the absence of quoted market prices  fair value is based on an estimate of discounted cash flows 
in determining whether the decline is other than temporary  we consider the cyclical nature of the industry in which the investment operates  its historical performance  its performance in relation to its peers and the current economic environment 
we will monitor the fair value of our investments for impairment and will record an adjustment if we believe a decline is other than temporary 
during and no impairment indicators existed 
income taxes deferred income taxes are based on the difference between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company utilizes the liability method of computing deferred income taxes 
the liability method is based on the amount of current and future taxes payable using tax rates and laws in effect at the balance sheet date 
income taxes have been provided based upon the tax laws and rates in the countries in which operations are conducted and income is earned 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all of the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company considers the undistributed earnings of its non us subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested 
at december   the company s non us subsidiaries had an accumulated deficit of million in earnings and profits 
these losses are primarily due to timing differences related to fixed assets 
the company has not provided deferred us income tax on the losses 
see footnote to the consolidated financial statements included herein for discussion of net operating loss carry forwards and deferred income taxes 
worker s compensation claims our onshore employees are covered by worker s compensation 
offshore employees  including divers and tenders and marine crews  are covered by our maritime employers liability insurance policy which covers jones act exposures 
the company incurs worker s compensation claims in the normal course of business  which management believes are substantially covered by insurance 
the company  its insurers and legal counsel analyze each claim for potential exposure and estimate the ultimate liability of each claim

the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas no 
r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
the company has not yet determined the method of adoption of sfas no

as amended by sfas no 
 assets received in some circumstances will have to be recorded instead at their fair values 
in the past  the company has not engaged in a large number of nonmonetary asset exchanges for significant amounts 
results of operations we derive our revenues  earnings and cash flows from three primary business segments marine contracting  oil and gas production and production facilities 
within marine contracting  we operate primarily in the gulf of mexico gulf  and recently in the north sea and asia pacific regions  with services that cover the lifecycle of an offshore oil or gas field 
our current diversified fleet of vessels and remotely operated vehicles rovs and trencher systems perform services that support drilling  well completion  intervention  construction and decommissioning projects involving pipelines  production platforms  risers and subsea production systems 
we also have a significant investment in offshore oil and gas production as well as production facilities 
operations in the production facilities segment began in with marco polo coming online 
investments in our production facilities segment is currently accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
our customers include major and independent oil and gas producers  pipeline transmission companies and offshore engineering and construction firms 
comparison of years ended and revenues 
during the year ended december   the company s revenues increased to million compared to million for the year ended december  of the overall million increase  million was generated by the oil and gas production segment due to increased oil and gas production and higher commodity prices 
marine contracting revenues increased million from million for to million for due primarily to slightly increased utilization and improved contract pricing for the company s well ops group and improved performance from the company s rov division 
oil and gas production revenue for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million during production increased bcfe for the year ended december  compared to bcfe in primarily as a result of our successful well exploitation program  bringing a subsea pud development online late in  and gunnison wells coming online throughout and provided of total production 
the average realized natural gas price of per mcf  net of hedges in place  during was higher than the per mcf realized in while average realized oil prices  net of hedges in place  increased to per barrel compared to per barrel realized during gross profit 
gross profit of million for the year ended december  represented an increase compared to the million recorded in the prior year with the oil and gas production segment contributing of the increase 
marine contracting gross profit increased to million  for the year ended december   from million in the prior year 
the increase was primarily attributable to improved contract pricing for the company s well ops group and improved performance from the company s rov division  partially offset by asset impairments on certain shelf and deepwater division vessels totaling million for conditions meeting the company s asset impairment criteria 
oil and gas production gross profit increased million  to million  due to the aforementioned higher levels of production and commodity price increases 
gross margins of in were points better than the in marine contracting margins increased points to for the year ended december   from in the prior year  due to the factors noted above 
in addition  margins in the oil and gas production segment increased points to for the year ended december   from in  due primarily to the higher oil and gas commodity prices 
selling administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses of million for the year ended december  were million higher than the million incurred in due primarily to an increase in the marine contracting compensation program  which is based on certain individual performance criteria and the company s profitability  and the ert incentive compensation program  which is tied directly to the oil and gas production segment profitability that was significantly higher in compared to selling and administrative expenses at of revenues for matched that of the prior year 
equity in earnings of production facilities investments 
equity in earnings of the company s investment in deepwater gateway  llc increased to million in compared with a loss of  in the increase was attributable to the demand fees which commenced following the march mechanical completion of the marco polo tension leg platform  owned by deepwater gateway  llc  as well as production tariff charges which commenced in the third quarter of as marco polo began producing 
other income expense 
the company reported other expense of million for the year ended december  compared to other expense of million for the year ended december  net interest expense of million in was higher than the million incurred in  due primarily to  of capitalized interest in  compared with million in  which related to the company s investment in gunnison and construction of the marco polo tension leg platform  both of which were online at different times during income taxes 
income taxes increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million in  primarily due to increased profitability 
the effective tax rate of in is lower than the effective tax rate for due to the benefit recognized by the company for its research and development credits in the first quarter of as a result of the conclusion of the internal revenue service irs examination of the company s income tax returns for and  and the tax cost or benefit of us and uk branch operations 
net income 
net income of million for was million greater than as a result of the factors described above 
further  convertible preferred stock dividends and accretion increased from million in to million in as a result of the series a tranche of convertible preferred stock issued in june to the existing holder 
see liquidity and capital resources financing activities 
comparison of years ended and revenues 
during the year ended december   revenues increased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  the marine contracting segment contributed million of the increase  primarily as a result of the acquisition of the seawell during the third quarter of in addition  the q  intrepid and eclipse worked a full year in as compared to nine months in the prior year  as these vessels were placed in service in the second quarter of oil and gas production revenue for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million during the prior year 
the increase was due to a increase in our average realized commodity prices to per mcfe  net of hedges in place per mcfe of natural gas and per barrel of oil in from per mcfe per mcfe of natural gas and per barrel of oil in production increased to bcfe during from bcfe during the prior year as a result of the property acquisitions during the third quarter of and gunnison coming on line in december gross profit 
gross profit of million for was million  or  greater than the million gross profit recorded in the prior year due entirely to the revenue increase in oil and gas production mentioned above 
oil and gas production gross profit increased million from million in to million for  due to the increases in average realized commodity prices and production described above 
gross margins improved to for the year ended december  compared to during due primarily to the aforementioned increases in average realized commodity prices 
marine contracting margins decreased from for to during due mainly to the depressed markets for offshore construction in the gom and the north sea  increased competition in the ocs market and increased offshore insurance costs offset by the impact of charges recorded in the fourth quarter of related to a contract dispute 
selling administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses were million in  which is more than the million incurred in  primarily due to the addition of business units acquired and higher ert incentive accruals 
selling and administrative expenses were of revenues for  which was two points better than the for due primarily to the eex settlement charges in the fourth quarter of other income expense 
the company reported other expense of million for the year ended december  in contrast to million for included in other expense for is a million gain on our foreign currency derivative associated with the acquisition of well ops uk limited recorded in other income in june net interest expense of million for is higher than the million in the prior year as a result of our higher debt levels and the reduction of capitalized interest expense as the q and intrepid were in service for only the last nine months of income taxes 
income taxes increased to million for  compared to million in the prior year period  due to increased profitability 
the effective rate increased to in compared to in due primarily to provisions for foreign taxes 
the irs is in the process of examining our income tax return for years and  and the pre acquisition income tax return for canyon offshore inc we believe the ultimate resolution of these audits will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
net income 
net income of million for was million  or  greater than  as a result of the factors described above 
item liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources in august  we closed the long term marad financing for construction of the q this us government guaranteed financing is pursuant to title xi of the merchant marine act of which is administered by the maritime administration 
we refer to this debt as marad debt 
at december   million was outstanding on this debt 
in august we closed a four year  million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
this facility was undrawn upon at december  in january  we acquired canyon offshore  inc  in july  we acquired the well operations business unit of technip coflexip and  in august  ert made two significant property acquisitions 
these acquisitions significantly increased our debt to total book capitalization ratio from at december  to at december  cash flow from operations  along with the private placement of convertible preferred stock in january million  or million net of transaction costs and june million  or million net of transaction costs  have enabled us to reduce this ratio to as of december   as well as to build million of unrestricted cash as of december  operating activities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is currently exposed to market risk in three major areas interest rates  commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk because the majority of the company s debt at december  was based on floating rates  changes in interest would  assuming all other things equal  have a minimal impact on the fair value of the debt instruments  but every basis points move in interest rates would result in approximately million of annualized interest expense or savings  as the case may be  to the company 
commodity price risk the company has utilized derivative financial instruments with respect to a portion of and oil and gas production to achieve a more predictable cash flow by reducing its exposure to price fluctuations 
the company does not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
as of december   the company has the following volumes under derivative contracts related to its oil and gas producing activities average monthly weighted average production period instrument type volumes price crude oil january june swap mbbl january september collar mbbl natural gas january june collar  mmbtu changes in nymex oil and gas strip prices would  assuming all other things being equal  cause the fair value of these instruments to increase or decrease inversely to the change in nymex prices 
subsequent to december   the company entered into additional oil costless collars for the periods july through december and october through december the july contract covers mbbl per month at a price of to and the october contract covers mbbl per month at a price of to 
the company also entered into additional natural gas costless collars for the period july through december the contracts cover  mmbtu per month at a weighted average price of to 
foreign currency exchange rates because we operate in various oil and gas exploration and production regions in the world  we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the us dollar primarily with respect to cal dive international limited 
the functional currency for cal dive international limited is the applicable local currency british pound 
although the revenues are denominated in the local currency  the effects of foreign currency fluctuations are partly mitigated because local expenses of such foreign operations also generally are denominated in the same currency 
the impact of exchange rate fluctuations during the years ended december  and  respectively  did not have a material effect on reported amounts of revenues or net income 
assets and liabilities of cal dive international limited are translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date  resulting in translation adjustments that are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the shareholders equity section of our balance sheet 
approximately of our assets are impacted by changes in foreign currencies in relation to the us dollar 
we recorded gains of and million net of taxes in to our equity account in the years ended december  and  respectively  to reflect the net impact of the decline of the us dollar against the british pound 
beginning in  deferred taxes have not been provided on foreign currency translation adjustments since the company considers its undistributed earnings when applicable of its non us subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested 
as a result  cumulative deferred taxes on translation adjustments totaling approximately million were reclassified from noncurrent deferred income taxes and accumulated other comprehensive income 
canyon offshore  the company s rov subsidiary  has operations in the europe west africa and asia pacific regions 
canyon conducts the majority of its operations in these regions in us dollars which it considers the functional currency 
when currencies other than the us dollar are to be paid or received  the resulting transaction gain or loss is recognized in the statements of operations 
these amounts for the years ended december  and  respectively  were not material to the company s results of operations or cash flows
