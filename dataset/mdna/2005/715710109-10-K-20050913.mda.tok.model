on december  we completed the acquisition of data junction corporation data junction 
the aggregate cash plus share purchase price for all of the common stock of data junction was approximately million  net of cash acquired from data junction see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the results of operations of data junction from december  to june   or the stub period  are included in our fiscal consolidated results of operations 
the acquisition of data junction brought data integration and transformation technologies and products  which are complementary to our existing data management products  expertise and customer base 
winner of more than major industry awards  data junction was a market leader in innovative integration technology  helping customers quickly and cost effectively connect disparate data sources 
primary integration products include a comprehensive set of visual design tools for rapidly building and testing data integration processes that work with hundreds of data formats and applications 
this enables design with total control over all aspects of the integration project from creating integration maps to managing complex  event driven flow of inter application messages and edi processes 
data junction virtually created the category known as etl extract  transform and load in with data junction v  one of the world s first hub and spoke approaches to data conversion and translation  and today is charting new ground in the development of business and application integration technologies 
in july  we formed a new business venture with ag tech corporation  a company developing  selling and importing packaged software  to sell and support our products in japan 
ag tech has been engaged in the sales and support of btrieve predecessor to pervasive 
sql and pervasive 
sql products since in conjunction with the joint venture  ag tech launched a new operating division staffed with specialists experienced in selling and supporting pervasive 
sql to assume responsibility for oem sales  packaged software sales  technical support and localization and translation of our products into japanese 
the new business venture has resulted in improved profitability on sales in japan as the arrangement allowed us to significantly reduce our costs in japan 
in connection with the new business venture  we obtained a less than ownership interest in ag tech and the ability to elect one director to the ag tech board of directors 
pervasive s revenues from japan were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
in june  we renewed portions of our distribution agreement with ag tech for an additional three year period ending june  critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making 
table of contents 
index to financial statements judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies revenue recognition sales returns and bad debt reserves goodwill and other intangible assets taxes revenue recognition we license our software through oem license agreements with software developers  or isvs  and through shrink wrap software licenses  sold through isvs  value added resellers  or vars  systems integrators and distributors  or direct to end users 
revenues are generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  no significant company obligations with regard to implementation remain  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
revenues related to oem license agreements involving nonrefundable fixed minimum license fees are generally recognized upon delivery of the product master or first copy if no significant vendor obligations remain 
per copy royalties related to oem license agreements in excess of a fixed minimum amount are recognized as revenue when such amounts are reported to us 
revenue from post contract support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades is recognized ratably over the contract term 
we generally provide telephone support to customers and end users in the days immediately following the sale at no additional charge and at a minimal cost per call 
we accrue the cost of providing this support 
revenue from consulting services and training is recognized when the related services are performed 
we enter into agreements with certain distributors that provide for certain stock rotation and price protection rights 
these rights allow the distributor to return products in a non cash exchange for other products or for credits against future purchases 
revenue from shipping and handling is recognized at the shipping date 
shipping and handling costs are included in costs of product license revenues in the consolidated statements of operations 
where software licenses are sold with maintenance or other services  we allocate the total fee to the various elements based on the fair values of the elements 
we determine the fair value of each element in the arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
vsoe of fair value is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately and  for support services  is additionally measured by the renewal rate 
if we do not have vsoe for one of the delivered elements of an arrangement  but do have vsoe for all undelivered elements  we use the residual method to record revenue 
under the residual method  the arrangement fee is first allocated to the undelivered elements based upon their vsoe of fair value  the remaining arrangement fee  including any discount  is allocated to the delivered element 
if the residual method is not used  discounts  if any  are applied proportionately to each element included in the arrangement based on each element s fair value without regard to the discount 
sales returns and bad debt reserves we reserve for the cost of estimated sales returns  stock rotation and price protection rights as well as uncollectible accounts based on experience 
goodwill and other intangible assets we assess whether goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are impaired on an annual basis 
upon determining the existence of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangibles impairment  we measure that impairment based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangibles exceeds its fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated 
additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstance that would indicate that  more likely than not  the book value of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangibles has been impaired

index to financial statements taxes under the asset and liability method of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes statement  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we then assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we establish a valuation allowance 
we concluded that a full valuation allowance was required for all periods presented 
while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made  increasing our income in the period in which such determination was made 
pursuant to the internal revenue code  the amounts of and benefits from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances 
events which cause limitations in the amount of net operating losses and tax credits that we may utilize include  but are not limited to  a cumulative change of more than ownership of the company  as defined  over a three year period  and changes in the relative mix of our foreign source taxable income versus our domestic taxable income 
further  our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are subject to potential expiration if not utilized by certain dates in the future 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we are regularly under audit by tax authorities 
accruals for tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
although we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns  we have recorded a liability for our best estimate of the probable loss on certain of these positions 
we believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years  based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter  which matters result primarily from intercompany transfer pricing 
although we believe our recorded assets and liabilities are reasonable  tax regulations are subject to interpretation and tax litigation is inherently uncertain  therefore our assessments can involve both a series of complex judgments about future events and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions 
although we believe that the estimates and assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities 
based on the results of an audit or litigation  a material effect on our income tax provision  net income  or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 
due to the complexity involved we are not able to estimate the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts recorded

sql  decreased in fiscal year  relative to the fiscal year we believe this decrease was due to a variety of factors  including but not limited to  the length of time since the last major version release of our database product version in december  increasing competition and what we believe to be the increasingly negative impact of general economic conditions on our isv customers who build applications utilizing our database software and reduced demand for the isvs software applications themselves 
revenue from recently introduced add on products for our database products  namely auditmaster and data exchange  continued to generate database related revenue in the year ended june  as we continue to market these add on products to our large base of database customers 
our embedded database and related products represented approximately of our revenue in fiscal year in addition  we believe the integration products we acquired in fiscal year represent a compelling growth opportunity as we invest in revenue synergies and opportunities presented by the acquired business  combined with our historical database business and channels 
our integration products represented approximately of our revenue in fiscal year and although we have not generated substantial revenue from pervasive postgres to date  we believe that our entry in to the open source database market represents an exciting opportunity to be a significant participant in this emerging market 
a continued reduction in our embedded database business  or our inability to grow our integration products business and our open source database business  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition

table of contents 
index to financial statements service revenues from data junction related products and services during the stub period 
the decrease in revenue in fiscal year is primarily attributable to a decrease in our embedded database product revenue  partially offset by the inclusion of a full twelve months of revenue from data junction related products and services in fiscal year versus only seven months in fiscal year our product license revenues were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  which represents an increase of from fiscal to  and a decrease of from fiscal to the increase in product license revenue from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to the inclusion of license revenue from data junction related products during the stub period 
the decrease in product license revenue from fiscal to fiscal is attributable to a decrease in our embedded database product revenue  partially offset by the inclusion of a full twelve months of revenue from data junction related products in fiscal year versus only seven months in fiscal year licenses of our software operating on windows nt or other microsoft operating systems continue to represent approximately to of our database product license revenues 
we expect that the percentages of our revenue attributable to licenses of our software operating on particular platforms will continue to change from time to time 
we cannot be certain that our revenue attributable to licenses of our software operating on windows nt  or any other operating system platform  will grow in the future 
our service and other revenues were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  which represents an increase of from fiscal to  and an increase of from fiscal to the increase in service and other revenue from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to the inclusion of service and other revenue from data junction services during the stub period 
the increase in service and other revenue from fiscal to fiscal is primarily related to inclusion of service and other revenues from data junction services for a full twelve months in fiscal year  versus only seven months in fiscal year international revenues  consisting of all revenue from customers located outside of north america  were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
we attribute the increase in international revenue in fiscal year primarily to increased revenue in japan and to the inclusion of revenue from data junction related products and services during the stub period 
international revenue as a percentage of total revenues in decreased from prior year due to inclusion of data junction revenues during the stub period  as data junction revenues are more predominantly from north america 
we attribute the increase in international revenue in fiscal year to increased database revenue in europe and inclusion of international integration product revenues for a full year in fiscal year we expect that international revenue will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future 
costs and expenses cost of product licenses revenues 
cost of product licenses revenues consists primarily of the cost to manufacture and fulfill orders for our shrink wrap software products  payment of license fees for third party technologies embedded in our products and amortization of purchased technology 
cost of product licenses revenues for continuing operations was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenues respectively 
cost of product licenses revenue increased in dollar amount in fiscal as compared to fiscal principally as the result of amortization related to the million value assigned to developed technology acquired through the data junction acquisition 
the data junction acquisition occurred in the second quarter of fiscal  and accordingly  we began to recognize amortization expense in the stub period 
cost of product licenses revenue increased in fiscal year primarily due to a full year of amortization of purchased technology acquired through the data junction acquisition 
we anticipate that cost of product licenses revenue will increase slightly in fiscal year primarily due to amortization of approximately million of other third party technologies licensed late in fiscal year 
table of contents 
index to financial statements cost of services and other revenues 
cost of services and other revenues consists primarily of the cost to provide technical support  primarily telephone support  which is typically provided within days of purchase and the costs to deliver professional services and training services to others 
cost of services and other revenues for continuing operations was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
cost of services and other revenues increased in dollar amount in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily as a result of an increase in technical support and consulting personnel and related operating costs associated with the data junction operations subsequent to the december  acquisition date 
cost of services and other revenues decreased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily as a result of a decrease in technical support and consulting personnel and related operating costs 
we anticipate that cost of services and other revenues will increase in fiscal year primarily due to an anticipated increase in technical support and consulting personnel and related operating costs and due to the inclusion of compensation costs associated with stock options in accordance with sfas no

sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by sales and marketing personnel  foreign sales office expenses  travel and entertainment  marketing programs and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses related to continuing operations were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal year is due primarily to stub period operating costs associated with the data junction operations subsequent to the acquisition date 
sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal primarily due to a full year of combined sales and marketing activities as we increased relative investments in sales and marketing personnel and marketing programs related to the data integration product line acquired in the data junction acquisition 
we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will increase in fiscal year primarily due to an anticipated increase in sales and marketing personnel and marketing programs related to the data integration product line and pervasive postgres and due to the inclusion of compensation costs associated with stock options in accordance with sfas no

research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs 
research and development expenses related to continuing operations were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
research and development expenses increased in dollar amount in fiscal year primarily as a result of costs relating to data junction operations during the stub period 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal year primarily due to a full year of combined research and development activities after the acquisition of data junction 
we anticipate that research and development expenses in fiscal year will increase relative to fiscal year  due to the inclusion of compensation costs associated with stock options in accordance with sfas no 
r  offset partially by a slight decrease in other engineering costs as we continue to leverage our investments in our india development operations 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel salaries and other costs of our finance  human resources and administrative departments 
general and administrative expenses related to continuing operations were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased in dollar amount in fiscal year and decreased in fiscal year primarily as a result of a non recurring charge in fiscal year described in the paragraph below 
we believe our general and administrative expenses in fiscal year will increase relative to fiscal year due to the inclusion of compensation costs associated with stock options in accordance with sfas no

in the second quarter of fiscal  we wrote off related party notes receivable totaling approximately million  included in general and administrative expenses 
these notes receivable  dated july and march  were written off in accordance with the original terms of the note agreements with our former chairman of the board and chief executive officer ron harris 
the terms of the original notes required the forgiveness of the balance of the notes in the event mr

write off of acquired in process research and development 
in connection with the data junction acquisition in december  we recorded a charge of million  or approximately of the total purchase price  for iprd 
the value allocated to the projects identified as iprd was charged to operations during the three months ended december  at the acquisition date  data junction s in process project was release of the data junction integration software product 
at the date of the acquisition  iprd was approximately complete  based upon costs expended to date and estimated costs to complete the project 
release will include significant new code that will result in the creation of an improved architecture designed to solve the high performance integration needs of larger companies and will be much better suited to tackle more complex data and application integration projects 
as of the data junction acquisition date  this technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses 
the technological feasibility of an in process product is established when the enterprise has completed all planning  designing  coding and testing activities necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications 
the value of iprd was determined using an income approach 
this approach takes into consideration earnings remaining after deducting from cash flows related to the in process technology the market rates of return on contributory assets  including assembled workforce  customer accounts and existing technology 
the cash flows are then discounted to present value at an appropriate rate 
discount rates are determined by an analysis of the risks associated with each of the identified intangible assets 
given the riskier nature of the cash flows related to the iprd  a higher discount was warranted  and is based on the cost of equity plus basis points 
the resulting cash flows attributable to the iprd were discounted at a discount rate of 
the resulting net cash flows to which this discount rate was applied are based on management s estimates of revenues  operating expenses  and income taxes from such acquired technology 
many of the features of release of the data junction integration software project have now been released in the form of various add on products to core data junction technology 
some of the risks and uncertainties inherent in the estimated costs to complete the project and the attainment of completion  include  but are not limited to  the difficulty of predicting the duration of product development and the risks that changes in the product requirements will result in unexpected redesign activity 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes related to continuing operations was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes on our foreign operations 
income from us operations has been offset by net operating losses carried forward from previous years 
based on a number of factors  we believe that it is more likely than not  that a substantial amount of our deferred tax assets may not be realized 
accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset due to uncertainties regarding the realization of deferred tax assets based on the uncertainty of future earnings and risks associated with business combinations 
we expect to continue to incur foreign taxes associated with our international operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our provision for income taxes 
gain from discontinued operations 
gain from discontinued operations in fiscal was million and is the result of a reduction in the future liabilities of the discontinued operations following the partial termination of an office lease on favorable economic terms

liquidity and capital resources cash provided by continuing operations was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
cash provided by continuing operations decreased slightly from fiscal to despite an increase in income from continuing operations in fiscal  primarily due to an increase in current assets  partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue 
cash provided by continuing operations decreased from fiscal to primarily due to decreased net income  offset partially by an increase in non cash amortization of acquisition related intangible assets  and the payment of a lease termination fee of million in the quarter ended september  we used million  net of million of cash held by data junction at the time of closing of the transaction  and issued million shares of pervasive common stock to acquire the outstanding shares of data junction  including certain acquisition related costs

in addition  we purchased property and equipment totaling approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
this property consisted primarily of computer hardware and software for general upgrade requirements in fiscal  and as well as an upgrade to the front office system in and we expect that our capital expenditures in the next fiscal year will be consistent with fiscal as a result of specific capital projects anticipated to upgrade additional front and back office systems 
in july  we announced the authorization of a new million stock repurchase plan which became effective upon expiration of the previous plan on july  during fiscal year  we repurchased  shares of common stock at a cost of approximately million

the lease agreement replaced our prior lease with the landlord which was terminated on september  we paid the landlord million in satisfaction of our obligations under the original lease 
the cancellation fee was previously accrued and is reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet as of june  under the heading deferred rent and lease related accruals 
we are exploring new opportunities to build  license or acquire products and services for introduction to and through our expansive worldwide channel

 accounting for stock based compensation  and related implementation guidance 
the pronouncement is effective for the company for interim and annual periods beginning after june  under this pronouncement  stock based compensation to employees is required to be recognized as a charge to the statement of operations and such charge is to be measured according to the fair value of the stock options 
in the absence of an observable market price for the stock awards  the fair value of the stock options would be based upon a valuation methodology that takes into consideration various factors  including the exercise price of the option  the expected term of the option  the current price of the underlying shares  the expected volatility of the underlying share price  the expected dividends on the underlying shares and the risk free interest rate 
sfas no 
r permits adoption using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning on the effective date based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and based on sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that remain unvested on the effective date or a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method  but also permits entities to restate all periods presented or prior interim periods of the year of adoption based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures 
we will adopt the delayed provisions of sfas r during the first quarter of our fiscal year  utilizing the modified prospective method 
we expect to continue to grant stock based compensation to employees 
our current policy is to not expense share based compensation  however  we do disclose the effect of this item as currently required by sfas  see note summary of significant accounting policies stock based compensation 
we expect the adoption of sfas r will have a significant impact on our results of operations  but we do not expect such adoption to have a significant impact on our financial position or liquidity

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the majority of our operations are based in the united states and  accordingly  the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
however  we do have foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
currently  we have operations in japan  belgium  germany  france  england and india and conduct transactions in the local currency of each location

the impact of fluctuations in the relative value of all other currencies for fiscal  and was not material 
we monitor our foreign currency exposure and  from time to time  will attempt to reduce exposure through hedging 
gains and losses on foreign currency hedging were not material to the consolidated financial statements for fiscal years ended june   and as such hedging activities were minimal 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our cash and marketable securities investments  however  this risk is limited as our investment policy requires us to invest in short term securities and maintain an average maturity of one year or less
