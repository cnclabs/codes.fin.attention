overview the company designs  develops and markets athletic footwear for high performance sports use  fitness activities and casual wear under the k swiss brand  and also designs and manufactures footwear under the royal elastics brand 
royal elastics is our wholly owned subsidiary 
the categories of footwear we sell is explained in more detail in item  under the subheading  products 
we market our products in the united states through our sales executives and independent sales representatives primarily to a limited number of specialty athletic footwear stores  pro shops  sporting good stores and department stores 
we also sell our products through our website and to a number of foreign distributors 
in  approximately of our footwear products were manufactured in china 
we have no long term manufacturing agreements  but we believe that our relationships with our producers are satisfactory and that we will have the ability to develop alternative sources for our footwear 
our operations could  however  be materially and adversely affected if a substantial delay occurred in locating and obtaining alternative producers 
because we record revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of products 
our total revenues increased in from  due to an increase in the volume of footwear sold and an increase in the average underlying wholesale price  and our overall gross profit margins  as a percentage of revenues  were and in and  respectively 
likewise  our overall selling  general and administrative expenses also increased to of revenues in from of revenues in at december   our total futures orders with start ship dates from january through june were  a decrease of from the comparable period of the prior year 
of this amount  domestic futures orders were  a decrease of  and international futures orders were  an increase of 
notwithstanding the foregoing  we recognize that the athletic footwear industry is highly competitive 
each of the largest makers of footwear have substantially greater financial  distribution and marketing resources as well as greater brand awareness than us 
in  our largest single marketing expenditure was television 
our marketing campaign was run mainly on network and cable television  and was supported by sports  music and general interest fashion magazines 
our independent sales representatives sold to approximately  separate accounts as of december  down from  as of december  
internationally  by the end of  we were working through international subsidiaries and distributors to market our products in potentially countries 
also  during  the foot locker group of stores and its affiliates accounted for approximately of total revenues 
in  we had a net cash inflow of approximately  from continuing operating activities and a net cash outflow from investing activities due to the net purchase of property  plant and equipment 
we anticipate future cash needs for principal repayments required pursuant to any borrowings under our lines of credit and  depending on future growth  additional funds may be required by operating activities 

table of contents at december  we had  of debt and there was no debt outstanding at december  excluding outstanding letters of credit of  and  at december  and  respectively  and our working capital increased  to approximately  at december  from  at december  in december  pursuant to the american jobs creation act of  we repatriated dividends of  related to foreign subsidiary earnings which were not considered indefinitely invested 
we will receive an dividends received deduction for eligible dividends  resulting in a lower effective tax rate 
we will use these funds on qualified expenditures in the united states in accordance with our approved domestic reinvestment plan 
on october   our board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program to repurchase up to an additional  shares of class a common stock from time to time on the open market 
this program was adopted because we believe repurchasing our shares can be a good use of excess cash 
at december   there remains authorization to repurchase approximately  shares under this stock repurchase program 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note a to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the carrying value of inventories  realizability of outstanding accounts receivable  sales returns and allowances  and the provision for income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
in the past  actual results have not been materially different from our estimates 
however  results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following as critical accounting policies  based on the significant judgments and estimates used in determining the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we record revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  based on the terms of sale 
title passes generally upon shipment 
in some instances  we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer 
in these cases  we recognize revenue when the product is delivered to the customer 
our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks 
as part of our revenue recognition policy  we record the estimated income reductions from estimated sales returns and allowances 
we base our estimates on historical rates of returns and allowances 
however  actual returns and allowances in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates 
if actual or expected future returns and allowances were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established  we would record a reduction or increase in the period in which we made such determination 

table of contents accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate potential losses based on our knowledge of the financial condition of certain customers  as well as an assessment of the overall conditions at retail 
historically  losses have been within our expectations 
if the financial condition of our customers were to change  adjustments may be required to these estimates 
furthermore  we provide for estimated losses resulting from differences that arise from the gross carrying value of our receivables and the amounts which customers estimate are owed to us 
the settlement or resolution of these differences could result in future changes to these estimates 
inventory reserves we also make ongoing estimates relating to the market value of inventories  based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value 
this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated market value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales 
other contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships  product liability claims  trademark rights  and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgment about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
currently  we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
however  if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims  we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred

royal elastics brand revenues increased to  in domestic from  in domestic 
we believe that the athletic and casual footwear industry experiences seasonal fluctuations  due to increased domestic sales during certain selling seasons  including easter  back to school and the year end holiday seasons 
we present full line offerings for the easter and back to school seasons  for delivery during the first and third quarters  respectively  but not for the year end holiday season 
at december   domestic and international futures orders with start ship dates from january through june were approximately  and  respectively  lower and higher  respectively  than such orders were at december  for start ship dates of the comparable period of the prior year 
these orders are not necessarily indicative of revenues for subsequent periods because the mix of future and at once orders can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year and the rate of customer order cancellations can also vary from quarter to quarter and year to year 
overall gross profit margins  as a percentage of revenues  were in and in gross profit margin for was affected by product mix changes  international sales becoming a larger portion of revenues and changes in our at once business

legal expenses decreased for the year ended december   as a result of the defense and settlement of two lawsuits during the year ended december  corporate expenses of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  are included in selling  general and administrative expenses

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the potential change in an instrument s value caused by  for example  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
our primary market risk exposure is the risk of unfavorable 
table of contents movements in exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro 
monitoring and managing these risks is a continual process carried out by senior management  which reviews and approves our risk management policies 
market risk is managed based on an ongoing assessment of trends in foreign exchange rates and economic developments  giving consideration to possible effects on both total return and reported earnings 
foreign exchange rate risk sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  which are primarily sales to customers in europe  expose the company to market risk from material movements in foreign exchange rates between the us dollar and the foreign currency 
the company s historical primary risk exposures have been from changes in the rates between the us dollar and the euro 
this trend is expected to continue 
in  the company entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to exchange euros for us dollars and pounds sterling for euros 
the extent to which forward foreign exchange contracts are used is modified periodically in response to management s estimate of market conditions and the terms and length of specific sales contracts 
the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts in order to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and not to engage in currency speculation 
the use of derivative financial instruments allows the company to reduce its exposure to the risk that the eventual net cash inflow resulting from the sale of products to foreign customers will be materially affected by changes in exchange rates 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the forward foreign exchange contracts are designated for firmly committed or forecasted sales 
these contracts are generally expected to occur in less than one year 
the forward foreign exchange contracts generally require the company to exchange euros for us dollars or pounds sterling for euros at maturity  at rates agreed at the inception of the contracts 
the counterparties to derivative transactions are major financial institutions with investment grade or better credit ratings  however  the company is exposed to credit risk with these institutions 
the credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should these counterparties fail to perform as contracted 
at december   forward foreign exchange contacts with a notional value of  were outstanding to exchange various currencies principally us dollars and euros with maturities ranging from january to august to sell the equivalent of approximately  in foreign currencies at contracted rates and to buy  at contracted rates 
these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges 
as of december   assets of  and liabilities of  have been recorded for the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts 
realized gains of  from cash flow hedges were recorded in cost of goods sold during the year ended december  realized gains of  were recorded on the cash flow hedges in selling  general and administrative expenses due to hedge ineffectiveness during the year ended december  the company did not enter into any derivative financial instruments during and did not have any derivative financial instruments outstanding at december  the company does not anticipate any material adverse effect on its operations or financial position relating to these forward foreign exchange contracts 
based on the company s overall currency rate exposure at december   a change in currency rates would not have had a material effect on the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of the company 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its short term borrowings on its working capital lines of credit 
a change in interest rates would not have had a material effect on the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of the company 

table of contents inflation we believe that distributors of footwear in the higher priced end of the footwear market  including ours  are able to adjust their prices in response to an increase in direct and general and administrative expenses  without a significant loss in sales 
accordingly  to date  inflation and changing prices have not had a material adverse effect on our revenues or earnings
