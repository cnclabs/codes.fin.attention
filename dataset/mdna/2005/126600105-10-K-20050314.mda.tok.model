employees at december   we employed persons  on a full time and on a part time basis 
we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory 
competition the banking and financial services industry is highly competitive 
the increasingly competitive environment is a result primarily of changes in regulation  changes in technology and product delivery systems  and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers 
we compete for loans  deposits  and customers with other commercial banks  savings and loan associations  securities and brokerage companies  mortgage companies  insurance companies  finance companies  money market funds  credit unions  and other nonbank financial service providers 
many of our competitors are much larger in total assets and capitalization  have greater access to capital markets and offer a broader range of financial services than we do 
economic conditions  government policies  legislation  and regulation our profitability  like most financial institutions  is primarily dependent on interest rate differentials 
in general  the difference between the interest rates paid by us on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and other borrowings  and the interest rates received by us on our interest earning assets  such as loans extended to its clients and securities held in its investment portfolio  comprise the major portion of our earnings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  such as inflation  recession and unemployment  monetary and fiscal policy as described below  and the impact which future changes in domestic and foreign economic conditions might have on us cannot be predicted 
our business is also influenced by the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the policies of regulatory agencies  particularly the board of governors of the federal reserve system the frb 
the frb implements national monetary policies with objectives such as curbing inflation and combating recession through its open market operations in us government securities  by adjusting the required level of reserves for depository institutions subject to its reserve requirements  and by varying the target federal funds and discount rates applicable to borrowings by depository institutions 
the actions of the frb in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments  and deposits and also affect interest rates earned on interest earning assets and paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the nature and impact on us of any future changes in monetary and fiscal policies cannot be predicted 
from time to time  legislation  as well as regulations  are enacted which have the effect of increasing the cost of doing business  limiting or expanding permissible activities  or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial services providers 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks  bank holding companies  and other financial institutions and financial services providers are frequently made by the us congress  by the state legislature  and various regulatory agencies 
this legislation may change banking statutes and our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways 
if enacted  such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business  limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks  savings associations  credit unions  and other financial institutions 
we cannot predict whether any of this potential legislation will be enacted  and if enacted  the effect that it  or any implementing regulations  would have on our financial condition or results of operations 
supervision and regulation general bank holding companies and banks are extensively regulated under both federal and state law 
this regulation is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance fund and not for the benefit of our shareholders 
set forth below is a summary description of the material laws and regulations which relate to our operations 
the description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable laws and regulations 
cvb as a bank holding company  we are subject to regulation and examination by the frb under the bank holding company act of  as amended the bhca 
we are required to file with the frb periodic reports and such additional information as the frb may require 
recent changes to the bank holding company rating system emphasize risk management and evaluation of the potential impact of non depository entities on safety and soundness 
the frb may require that we terminate an activity or terminate control of or liquidate or divest certain subsidiaries  affiliates or investments when the frb believes the activity or the control of the subsidiary or affiliate constitutes a significant risk to the financial safety  soundness or stability of any of its banking subsidiaries 
the frb also has the authority to regulate provisions of certain bank holding company debt  including the authority to impose interest ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt 
under certain circumstances  we must file written notice and obtain frb approval prior to purchasing or redeeming its equity securities 
further  we are required by the frb to maintain certain levels of capital 
see capital standards 
we are required to obtain prior frb approval for the acquisition of more than of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities or substantially all of the assets of any bank or bank holding company 
prior frb approval is also required for the merger or consolidation of cvb and another bank holding company 
we are prohibited by the bhca  except in certain statutorily prescribed instances  from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the outstanding voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking  managing or controlling banks  or furnishing services to its subsidiaries 
however  subject to the prior frb approval  we may engage in any  or acquire shares of companies engaged in  activities that the frb deems to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto 
it is the policy of the frb that each bank holding company serves as a source of financial and managerial strength to our subsidiary bank and may not conduct operations in an unsafe or unsound manner 
in addition  it is the frb s policy that a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary bank during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary bank 
a bank holding company s failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the frb to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of frb regulations or both 
we are also a bank holding company within the meaning of section of the california financial code 
as such  cvb and its subsidiaries are subject to examination by  and may be required to file reports with  the california department of financial institutions dfi 
our securities are registered with the securities and exchange commission under the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
as such  we are subject to the information  proxy solicitation  insider trading  corporate governance  and other requirements and restrictions of the exchange act 
the bank as a california chartered bank  the bank is subject to primary supervision  periodic examination  and regulation by the dfi and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  as well as certain regulations promulgated by the frb 
if  as a result of an examination of the bank  the fdic or dfi determines that the financial condition  capital resources  asset quality  earnings prospects  management  liquidity  or other aspects of our operations are unsatisfactory or that we are violating or have violated any law or regulation  various remedies are available to the fdic 
such remedies include the power to enjoin unsafe or unsound practices  to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice  to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced  to direct an increase in capital  to restrict our growth  to assess civil monetary penalties  to remove officers and directors  and ultimately to terminate our deposit insurance  which would result in a revocation of the bank s charter 
the dfi also possesses broad powers to take corrective and other supervisory actions to resolve the problems of california state chartered banks 
these enforcement powers include cease and desist orders  the imposition of fines  the ability to take possession of a bank and the ability to close and liquidate a bank 
because california permits commercial banks chartered by the state to engage in any activity permissible for national banks  we can form subsidiaries to engage in expanded financial activities  to the same extent as a national bank 
however  in order to form a financial subsidiary  we must be well capitalized and would be subject to the same capital deduction  risk management and affiliate transaction rules as applicable to national banks 
generally  a financial subsidiary is permitted to engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental thereto  even though they are not permissible for the national bank itself 
the definition of financial in nature includes  among other items  underwriting  dealing in or making a market in securities  including  for example  distributing shares of mutual funds 
the subsidiary may not  however  engage as principal in underwriting insurance  issue annuities or engage in real estate development or investment or merchant banking 
the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act of addresses accounting oversight and corporate governance matters  including the prohibition of accounting firms from providing various types of consulting services to public clients and requiring accounting firms to rotate partners among public client assignments every five years  increased penalties for financial crimes and forfeiture of executive bonuses in certain circumstances  required executive certification of financial presentations  enhanced disclosure of controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting  increased requirements for board audit committees and their members  enhanced controls on  and reporting of  insider trading  and statutory separations between investment bankers and analysts 
the new legislation and its implementing regulations will result in increased costs of compliance  including certain outside professional costs 
to date  these costs  including allocated time of our associates that were performing other tasks  is approximately per share before taxes 
usa patriot act of the usa patriot act of and its implementing regulations significantly expanded the anti money laundering and financial transparency laws 
under the usa patriot act  financial institutions are subject to prohibitions regarding specified financial transactions and account relationships as well as enhanced due diligence and know your customer standards in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers 
for example  the enhanced due diligence policies  procedures  and controls generally require financial institutions to take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and report any suspicious transaction  to ascertain the identity of the nominal and beneficial owners of  and the source of funds deposited into  each account as needed to guard against money laundering and report any suspicious transactions  to ascertain for any foreign bank  the shares of which are not publicly traded  the identity of the owners of the foreign bank  and the nature and extent of the ownership interest of each such owner  and to ascertain whether any foreign bank provides correspondent accounts to other foreign banks and  if so  the identity of those foreign banks and related due diligence information 
under the usa patriot act  financial institutions are required to establish and maintain anti money laundering programs which included the establishment of a customer identification program  the development of internal policies  procedures  and controls  the designation of a compliance officer  an ongoing employee training program  and an independent audit function to test the programs 
we have implemented comprehensive policies and procedures to address the requirements of the usa patriot act 
merchant banking restrictions we have determined that it is not beneficial at this time for us to become a financial holding company and enter into merchant banking activities  though we could do so in the future 
consumer protection laws and regulations the bank regulatory agencies are focusing greater attention on compliance with consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations 
examination and enforcement have become more intense in nature  and insured institutions have been advised to monitor carefully compliance with such laws and regulations 
the bank is subject to many federal consumer protection statutes and regulations  some of which are discussed below 
the community reinvestment act cra is intended to encourage insured depository institutions  while operating safely and soundly  to help meet the credit needs of their communities 
the cra specifically directs the federal regulatory agencies  in examining insured depository institutions  to assess a bank s record of helping meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods  consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
the cra further requires the agencies to take a financial institution s record of meeting its community credit needs into account when evaluating applications for  among other things  domestic branches  mergers or acquisitions  or holding company formations 
the agencies use the cra assessment factors in order to provide a rating to the financial institution 
the ratings range from a high of outstanding to a low of substantial noncompliance 
in its last examination for cra compliance  as of february   the bank was rated satisfactory 
the fair credit reporting act  as amended by the fair and accurate credit transactions act  or fact  requires financial firms to help deter identity theft  including developing appropriate fraud response programs  and give consumers more control of their credit data 
it also reauthorizes a federal ban on state laws that interfere with corporate credit granting and marketing practices 
in connection with fact  financial institution regulatory agencies proposed rules that would prohibit an institution from using certain information about a consumer it received from an affiliate to make a solicitation to the consumer  unless the consumer has been notified and given a chance to opt out of such solicitations 
a consumer s election to opt out would be applicable for at least five years 
the check clearing for the st century act  or check  facilitates check truncation and electronic check exchange by authorizing a new negotiable instrument called a substitute check  which is the legal equivalent of an original check 
check  effective october   does not require banks to create substitute checks or accept checks electronically  however  it does require banks to accept a legally equivalent substitute check in place of an original 
the equal credit opportunity act  or ecoa  generally prohibits discrimination in any credit transaction  whether for consumer or business purposes  on the basis of race  color  religion  national origin  sex  marital status  age except in limited circumstances  receipt of income from public assistance programs  or good faith exercise of any rights under the consumer credit protection act 
the truth in lending act  or tila  is designed to ensure that credit terms are disclosed in a meaningful way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably 
as a result of the tila  all creditors must use the same credit terminology to express rates and payments  including the annual percentage rate  the finance charge  the amount financed  the total of payments and the payment schedule  among other things 
the fair housing act  or fh act  regulates many practices  including making it unlawful for any lender to discriminate in its housing related lending activities against any person because of race  color  religion  national origin  sex  handicap or familial status 
a number of lending practices have been found by the courts to be  or may be considered  illegal under the fh act  including some that are not specifically mentioned in the fh act itself 
the home mortgage disclosure act  or hmda  grew out of public concern over credit shortages in certain urban neighborhoods and provides public information that will help show whether financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located 
the hmda also includes a fair lending aspect that requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti discrimination statutes 
the term predatory lending  much like the terms safety and soundness and unfair and deceptive practices  is far reaching and covers a potentially broad range of behavior 
as such  it does not lend itself to a concise or a comprehensive definition 
but typically predatory lending involves at least one  and perhaps all three  of the following elements making unaffordable loans based on the assets of the borrower rather than on the borrower s ability to repay an obligation asset based lending inducing a borrower to refinance a loan repeatedly in order to charge high points and fees each time the loan is refinanced loan flipping engaging in fraud or deception to conceal the true nature of the loan obligation from an unsuspecting or unsophisticated borrower 
frb regulations aimed at curbing such lending significantly widen the pool of high cost home secured loans covered by the home ownership and equity protection act of  a federal law that requires extra disclosures and consumer protections to borrowers 
lenders that violate the rules face cancellation of loans and penalties equal to the finance charges paid 
finally  the real estate settlement procedures act  or respa  requires lenders to provide borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements 
also  respa prohibits certain abusive practices  such as kickbacks  and places limitations on the amount of escrow accounts 
penalties under the above laws may include fines  reimbursements and other penalties 
due to heightened regulatory concern related to compliance with the cra  tila  fh act  ecoa  hmda and respa generally  the bank may incur additional compliance costs or be required to expend additional funds for investments in its local community 
privacy federal banking rules limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties 
pursuant to these rules  financial institutions must provide initial notices to customers about their privacy policies  describing the conditions under which they may disclose nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties and affiliates  annual notices of their privacy policies to current customers  and a reasonable method for customers to opt out of disclosures to nonaffiliated third parties 
these privacy provisions affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors 
we have implemented our privacy policies in accordance with the law 
in recent years  a number of states have implemented their own versions of privacy laws 
for example  in  california adopted standards that are tougher than federal law  allowing bank customers the opportunity to bar financial companies from sharing information with their affiliates 
as a california charted bank  we are required to follow these more restrictive standards 
interagency guidance on response programs to protect against identity theft on august   the federal bank and thrift regulatory agencies requested public comment on proposed guidance that would require financial institutions to develop programs to respond to incidents of unauthorized access to customer information  including procedures for notifying customers under certain circumstances 
the proposed guidance interprets previously issued interagency customer information security guidelines that require financial institutions to implement information security programs designed to protect their customers information  and describes the components of a response program and sets a standard for providing notice to customers affected by unauthorized access to or use of customer information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to those customers  thereby reducing the risk of losses due to fraud or identity theft 
we are not able at this time to determine the impact of any such proposed guidance on our financial condition or results of operation 
dividends and other transfers of funds dividends from the bank constitute the principal source of income to cvb 
cvb is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank 
a frb policy statement on the payment of cash dividends states that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the holding company s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the holding company s capital needs  asset quality and overall financial condition 
the frb also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends 
furthermore  under the federal prompt corrective action regulations  the frb may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company s bank subsidiary is classified as undercapitalized 
see prompt corrective action and other enforcement mechanisms below 
the bank is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends to cvb 
under such restrictions  the amount available for payment of dividends to cvb by the bank totaled million at december  in addition  the bank s regulators have the authority to prohibit the bank from paying dividends  depending upon the bank s financial condition  if such payment is deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 
extension of credit to insiders and transactions with affiliates the federal reserve act and frb regulation o place limitations and conditions on loans or extensions of credit to a bank s or bank holding company s executive officers  directors and principal shareholders ie  in most cases  those persons who own  control or have power to vote more than of any class of voting securities  any company controlled by any such executive officer  director or shareholder  or any political or campaign committee controlled by such executive officer  director or principal shareholder 
loans and leases extended to any of the above persons must comply with loan to one borrower limits  require prior full board approval when aggregate extensions of credit to the person exceed specified amounts  must be made on substantially the same terms including interest rates and collateral as  and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than  those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non insiders  and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 
in addition  regulation o provides that the aggregate limit on extensions of credit to all insiders of a bank as a group cannot exceed the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus 
regulation o also prohibits a bank from paying an overdraft on an account of an executive officer or director  except pursuant to a written pre authorized interest bearing extension of credit plan that specifies a method of repayment or a written pre authorized transfer of funds from another account of the officer or director at the bank 
the bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on any extensions of credit to  or the issuance of a guarantee or letter of credit on behalf of  cvb and other affiliates  the purchase of  or investments in  stock or other securities thereof  the taking of such securities as collateral for loans  and the purchase of assets of cvb and other affiliates 
such restrictions prevent cvb and other affiliates from borrowing from the bank unless the loans are secured by marketable obligations of designated amounts 
further  such secured loans and investments by the bank to or in cvb or to or in any other affiliates are limited  individually  to of the bank s capital and surplus as defined by federal regulations  and such secured loans and investments are limited  in the aggregate  to of our capital and surplus 
some of the entities included in the definition of an affiliate are parent companies  sister banks  sponsored and advised companies  investment companies whereby the bank s affiliate serves as investment advisor  and financial subsidiaries of the bank 
additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates may be imposed on us under the prompt corrective action provisions of federal law 
see prompt corrective action and other enforcement mechanisms 
capital standards the federal banking agencies have adopted risk based minimum capital guidelines intended to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets and transactions which are recorded as off balance sheet items 
under these guidelines  nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages  which range from for assets with low credit risk federal banking agencies  to for assets with relatively high credit risk 
the risk based capital ratio is determined by classifying assets and certain off balance sheet financial instruments into weighted categories  with higher levels of capital being required for those categories perceived as representing greater risk 
under the capital guidelines  a banking organization s total capital is divided into tiers 
tier i capital consists of common equity  qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock  a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries including trust preferred securities  less goodwill and certain other intangible assets 
not more than of qualifying tier i capital may consist of trust preferred securities 
tier ii capital consists of hybrid capital instruments  perpetual debt  mandatory convertible debt securities  a limited amount of subordinated debt  preferred stock that does not qualify as tier i capital  a limited amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses and a limited amount of unrealized holding gains on equity securities 
tier iii capital consists of qualifying unsecured subordinated debt 
the sum of tier ii and tier iii capital may not exceed the amount of tier i capital 
the guidelines require a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk adjusted assets of and a minimum ratio of tier i capital to risk adjusted assets of 
in addition to the risk based guidelines  federal banking regulators require banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of tier i capital to total assets  referred to as the leverage ratio 
for a banking organization rated in the highest of the five categories used by regulators to rate banking organizations  the minimum leverage ratio of tier i capital to total assets must be 
in addition to these uniform risk based capital guidelines and leverage ratios that apply across the industry  the regulators have the discretion to set individual minimum capital requirements for specific institutions at rates significantly above the minimum guidelines and ratios 
a bank that does not achieve and maintain the required capital levels may be issued a capital directive  by the fdic  to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels 
the following table presents the amounts of regulatory capital and the capital ratios for the company  compared to its minimum regulatory capital requirements as of december  as of december  actual required excess amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio amounts in thousands leverage ratio tier risk based ratio total risk based ratio the following table presents the amounts of regulatory capital and the capital ratios for the bank  compared to its minimum regulatory capital requirements as of december  as of december  actual required excess amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio amounts in thousands leverage ratio tier risk based ratio total risk based ratio in addition  federal banking regulators may set capital requirements higher than the minimums described above for financial institutions whose circumstances warrant it 
for example  a financial institution experiencing or anticipating significant growth may be expected to maintain capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets 
on march   the frb adopted a final rule that retains trust preferred securities in the tier capital of bank holding companies  but with stricter quantitative limits and clearer qualitative standards 
under the rule  after a five year transition period  the aggregate amount of trust preferred securities and certain other capital elements will be limited to percent of tier capital elements  net of goodwill  less any associated deferred tax liability 
the amount of trust preferred securities and certain other elements in excess of the limit could be included in tier capital  subject to restrictions 
internationally active bank holding companies would generally be expected to limit trust preferred securities and certain other capital elements to percent of tier capital elements  net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability 
in the last five years before maturity  the outstanding amount must be excluded from tier capital and included in tier capital 
we are currently evaluating this new regulation  but do not expect this rule to have a materially adverse effect on our capital positions 
prompt corrective action and other enforcement mechanisms federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take corrective and other supervisory action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions  including but not limited to those institutions that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios 
each federal banking agency has promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed  based on its capital ratios well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
at december   both the bank and cvb exceeded the required ratios for classification as well capitalized 
an institution that  based upon its capital levels  is classified as well capitalized  adequately capitalized  or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency  after notice and opportunity for hearing  determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment 
at each successive lower capital category  an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions 
the federal banking agencies  however  may not treat a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized unless its capital ratio actually warrants such treatment 
in addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions  commercial banking organizations may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law  rule  regulation  or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency 
finally  pursuant to an interagency agreement  the fdic can examine any institution that has a substandard regulatory examination score or is considered undercapitalized without the express permission of the institution s primary regulator 
safety and soundness standards the federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines designed to assist the federal banking agencies in identifying and addressing potential safety and soundness concerns before capital becomes impaired 
the guidelines set forth operational and managerial standards relating to i internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems  ii loan documentation  iii credit underwriting  iv asset growth  v earnings  and vi compensation  fees and benefits 
in addition  the federal banking agencies have also adopted safety and soundness guidelines with respect to asset quality and earnings standards 
these guidelines provide six standards for establishing and maintaining a system to identify problem assets and prevent those assets from deteriorating 
under these standards  an insured depository institution should i conduct periodic asset quality reviews to identify problem assets  ii estimate the inherent losses in problem assets and establish reserves that are sufficient to absorb estimated losses  iii compare problem asset totals to capital  iv take appropriate corrective action to resolve problem assets  v consider the size and potential risks of material asset concentrations  and vi provide periodic asset quality reports with adequate information for management and the board of directors to assess the level of asset risk 
these new guidelines also set forth standards for evaluating and monitoring earnings and for ensuring that earnings are sufficient for the maintenance of adequate capital and reserves 
premiums for deposit insurance through the bank insurance fund bif  the fdic insures the deposits of the bank up to prescribed limits for each depositor 
the amount of fdic assessments paid by each bif member institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other factors 
specifically  the assessment rate is based on the institution s capitalization risk category and supervisory subgroup category 
an institution s capitalization risk category is based on the fdic s determination of whether the institution is well capitalized  adequately capitalized or less than adequately capitalized 
an institution s supervisory subgroup category is based on the fdic s assessment of the financial condition of the institution and the probability that fdic intervention or other corrective action will be required 
fdic insured depository institutions pay an assessment rate equal to the rate assessed on deposits insured by the savings association insurance fund saif 
the assessment rate currently ranges from zero to cents per of domestic deposits 
the fdic may increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule on a semi annual basis 
due to continued growth in deposits and some recent bank failures  the bif is nearing its minimum ratio of of insured deposits as mandated by law 
if the ratio drops below  it is likely the fdic will be required to assess premiums on all banks 
any increase in assessments or the assessment rate could have a material adverse effect on the company s earnings  depending on the amount of the increase 
furthermore  the fdic is authorized to raise insurance premiums under certain circumstances 
the fdic is authorized to terminate a depository institution s deposit insurance upon a finding by the fdic that the institution s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule  regulation  order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution s regulatory agency 
the termination of deposit insurance for the company s subsidiary depository institutions could have a material adverse effect on the company s earnings 
all fdic insured depository institutions must pay an annual assessment to provide funds for the payment of interest on bonds issued by the financing corporation  a federal corporation chartered under the authority of the federal housing finance board 
the bonds  commonly referred to as fico bonds  were issued to capitalize the federal savings and loan insurance corporation 
the fdic established the fico assessment rates effective for the first half of at approximately cents for each of assessable deposits 
the fico assessments are adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in the assessment bases of the fdic s insurance funds and do not vary depending on a depository institution s capitalization or supervisory evaluations 
interstate banking and branching banks have the ability  subject to certain state restrictions  to acquire by acquisition or merger branches outside their home state 
the establishment of new interstate branches is also possible in those states with laws that expressly permit it 
interstate branches are subject to certain laws of the states in which they are located 
competition may increase further as banks branch across state lines and enter new markets 
federal home loan bank system the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank of san francisco 
among other benefits  each fhlb serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region 
each fhlb is financed primarily from the sale of consolidated obligations of the fhlb system 
each fhlb makes available loans or advances to its members in compliance with the policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the individual fhlb 
as an fhlb member  we are required to own capital stock in the fhlb in an amount equal to the greater of of its aggregate outstanding principal amount of its residential mortgage loans  home purchase contracts and similar obligations at the beginning of each calendar year  or of its fhlb advances or borrowings 
at december   we were in compliance with the stock requirements 
federal reserve system the federal reserve board requires all depository institutions to maintain non interest bearing reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts primarily checking  now  and super now checking accounts and non personal time deposits 
at december   we were in compliance with these requirements 
non bank subsidiaries the company s non bank subsidiaries also are subject to regulation by the frb and other applicable federal and state agencies 
other non bank subsidiaries of the company are subject to the laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in which they conduct business 
risk factors that may affect future results in addition to other information contained in this report  the following discusses certain factors which may adversely affect our business financial results and operations and should be considered in evaluating the company 
our southern california business focus and economic conditions in southern california could adversely affect our operations 
our operations are located in san bernardino county  riverside county  orange county  fresno county  tulare county  kern county  and the eastern portion of los angeles county in southern california 
as a result of this geographic concentration  our results depend largely upon economic conditions in these areas 
a deterioration in economic conditions or a natural or manmade disaster in our market area or in california generally could have a material adverse impact on the quality of our loan portfolio  the demand for our products and services  and our financial condition and results of operations 
changes in market interest rates could adversely affect our earnings 
our earnings are impacted by changing interest rates 
changes in interest rates impact the level of loans  deposits and investments  the credit profile of existing loans and the rates received on loans and securities and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings 
significant fluctuations in interest rates may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to government regulations that could limit or restrict our activities  which in turn could adversely impact our operations 
the financial services industry is subject to extensive federal and state supervision and regulation 
significant new laws or changes in existing laws  or repeals of existing laws may cause our results to differ materially 
further  federal monetary policy  particularly as implemented through the federal reserve system  significantly affects credit conditions for us and a material change in these conditions could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
competition may adversely affect our performance 
the banking and financial services businesses in our market areas are highly competitive 
we face competition in attracting deposits and in making loans 
the increasingly competitive environment is a result of changes in regulation  changes in technology and product delivery systems  and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers

if a significant number of borrowers  guarantors and related parties fail to perform as required by the terms of their loans  we will sustain losses 
a significant source of risk arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained because borrowers  guarantors and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans 
we have adopted underwriting and credit monitoring procedures and credit policies  including the establishment and review of the allowance for credit losses  that management believes are appropriate to minimize this risk by assessing the likelihood of nonperformance  tracking loan performance and diversifying our credit portfolio 
these policies and procedures  however  may not prevent unexpected losses that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

after taking into consideration information furnished by counsel  we believe that the ultimate aggregate liability represented thereby  if any  will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in early  we suffered a break in at one of our business financial centers 
the break in resulted in a loss to our customers of items located in their safe deposit boxes 
we had been compensating our customers for their losses with the acknowledgement of our insurance company that they were not confirming or denying coverage to us under our insurance policies 
in early fall  the insurance company ceased approving claims 
over the last quarter of  it became apparent to us that the insurance company would deny coverage of our claims 
therefore  we decided to reserve million as an estimate of the claims yet to be paid 
we are currently determining what legal action to take against the insurance company

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and the results of operations general management s discussion and analysis is written to provide greater detail of the results of operations and the financial condition of cvb financial corp 
and its subsidiaries 
this analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements contained within this report including the notes thereto 
overview we are a bank holding company with one bank subsidiary  citizens business bank 
we have two other active subsidiaries  community trust deed services  which is owned by cvb financial corp 
and golden west enterprises  inc  which is owned by the bank 
we have three other inactive subsidiaries cvb ventures  inc  chino valley bancorp and onb bancorp 
we are also the common stockholder of cvb statutory trust i and cvb statutory trust ii  which were created in december to issue trust preferred securities in order to increase the capital of the company 
we are based in ontario  california in what is known as the inland empire 
our geographical market area encompasses fresno the middle of the central valley in the center of california to laguna beach in orange county in the southern portion of california 
our mission is to offer the finest financial products and services to professionals and businesses in our market area 
our primary source of income is from the interest earned on our loans and investments and our primary area of expense is the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
as such our net income is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on our income statement 
we believe the recent rise in interest rates may relieve some of the pressure on our net interest margin 
we are also subject to competition from other financial institutions  which may affect our pricing of products and services  and the fees and interest rates we can charge on them 
economic conditions in our california service area impact our business 
the economy of this area has not experienced the decline that other areas of the state and country have witnessed during the past few years 
the job market continues to strengthen in the central valley and inland empire 
however  we are still subject to any changes in the economy in our market area 
although we do not provide mortgages on single family residences  we still benefit from construction growth in southern california since we provide construction loans to builders 
southern california is experiencing growth in construction on single family residences and commercial buildings  and our balance sheet at december  reflects that growth from december  over the past few years  we have been active in acquisitions 
since  we have acquired three banks and a leasing company  and we have opened three de novo branches  glendale  bakersfield and fresno 
in we implemented our central valley initiative which is intended to grow our presence in the southern central valley of california 
this area has a large agribusiness economy and fits in well with the agribusiness lending we already have in the bank 
this portion of the state is the largest agricultural area in the nation 
we began this initiative in december of with the opening of our bakersfield business financial center 
we added another de novo branch in fresno in the second quarter of our acquisition of kaweah national bank in september with branches in visalia  tulare  porterville and mcfarland further complimented the initiative 
since  we have also opened three de novo branches 
while we continue to evaluate acquisitions  we intend to focus on organic growth 
the year was a year of organic growth since we made no acquisitions 
our assets grew million or to billion from december  to december  net loans grew million or to billion and deposits grew million or to billion during the same period 
our growth in loans and investments during compared with has allowed our interest income to grow in as compared to the same period in the preceding year even though there was a decline in the interest rate environment between these periods 
we did increase our borrowings from the fhlb in to assist in the growth of investments and the related interest income on these investments 
the result of the increase in loan  investment and deposit balances and overall decline in interest rates resulted in an increase of net interest income to million in from million in however  the decline in interest rates reduced the net interest margin tax equivalent to from in the bank has always had a base of interest free deposits because we specialize in businesses and professionals as deposit customers 
this has allowed us to have a low cost of deposits  currently at for in and  we restructured a portion of our investment portfolio in anticipation of a rising interest rate environment 
this restructuring had the effect of shortening the duration of the portfolio and we realized security gains of million in and million in the purpose of the restructuring was to sell those securities which would not perform well in a rising rate environment 
the shortening in the duration of the portfolio will allow for an increase in cash flow or liquidity so that the reinvestment of the cash flow will occur at higher rates 
during the first quarter of  we wrote down the carrying value of two issues of federal home loan mortgage association preferred stock 
these securities pay dividends based on libor and perform like a bond 
since there was a loss of value that was deemed other than temporary  we charged million against the earnings in the first quarter of to adjust for the impairment of the issues of preferred securities 
this was partially offset by the million in security gains taken in the second quarter we took these gains on short maturity securities before rates rose and the gains disappeared 
in the third quarter of  we sold a building that housed the business financial center and our wealth management group 
we are leasing this space back from the purchaser of the building 
we had a gain of million from this transaction 
under accounting principles  we could only recognize the gain on that portion of the building that we previously leased to third parties in current year income 
this resulted in gain recognition of  in the remaining portion of the gain  million  is being amortized over the lives of the leases we have for the business financial center and the wealth management group 
during the fourth quarter  we acquired a new building for our data center 
we out grew our old data center  which we also owned 
we are in the process of improving the facility and will move to the new location in the second quarter of subsequent to that move  we intend to sell our old data center property 
our total occupancy expense  exclusive of furniture and equipment expense  for the year ended december   was million 
we believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our present purposes 
the company believes that if necessary  it could secure suitable alternative facilities on similar terms without adversely affecting operations
