new accounting standards for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their impact on the company  see the significant accounting policies accounting pronouncements note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  the company selects the principle or method that is appropriate in its specific circumstances 
the company s accounting policies are more fully described in the significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements 
application of these accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or estimation than other accounting policies 
use of estimates in connection with the sale of the company s automotive operations the sale of the company s automotive operations included contract provisions which require estimates to be made in accounting and reporting the impact of the sale 
the most significant of these are estimates of final proceeds  estimates of future payments under provisions of the agreement which require the company to indemnify the buyer upon the occurrence of certain liabilities  the amount of pension obligations and plan assets being transferred to the buyer  the amount of post retirement pension obligations assumed by the buyer  and possible severance obligations for key executives of the automotive operations 
the agreement provides for various post closing adjustments based on differences between estimated amounts of cash  debt and target working capital used at closing and final amounts later agreed to by the parties 
the agreement provides for reporting by the buyer of final amounts in early february with subsequent periods for review by the company and resolution of disputes  if any 
amounts used in determining the gain of the sale of the automotive operations at december  include the final amounts reported by the buyer 
differences  if any  from those amounts and the final payment amounts agreed to by both parties will be reflected as an adjustment to the gain on the sale in the period the final amounts are determined 
the agreement also provides for indemnification of the buyer by the company for all income tax liabilities related to periods prior to closing and for various additional items outlined in the agreement 
indemnity payments would reduce the purchase price and the amount of gain on the sale 
the recorded gain on the sale includes reductions for estimates of the expected tax liabilities and the other potential indemnity items to the extent they are deemed to be probable and estimable at december  where amounts are probable and a range of loss is possible  the company considered whether an amount within the range of outcomes was more likely than other amounts 
if so  the most likely amount was recorded as a reduction of the gain with corresponding liabilities for the future indemnity payments 
if no amount within the range of possible amounts was more likely than other amounts  the company recorded the minimum amount believed to be probable 
the company will reevaluate the probability of indemnity payments being required quarterly and adjustments  if any  to the initial estimates will be reflected as a change in the gain on sale in the periods when revised estimates are determined 
in connection with the divestiture of the automotive operations  defined benefit plans relating to automotive operations were assumed by the buyer except those relating to previously closed automotive plants 
obligations assumed by the buyer consisted of plans established under collective bargaining agreements  all of which related to discrete automotive employee units  which have been separately measured and were transferred to the buyer at closing and obligations relating to active automotive employees and retirees who participated in the company s non bargained defined benefit plan which covered all eligible non bargained employees 
pursuant to terms of the sale  an actuarial determination is to be made of the obligations and assets being split from the company s non bargained plan 
that process is to be completed not later than june following which the computed obligation and plan assets will be transferred to the buyer 
in the interim the company s actuary has provided estimates of the total obligations  computed using the company s accounting methods and actuarial assumptions  and assets to be transferred to the buyer 
the estimated amounts to be transferred to the buyer and amounts for plans to be retained by the company were measured at december  and are reflected in the disclosures contained in footnotes to the financial statements 
actual amounts transferred will be determined at a future date and may differ from these estimates 
as a result  the obligations and assets relating to continuing operations may differ from the amounts shown in the footnotes to the financial statements at december  but will not impact the gain on the sale 
similarly  post retirement benefit obligations relating to the automotive operations sold were transferred to the buyer 
actuarial estimates of the amount of obligation being assumed by the buyer and the remaining obligations of the company are disclosed in the accompanying footnotes to financial statements 
final actuarial determinations will be completed in and may differ from the amounts shown in the footnotes to the financial statements at december  but will not impact the gain on the sale 
under terms of an employment agreement with the president of the automotive operations and terms of a change in control severance pay plan for eight additional key automotive executives  such executives are entitled to specified severance payments if terminated by the buyer within predetermined time periods after the sale 
the company is obligated to pay the severance costs and related excise taxes  if any  if severance occurs on or prior 
table of contents to december  in the case of the automotive operation s president and on or prior to december  for the eight other automotive executives 
the company was required to fund  immediately following the sale  its potential obligation for such severance payments into a rabbi trust with a third party trustee for the possible benefit of these executives 
based on the positions these executives retained after the sale  the ownership interests they acquired as a result of the transaction  and the incentives provided to them by the buyer after the sale  the company does not believe it is presently probable that any of the executives will be terminated within the periods in which it is obligated to pay the severance costs 
accordingly  no accrual for severance has been recorded 
if information becomes known to the company at a later date which indicates severance of one or more of the covered executives is probable within the time period covered by the company  accruals for severance will be required 
certain operating leases related to property and equipment used in the operations of cooper standard automotive were guaranteed by the company 
these guarantees require the company  in the event cooper standard fails to honor its commitments  to satisfy the terms of the lease agreements 
as part of the sale of the automotive operations  the company is seeking releases of those guarantees but to date has been unable to secure releases from certain lessors 
the most significant lease is for a manufacturing facility with a remaining term of years and total remaining payments of approximately million 
other leases cover manufacturing equipment with remaining terms of from less than one year to four years and total remaining payments of approximately  the company does not believe it is presently probable that it will be called upon to make these payments 
accordingly  no accrual for these guarantees has been recorded 
if information becomes known to the company at a later date which indicates its performance under these guarantees is probable  accruals for the obligations will be required 
products liability the company is a defendant in various products liability claims in which individuals involved in vehicle accidents seek damages resulting from allegedly defective tires manufactured by the company 
litigation of this type has increased significantly throughout the tire industry following the firestone tire recall announced in the company accrues costs for products liability at the time a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be estimated 
the company believes the probability of loss can be established and the amount of loss can be estimated only after certain minimum information is available  including verification that company produced products were involved in the incident giving rise to the claim  the condition of the product purported to be involved in the claim  the nature of the incident giving rise to the claim  and the extent of the purported injury or damages 
in cases where such information is known  each products liability claim is evaluated based on its specific facts and circumstances 
a judgment is then made  taking into account the views of counsel and other relevant factors  to determine the requirement for establishment or revision of an accrual for any potential liability 
in most cases  the liability cannot be determined with precision until the claim is resolved 
pursuant to applicable accounting rules  the company accrues the minimum liability for each known claim when the estimated outcome is a range of possible loss and no one amount within that range is more likely than another 
no specific accrual is made for individual unasserted claims or for asserted claims where the minimum information needed to evaluate the probability of a liability is not yet known 
however  an accrual for such claims based  in part  on management s expectations for future litigation activity is maintained 
because of the speculative nature of litigation in the united states  the company does not believe a meaningful aggregate range of potential loss for asserted and unasserted claims can be determined 
the total cost of resolution of such claims  or increase in reserves resulting from greater knowledge of specific facts and circumstances related to such claims  could have a greater impact on the consolidated results of operations and financial position of the company in future periods and  in some periods  could be material 
the company s exposure for each claim occurring prior to april  is limited by the coverage provided by its excess liability insurance program 
the program for that period includes a relatively low per claim retention and a policy year aggregate retention limit on claims arising from occurrences which took place during a particular policy year 
effective april   the company established a new excess liability insurance program 
the new program covers the company s products liability claims occurring on or after april  and is occurrence based insurance coverage which includes an increased per claim retention limit  increased policy limits  and the establishment of a captive insurance company 
premium costs for insurance coverage in excess of the self insured amounts for the first policy year were million higher than under the previous program  the per claim retention limit increased million and the aggregate retention limit was eliminated  while excess liability coverage increased by million 
the program was renewed effective april  with a premium cost increase of less than one percent 
the products liability expense reported by the company includes amortization of insurance premium costs  adjustments to settlement reserves  and legal costs incurred in defending claims against the company offset by recoveries of legal fees 
the company is entitled to reimbursement under certain insurance contracts in place for periods ending prior to april  of legal fees expensed in prior periods based on events occurring in the those periods 
products liability costs totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
recoveries of legal fees were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
policies applicable to claims occurring on april  and thereafter do not provide for recovery of legal fees 
this program was in place for the entire year in and for nine months in  resulting in higher costs during compared to and during compared to income taxes the company is required to make certain estimates and judgments to determine income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments are made in the calculation of tax credits  tax benefits and deductions such as the tax benefit for export sales and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of the 
table of contents recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to tax provisions in subsequent periods 
the company must assess the likelihood that it will be able to recover its deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  the provision for income tax expense must be increased by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that are deemed to be not recoverable 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance against a substantial portion of its net operating losses  capital losses and tax credits at december  as it does not anticipate the utilization of these assets before they expire 
in the event there is a change in circumstances in the future which would affect the utilization of these deferred tax assets  the tax provision in that accounting period would be reduced by the amount of the assets then deemed to be realizable 
in addition  the calculation of the company s tax liabilities involves a degree of uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulations 
the company recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other jurisdictions based on its estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional tax payments are probable 
if  and at the time  the company determines payment of such amounts are not probable  the liability will be reversed and a tax benefit recognized to reduce the provision for income taxes 
the company will record an increase to its provision for income tax expense in the period it determines it is probable that recorded liabilities are less than the ultimate tax assessment 
impairment of long lived assets the company s long lived assets include property  plant and equipment  long term investments  goodwill and other intangible assets 
if an indicator of impairment exists for certain groups of property  plant and equipment or definite lived intangible assets  the company will compare the forecasted undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets to their carrying values 
if the carrying values exceed the undiscounted cash flows  the company then determines the fair values of the assets 
if the carrying values exceed the fair values of the assets  then an impairment charge is recognized for the difference 
during  impairments of million were recorded as part of the company s restructuring expenses related to the discontinuation of its inner tube business 
a decline in the value of the company s investment in rubbernetwork 
com of million was recorded at december  based on the amount to be paid by a potential new consortium member for an equity share equal to the company s share 
the company assesses the potential impairment of its goodwill and other indefinite lived assets at least annually or when events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
the carrying value of these assets is compared to their fair value 
if the carrying values exceed the fair values  then a hypothetical purchase price allocation is computed and the impairment charge  if any  is then recorded 
as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company assessed its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at december  and no impairment was indicated 
the company cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering events 
such events may include  but are not limited to  significant industry or economic trends and strategic decisions made in response to changes in the economic and competitive conditions impacting the company s businesses 
based on current facts  the company believes there is no impairment 
pension and postretirement benefits the company has recorded significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities that are developed from actuarial valuations  primarily for plans in the united states 
the determination of the company s pension liabilities requires key assumptions regarding discount rates used to determine the present value of future benefits payments  expected returns on plan assets  and the rates of future compensation increases 
the discount rate is also significant to the development of other postretirement benefit liabilities 
the company determines these assumptions in consultation with  and after input from  its actuaries 
the discount rate reflects the estimated rate at which the company s pension and other postretirement liabilities could be settled at the end of the year 
when determining the discount rate  the company considers the most recent available interest rates on moody s aa corporate bonds  with maturities of at least twenty years  late in the fourth quarter and then factors into the rate its expectations for change by year end 
the company discounted the expected pension disbursements over the next fifty years using a yield curve based on market data as of december  which validated the present value determined using the single benchmark rate for all years 
based upon this analysis  the company reduced the discount rate used to measure its united states pension and postretirement benefit liabilities to percent at december  from percent at december  the effect of this one quarter percent reduction in the discount rate assumption was to increase the projected benefit obligation at december  which will also result in increases of approximately million in pension expense and approximately  in other postretirement benefits expense during the rate of future compensation increases is used to determine the future benefits to be paid for salaried and non bargained employees  because the amount of a participant s pension is partially attributable to the compensation earned during his or her career 
the rate reflects the company s expectations over time for salary and wage inflation and the impacts of promotions and incentive compensation  which is based on profitability 
the company used percent for the estimated future compensation increases in measuring its united states pension liabilities at december  and december  the assumed long term rate of return on pension plan assets is applied to the market value of plan assets to derive a reduction to pension expense that approximates the expected average rate of asset investment return over ten or more years 
a decrease in the expected long term rate of return will increase pension expense whereas an increase in the expected long term rate will reduce pension 
table of contents expense 
decreases in the level of actual plan assets will serve to increase the amount of pension expense whereas increases in the level of actual plan assets will serve to decrease the amount of pension expense 
any shortfall in the actual return on plan assets from the expected return will increase pension expense in future years due to the amortization of the shortfall whereas any excess in the actual return on plan assets from the expected return will reduce pension expense in future periods due to the amortization of the excess 
the company s investment policy for united states plans assets is to maintain an allocation of percent in equity securities and percent in debt securities 
equity security investments are structured to achieve an equal balance between growth and value stocks 
the company determines the annual rate of return on pension assets by first analyzing the composition of its asset portfolio 
historical rates of return are applied to the portfolio 
this computed rate of return is reviewed by the company s investment advisors and actuaries 
industry comparables and other outside guidance is also considered in the annual selection of the expected rates of return on pension assets 
the actual return on united states pension plans assets approximated percent in and percent in  exceeding the nine percent expected rate of return on plan assets used to derive pension expense 
the higher actual return on plan assets reflects the recovery of the equity markets experienced in and from the depressed levels which have existed since the end of based on recent and projected market and economic conditions  the company maintained its estimate for the expected long term return on its united states plan assets at nine percent  the same assumption used to derive expense 
the company has accumulated net deferred gains and losses resulting from the shortfalls and excesses in actual returns on pension plan assets from expected returns and  in the measurement of pensions liabilities  decreases and increases in the discount rate and the rate of future compensation increases and differences between actuarial assumptions and actual experience totaling million at december  these amounts are being amortized in accordance with the corridor amortization requirements of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  over periods ranging from years to years 
amortization of these net deferred gains and losses was million in and million in the company instituted per participant caps on the amounts of retiree medical benefits it will provide to future retirees at the time it adopted sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  to mitigate the impact of medical cost inflation on the company s retiree medical obligation 
the caps do not apply to individuals who retired prior to certain specified dates 
costs in excess of these caps will be paid by plan participants 
the medical care cost trend rate has a significant impact on the liabilities recorded by the company 
a one percent increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate would increase retiree medical obligations by million and increase retiree medical benefits expense by 
million 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act was enacted in december the act introduced a prescription drug benefit under medicare part d as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of this fsp provided accounting and disclosure guidance for employers who sponsor postretirement health care plans that provide drug benefits 
regulations regarding implementation of provisions relevant to the company s accounting are complex and contain acknowledged open issues 
the company recorded their potential effect during the third quarter of  retroactive to january  as prescribed by fsp the act reduced net periodic postretirement benefit cost by million in  including service cost  interest cost and amortization of the actuarial gain 
the total impact on the company s actuarial liability under all u 
s 
plans was a reduction of million and is being accounted for as an actuarial gain that will be amortized as a reduction of the company s periodic expense and balance sheet liability over periods from ten to twelve years 
during  the company enforced previously established retiree medical cost caps for its salaried  non bargained hourly and certain bargained retirees  implemented cost sharing for salaried  non bargained hourly and certain bargained hourly retirees not subject to medical cost caps  and implemented plan design changes in the retiree medical coverage provided to domestic salaried  non bargained and certain bargained hourly employees and retirees 
domestic salaried and non bargained hourly employees hired on or after january  and certain bargained hourly employees hired after january  are not eligible for these benefits 
in prior years the company implemented changes to the health benefits it provides to its domestic salaried and non bargained hourly employees 
subject to specific provisions contained in certain of its labor agreements  the company has reserved the right to modify or terminate such benefits at any time 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  the company had provided a guarantee of a portion of the bank loans made to its joint venture with nishikawa rubber company 
this debt guarantee was required of the partners by the joint venture agreement and served to support the credit worthiness of the joint venture  nishikawa standard company nisco 
on july   the joint venture entered into an additional bank loan with the joint venture partners each guaranteeing an equal portion of the amount borrowed 
in accordance with 
table of contents fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  guarantees meeting the characteristics described in the interpretation were required to be recorded at fair value 
as of december  the company had recorded a  liability related to the guarantee of this debt with a corresponding increase to the carrying value of its investment in the joint venture 
the company s maximum exposure under the two guarantee arrangements at december  was million 
on december   the company sold its automotive operations which included the nisco joint venture and has been released from its guarantee 
at december  the company had no off balance sheet arrangements 
certain operating leases related to property and equipment used in the operations of cooper standard automotive were guaranteed by the company 
these guarantees require the company  in the event cooper standard fails to honor its commitments  to satisfy the terms of the lease agreements 
as part of the sale of the automotive operations  the company is seeking releases of those guarantees but to date has been unable to secure releases from certain lessors 
the most significant lease is for a manufacturing facility with a remaining term of years and total remaining payments of approximately million 
other leases cover manufacturing equipment with remaining terms of from less than one year to four years and total remaining payments of approximately  the company does not believe it is presently probable that it will be called upon to make these payments 
accordingly  no accrual for these guarantees has been recorded 
if information becomes known to the company at a later date which indicates its performance under these guarantees is probable  accruals for the obligations will be required
