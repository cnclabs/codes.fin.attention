executive summary we had several key accomplishments in  the most significant being our improvement in new orders 
the strong market performance of our ep  epx  and digistar visual system technologies drove significant new orders and allowed us to increase our backlog during the year by 
with the increase in orders and backlog  we are now confident that was the low point in revenue  and that we will see revenue growth in we additionally made good progress in bringing our recently announced laser projector to market  and deliveries are expected to also contribute to revenue growth in both and beyond 
overall  we improved upon our net loss of  to finish with a net loss of  this was driven by the absence of impairments and our continued focus on reducing operating expenses 
our financial position also improved significantly in as we generated positive cash flow and completely repaid our short term debt of  with our strong new products  higher backlog  and good customer acceptance of our visual systems  we believe that we will achieve growth and profitability in major factors in historical performance the three major factors affecting performance of the company in  and were declines in the market following september   problems with several large military programs using an older technology called harmony  and a migration to off the shelf pcs driven by military customers 
following september  we received few orders from major north american airlines which were formerly large customers of our commercial simulation products 
this market has not yet fully recovered  but has been partially offset by gains in other commercial markets 
additionally  military events following that time have also affected us military markets  primarily because a number of large weapons programs have been either cancelled or delayed  causing reductions in the number of new military simulators needing visual systems 
with respect to the harmony product  during and we won six major military programs with total revenue of over million 
these big six programs had a negative impact on our prior years financial results because we experienced difficulties completing the programs 
the six programs fell behind schedule and required significantly more resources than expected 
as a result  our gross margins were depressed in and we also incurred liquidated damages and late penalties on these programs 
we had reserve balances of in   in and  in  to cover these potential costs 
in  we settled with one customer for approximately  in goods and services which were fully delivered in in addition  our actual incurred costs in and were  and  respectively 
at the end of  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts relating to the big six programs was  our collections in were  at the end of  cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts relating to the big six programs was  our collections in were  at the end of  there were no costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts relating to the big six programs 
related accounts receivable at the end of totaled  of which  was collected in february we received acceptance on the remaining two big six programs during and our work is now very near completion 
deliverables scheduled for performance in on these programs have been fully performed and invoiced 
a few minor deliverables scheduled in remain and their impact on our financial results is expected to be immaterial 
we have historically produced visual systems required by military customers with proprietary hardware 
in the past few years  a few major military customers have been driving producers of visual systems to provide systems offering similar capabilities that are based on off the shelf pc hardware in order to reduce their acquisition and replacement costs 
as a result  visual systems that were once sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars have been replaced by pc based visual systems which are sold at much lower prices 
we have been successful in this product transition  however  the volume of sales from off the shelf pc based visual systems has not been sufficient to replace the revenue lost from these products lower prices 
we expect this trend to continue 
results of operations our sales decreased by  primarily as a result of the spending constraints by customers in our military market which have existed since however  strong new orders during the year drove a significant  increase in our backlog 
this increase is expected to lead to growth in our sales and drive our return towards profitability 
our gross margins improved by over this increase was primarily driven by the  inventory impairment we took in continuing to focus on improving our cost structure  we reduced operating expenses by 
the major factor in this reduction was the execution of our restructuring plan 
we also reduced costs through both headcount attrition and reductions in development expenditures as our laser projector technology nears production 
lastly  we recognized gains of  on the sale of two assets in a building was sold for a gain of  and our cathode ray tube crt based projector assets were sold for a gain of  as we shifted our focus towards our new laser projector technology 
more detailed explanations of our results are provided below 
consolidated sales the following table summarizes our consolidated sales for fiscal year sales fiscal vs 
the primary reason for the decrease in sales was a continued reduction in sales to military customers  which decreased by  from in addition  service and support sales decreased by  as a result of the continued depression in sales to military customers 
these decreases were offset by a  increase in sales to planetarium customers as a result of the success of our digistar visual system technology 
sales to commercial customers remained relatively consistent with levels 
military markets continued to shrink as military funds have been diverted to other needs 
we believe this market will begin to improve in as military training requirements increase and we expect improvement in orders and sales from these customers 
a few large prime contractors that are both customers and competitors of ours have moved towards providing their own visual systems in an effort to protect their revenues and margins 
we also believe that there has been an increase in military contracts awarded directly to incumbents and a corresponding reduction in contracts being placed for open bid 
to compete against these trends  we strive to offer superior visual systems at competitive prices 
airlines have reduced purchases of new aircraft  resulting in a decrease in the number of new simulators required for training 
however  since many airlines are upgrading their current simulators  we have offset market trends as a result of the compatibility of our ep ct product with our large installed visual system base 
our orders improved over levels and we expect this higher order volume to continue through while our overall sales decreased in  new orders received significantly increased during the year 
as a result  backlog increased by from  to  we believe this increase in backlog will result in higher revenues in and beyond 
fiscal vs 
sales in declined from  in this was primarily the result of a  reduction in sales from military customers due to military spending constraints from through we also had a  decrease in sales to commercial customers as a result of reductions in overall aircraft purchases and a  decrease in our service and support sales also resulting from military spending constraints 
these decreases were offset by a  increase in sales to planetarium customers as a result of the successful introduction of our new digistar technology into our visual systems 
while sales decreased in  backlog increased over from  to gross margin the following table summarizes our gross margin and the percentage to total sales during for fiscal year gross margin gross margin percentage fiscal vs 
our gross margin percentage improved to in  compared with in our gross margins were depressed as a result of a  inventory impairment loss 
in  gross margins from sales to our military customers decreased due to a change in product mix 
significant deliveries were made in on large military contracts with a high proportion of subcontract pass through sales resulting in lower gross margins 
gross margins from sales to our planetarium customers decreased and our service and support gross margins decreased in both decreases were a result of unique  high margin deliveries during we achieved a gross margin increase in sales to commercial customers as a result of improved cost performance 
also offsetting these decreases was a gross margin increase due to reductions in warranty expense as we improved product reliability 
fiscal vs 
our gross margin percentage decreased to in  compared with in this was primarily the result of a  of inventory impairment 
offsetting this impairment decrease was improvement in gross margins related to military customers as a result of progress made on the big six programs 
gross margin percentages on sales to commercial airline customers decreased by in as a result of increased pricing pressure in the commercial simulation market and program cost overruns 
in addition  we experienced a gross margin decrease as a result of increases in warranty and support costs due to two vendor part failures 
these decreases were slightly offset by a increase in our service support gross margin percentages as a result of several high margin spares shipments in operating expenses the following table summarizes our operating expenses during fiscal year selling  general and administrative sg a research and development r d restructuring charges recoveries impairment loss operating expenses sg a expenses fiscal vs 
sg a expenses decreased during as anticipated  we achieved  in sg a expense reductions from reduced headcount  in reduced equipment costs and the remainder from various cost reductions 
we expect further reductions in sg a expenses in as we continue to streamline our selling efforts and reduce overall expenses see recent development 
fiscal vs 
in  sg a expenses remained relatively consistent with in  we achieved  in labor savings which were offset by a increase in net rent expenses due to a loss of rental income  and a  increase in bad debt expense resulting from the absence of favorable expense reversals recorded in r d expenses fiscal vs 
r d expenses decreased during we achieved reductions during of  in labor and associated overheads  in development expenses as our laser projector nears completion  and in software and miscellaneous expenses 
we expect further reductions in r d expenses in as we move our laser projector into production see recent development 
fiscal vs 
r d expenses decreased during as a result of  reduction in labor costs and  reduction in development expenditures for materials and software 
restructuring charges recoveries fiscal vs 
we did not record any restructuring charges in due to declines in our two primary markets and the resulting decrease in our through sales  we implemented restructuring plans in and to reduce our labor costs and drive down both cost of sales and operating expenses  therefore reducing our net losses 
these plans were also implemented to reduce our labor cash outflows and improve our cash flow from operations 
during  we recorded restructuring charges of  related to reductions in force of approximately full time equivalent employees 
our labor reductions were executed throughout the company  with headcount reductions occurring in direct program management and program engineering  r d engineering  marketing efforts and g a support 
this restructuring resulted in a reduction of approximately  per year in our labor costs  which was partially achieved in and entirely in  through reductions in cost of sales and operating expenses 
fiscal vs 
during  we recorded restructuring charges of  related to a reduction in force of approximately employees 
this labor reduction was also executed throughout the company  with headcount reductions occurring in direct program management and program engineering  r d engineering  marketing efforts and g a support 
this restructuring resulted in a reduction of approximately  per year in our labor costs  which was partially achieved in  and entirely in  through reductions in cost of sales and operating expenses 
impairment loss fiscal vs 
during  we did not incur any impairment charges 
in  we recognized an impairment loss of  on certain fixed assets specifically used to build  test and demonstrate our harmony product 
fiscal vs 
during  we recognized an impairment loss of on software licenses that were no longer used 
gains the following table summarizes our gains during fiscal year gain on sale of assets gain on assets held for sale gain on curtailment of pension plan in  we recognized gains on the sale of two assets totaling  a building held for sale was sold resulting in a gain of  we sold our crt based projector assets to vdc recognizing a gain of  as we shifted our focus to our new laser projector 
in  we also sold a building and recognized a gain of  we had no other sale of assets in during  we recognized a gain on the amendment of our pension plan of  in order to match current market practices  the pension plan was amended to curtail accrual of future benefits 
at the same time  the e s k plan was amended to permit the board of directors to grant additional discretionary matching contributions based on profitability as well as other financial and operational considerations 
additionally  we recognized a gain on assets held for sale of  on the sale of a building during other income and expense the following table summarizes our other income and expense during fiscal year other income expense  net we reduced our other expenses in by due to the absence of a loss recorded in for the write off of an investment  a reduction in interest expense due to reduced debt levels  and an increase in currency gains 
the reduction of was primarily a reduction in interest expense due to reduced debt levels 
income taxes the following table summarizes our income taxes during fiscal year income tax expense benefit the income tax expense in was primarily attributable to foreign income taxes 
the income tax benefit in was primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain worldwide income tax contingencies 
the income tax benefit was the result of a change in the us tax law  which allows us to use additional net operating losses to offset taxable income 
deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss carryforwards are fully reserved through a valuation allowance 
recent development since  both our military and commercial markets have consistently decreased in size primarily as a result of diversion of military funds to other needs and reductions in commercial airline purchases of new aircraft 
while we expect orders in these markets to increase in and  we do not expect these market increases to be themselves sufficient to return the company to profitability in in order to improve our profitability and cash flow based on our projections for  we initiated a restructuring plan in march to reduce costs from cost of sales and operating expenses and to improve our cash flow from operations 
the largest cost driver of our business is our labor and labor related costs 
as a result  we reduced our aggregate labor force by approximately full time equivalent employees at an expected cost of  in severance benefits to be paid out over the next two years 
we expect this action to reduce our labor and labor related costs by approximately  per year 
this plan has been fully executed as of the filing of this annual report on form k 
due to the timing of the restructuring  we expect to reduce our costs approximately  in our labor reductions were executed primarily in program management  program engineering and r d engineering 
liquidity and capital resources summary information concerning our financial position as of fiscal year end cash and cash equivalents restricted cash line of credit agreements net short term cash indebtedness long term debt net cash indebtedness stockholders equity in  we continued to improve our overall liquidity  paid off our lines of credit  reduced our reliance on short term debt  and allowed our credit facilities to expire 
we accomplished this by improving our cash flows from operations  selling an office building  and selling our crt based projector assets 
our improved liquidity has assisted our ability to continue to issue letters of credit as required 
in addition we believe our products are performing well and we expect to meet our delivery requirements 
as a result  we do not foresee any liquidated damages or late delivery penalties in outlook for  we project operations will fund themselves as well as our investing activities because we expect our sales to increase as a result of our strong orders in and significant increase in backlog at year end and because of the restructuring we initiated in march see recent development for further information concerning this restructure 
circumstances that could materially affect liquidity in include  but are not limited to i our ability to successfully deliver new technologies and products  ii our ability to meet forecasted sales levels  and iii our ability to continue to reduce costs and expenses 
for years beyond  we believe cash from operations will be sufficient for our planned needs 
we further believe our long term investment in research and development and our current product strategy will allow our business to grow 
we also expect to augment our cash position with the sale of an additional office building during or in addition  we may supplement our cash resources with additional credit facilities  if available with terms that are satisfactory to us 
cash flow year ended december net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents increased to  during fiscal year  primarily as a result of cash provided by investing activities 
during  we sold a building which was held for sale and our crt based projector assets 
operating activities operating activities used of cash during this primarily resulted from a net loss of  adjusted for non cash items of  offset by changes in working capital 
changes in working capital provided  of cash during our accounts receivable decrease provided  mainly due to collections on several large contracts 
our inventory decrease provided  due to the sale of  of crt based projector inventory in the sale to video display corporation  and due to improved inventory management 
our net costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts decrease provided  primarily due to the completion of the remaining two big six programs 
our accounts payable decrease used  as a result of our continued focus on reducing our outstanding trade payables and our improved liquidity 
our accrued expense decrease used  during  we met the requirements of a settlement agreement we entered into at the end of with one of our customers concerning the delivery of harmony based visual systems 
we had accrued  and our settlement costs were approximately  in addition we charged  against our warranty reserve  and our payments for severance benefits during related to prior years restructure plans was approximately  operating activities used of cash during this primarily resulted from a net loss of  adjusted for non cash items of  offset by changes in working capital 
changes in working capital provided  of cash during our net costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts decrease provided  due to the completion and billing of all but two of the big six programs 
our accounts payables decrease used  as a result of improved liquidity in as well as due to a shrinkage of our business 
our accrued expense decrease used  of cash 
this was the result of warranty claims of  and the result of compensation and benefits accruals decreasing  compensation and benefits accruals decreased partially  due to reduced headcounts in and as a result of restructurings implemented during that time 
also  our accrued liquidated damages and late penalties increased due to reaching a  settlement with one of our big six program customers 
in addition  we had a net decrease of in restructure charges  with approximately  in severance benefits paid 
operating activities provided  of cash during this primarily resulted from a net loss of  adjusted for non cash items of  offset by changes in working capital 
changes in working capital provided  of cash during our accounts receivable decrease provided  due primarily to collections on the big six programs and improved collections overall 
our decrease in inventories provided  due to a decrease in raw material requirements and a reduction in program related work in process 
the decrease in raw material requirements and program related work in process were related to lower sales volume and improved inventory management during in addition  the decrease in work in process was also affected by progress made on the big six programs as these costs were converted to cost of sales 
our net costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts provided  due to a decrease in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts of  and a decrease in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts of  the decrease in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings was primarily a result of the successful near completion of the big six programs 
the decrease in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts decreased  primarily due to deliveries made to customers in related to orders received in our accrued expense decrease used  of cash 
this was the result of warranty claims of  and the result of compensation and benefits accruals at year end decreasing  partially due to reduced headcounts in and as a result of restructures during that time 
this was offset by a net increase of  in restructure charges  with approximately  in severance benefits paid 
our accounts payables decreased  due an improvement in liquidity during investing activities investing activities provided  of cash during this primarily resulted from the sale of assets 
we sold one of our office buildings that was no longer in use for  in cash 
we sold our crt based projector assets  the escp and targetview  for  in cash as a result of deciding to focus our efforts on the development of our new laser based projector 
we sold an investment for in cash 
this was offset by the use of  of cash for the purchase of property  plant and equipment and the use of of cash for a deposit 
the deposit was required in relation to the sale of our office building and the rental guarantee we entered into with the buyer 
investing activities provided of cash during this primarily resulted from the sale of one of our office buildings that was no longer in use for  in cash 
this was offset by the use of  of cash for the purchase of investments in property  plant and equipment 
investing activities used of cash during this was primarily the result of our investment in property  plant  and equipment of  this was offset by the cash provided by the sale of one of our office buildings that was no longer in use for  financing activities financing activities used  of cash during this was primarily due to the paying off of our lines of credit during and due to an increase in restricted cash requirements in we are required under our credit agreements with our banks to collateralize any letter of credit we issue with cash equal to of the value of the outstanding value of the letter of credit 
financing activities provided  of cash during this was primarily a result of a restricted cash requirement under our line of credit agreements 
financing activities used  of cash during primarily as a result of paying down our line of credit borrowings 
credit ratings our credit ratings were lowered by moody s investor services moody s during our convertible subordinate debentures due credit rating was downgraded from b to caa our long term senior implied rating was downgraded from ba to b these credit rating downgrades may affect our future ability to renew our credit facilities  negotiate new credit facilities  and issue debt and equity securities 
with respect to moody s  issuers with a ba rating are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk 
issuers with a b rating are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to high credit risk 
issuers with caa ratings are subject to very high credit risk 
the  modifiers show relative standing within the major categories  being the highest  or best  modifier in terms of credit quality 
moody s long term senior implied ratings are generally employed for speculative grade corporate issuers 
the long term senior implied rating is moody s opinion of a corporate family s ability to honor its financial obligations and is assigned to a corporate family as if it had a single class of debt and a single consolidated legal entity structure 
credit facilities our credit facilities expired in december and we are currently in negotiations to obtain new line of credit facilities 
however  there can be no assurances that we will be successful in negotiating lines of credit on terms that will be acceptable to us 
while we currently do not believe we will require access to a line of credit facility in the next months  our needs may change in the future 
during  we had two secured line of credit facilities  one of which provided for borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit up to  and the other provided for borrowings up to  we were in compliance with all financial covenants and ratios required by these facilities in the ability to issue letters of credit and bank guarantees has become more important to our business as sales in countries other than in north america and western europe have increased 
letters of credit and bank guarantees in many countries are required as part of any final contract 
letters of credit and bank guarantees are issued to ensure our performance to third parties 
we currently have one finance arrangement which facilitates the issuance of letters of credit and bank guarantees 
under the terms of the arrangement  we are required to maintain a balance in a specific cash account equal to or greater than the outstanding value of all letters of credit issued  plus other amounts necessary to adequately secure our obligations with the financial institution 
the arrangement provides a first priority security interest in the specific cash account 
certain of the terms of the arrangement prohibit us from creating  incurring  assuming or permitting to exist any indebtedness or liabilities resulting from borrowings  loans or advances  merging into  consolidating with any other entity  or making any substantial change in the nature of our business  or making new loans or advances to or investments in any other entity without prior written consent from the financial institution 
as of december   our outstanding letters of credit totaled  letters of credit that expire in total  and those that expire in total convertible subordinated debentures due as of december   we had approximately  of convertible subordinated debentures the debentures outstanding that are due in the debentures are unsecured and are convertible at each bondholder s option into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share for an aggregate of  shares of our common stock if all outstanding debentures are converted  subject to adjustment 
the debentures are redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  at par 
rental guarantee during  we entered into a three year building rental guarantee with the buyer of a building that was available for sale 
under terms of the rental guarantee  our maximum obligation will be reduced as the buyer leases out space in this building 
as of december   we had accrued  for this obligation and of the leasable space in this building was available 
other in  we expect capital expenditures to be similar to  or approximately  to  there were no material capital expenditure commitments at the end of  nor do we anticipate any over the next several years 
our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of  shares of our common stock 
as of february    shares remained available for repurchase under the plans approved by the board of directors 
no shares were repurchased during   or stock may be acquired on the open market or through negotiated transactions depending on market conditions  share price and other factors 
we also maintain trade credit arrangements with certain of our suppliers 
the unavailability of a significant portion of  or the loss of  these trade credit arrangements from suppliers would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
in the event we were unable to make timely deliveries of products pursuant to the terms of various agreements with third parties or certain of our contracts were adversely impacted for failure to meet delivery requirements  we may be unable to meet our anticipated working capital needs  routine capital expenditures  and current debt service obligations on a short term and long term basis 
we believe our existing cash  restricted cash  letter of credit availability under our current arrangement  and expected cash from future operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital needs  routine capital expenditures and current debt service obligations 
at december   our total indebtedness was  consisting of long term debt 
both of our credit facilities expired in december  and we are currently in renegotiations to extend one of these credit facilities 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in renegotiating this credit facility 
our cash and restricted cash  subject to various restrictions set forth in this annual report on form k  are available for working capital needs  capital expenditures  strategic investments  mergers and acquisitions  stock repurchases and other potential cash needs as they may arise effects of inflation the effects of inflation were not considered material during fiscal years   and  and are not expected to be material for fiscal year off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we normally do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spe s  which can be established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in  we formed a joint venture with quadrant group plc quadrant known as quest flight training limited 
quest 
quest provides certain equipment  software  training  and other goods and services to the united kingdom ministry of defence uk mod and other related governmental entities with regard to an upgrade of the uk mod e d facility and e d sentry aircrew training services 
we have a interest in quest which is accounted for as an investment under the equity method and therefore is not consolidated in our financial statements 
the financial position and operating results of quest are immaterial to our financial results 
in connection with the services of quest to the uk mod  during fiscal year we entered into guarantees of various obligations of quest 
as of december   we had four guarantees outstanding related to quest 
pursuant to the first guarantee  we have guaranteed  jointly and severally with quadrant  the performance of quest in relation to its contract with the uk mod 
if quest fails to meet its obligations under the contract then we and quadrant are required to perform under the terms of the contract 
due to the length of the contract and the uncertainty of performance for which we would be liable if quest fails to perform  we cannot estimate the maximum amount of possible future payments 
this guarantee is in place until pursuant to the second guarantee  we have guaranteed  jointly and severally with quadrant  up to a maximum amount of  approximately  the performance of quest where not subcontracted  and the performance of quest where subcontracted but where the subcontractor is not liable to meet its obligation due to any limitation of liability in the sub contract agreement 
this guarantee is in place until pursuant to the third guarantee  we have pledged our equity shares in quest to guarantee payment by quest of a loan agreement executed by quest 
the loan agreement terminates in the pledge of our equity shares in quest will expire at such time as quest s obligations under the loan agreement are satisfied or the date on which the loan agreement is otherwise terminated 
in the event of default on this loan agreement  the lending institution can request that the trustee holding such equity shares surrender them to the lending institution in order to satisfy all amounts then outstanding under the loan agreement 
as of december   the outstanding loan balance was  approximately 
quadrant has made identical guarantees for this obligation of quest 
pursuant to the fourth guarantee  we have guaranteed payment  up to a maximum of approximately  in the event that quest has a default event  as defined by its loan agreement 
this guarantee is in place until quadrant has made identical guarantees for this obligation of quest 
as of december   no amounts have been accrued for any estimated losses under these guarantees because we believe that quest will meet all of its performance and financial obligations in relation to its contract with the uk mod 
however  if we are required to perform under any or all of the four guarantees  it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and liquidity 
contractual obligations the impact that our contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt  including current portion operating lease obligations purchase obligations pension and post retirement plan obligations total amounts represent the expected cash payments on our long term debt  including interest payments  and do not include any fair value adjustments or bond premiums or discounts 
the majority of the operating lease obligations are land leases for periods up to years on the land underlying our buildings 
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on e s and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
our maximum rental guarantee payments are included in purchase obligations 
our policy is to make contributions to pension and post retirement plans only if required to by statutory funding requirements 
not included in the table above are our guarantees related to quest

restatement of quarterly financial statements in this annual report on form k and our prior year annual report on form k  the financial data for the first three quarters of reflects the restatement of amounts for the correction of certain accounting errors previously reported for the first three fiscal quarters of all information presented in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in both the current and prior year annual reports reflects the restatement 
restatement of financial information the aggregate effect of the restatement increased previously reported net loss for the quarters ended march   june  and september  by   and  respectively 
the aggregate effect of the restatement increased previously reported basic and diluted loss per share for the quarters ended march   june  and september   by  and  respectively 
discussion of accounting principles during our year end close process and review of the financial statements of our wholly owned subsidiary  evans sutherland computer limited e s ltd  we identified errors in e s ltd 
s quarterly financial statements due to the misapplication of the percentage of completion methodology as prescribed in american institute of public accountant s statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  sop  percentage of completion method alternative b as described in paragraphs and for recognition of revenue on our long term projects 
the following definitions  discussions  and calculations show the accounting treatments involved 
i earned revenue is the amount of gross profit earned on a contract for a period plus the costs incurred on the contract during the period 
ii cost of earned revenue is our actual cost incurred during the period  including materials  labor  subcontractors  and other costs 
iii gross profit earned on a contract is computed by multiplying the total estimated gross profit on the contract by the percentage of completion utilizing the cost to cost method 
the excess of that amount over the amount of gross profit reported in prior periods is the earned gross profit recognized in the income statement for the current period 
specifically  our percentage of completion  gross profit earned  and earned revenue are calculated with the following formulas a total cost of earned revenue to date c percentage of completion to date b total estimated cost at completion d total estimated earned revenue at completion b total estimated costs at completion e total estimated gross profit at completion c percentage of completion to date e total estimated gross profit at completion f gross profit earned to date a total cost of earned revenue to date f gross profit earned to date g earned revenue to date discussion of accounting errors the accounting errors identified in by management requiring adjustment in previously issued financial statements as a result of the misapplication of the percentage of completion methodology as prescribed in sop percentage of completion method alternative b are described below 
i early recognition of costs 
during the first three quarters of  costs were erroneously recorded to certain long term projects before the underlying costs were actually incurred causing our cost of earned revenue to date to be overstated 
these errors caused our a total costs of earned revenue to date numerator to be overstated  therefore overstating our c percentage of completion to date 
this overstatement of the c percentage of completion to date then drove overstatements in both our f gross profit earned to date and g earned revenue to date for these projects 
these overstatements of sales  costs of sales  and gross profit occurred during and were included in the company s previously issued q filings for the first three quarters of ii understatement of total estimated costs at completion 
during the first three quarters of  b total estimated costs at completion were underestimated therefore overstating our c percentage of completion to date 
this overstated c percentage of completion to date then drove overstatements in both our f gross profit earned to date and g earned revenue to date for these projects 
in these circumstances  our a total cost of earned revenue to date on these projects was accurately measured 
these overstatements in sales and gross profit were included in the company s previously issued form q filings for the first three quarters of iii recognition of revenue and gross profit earned in excess of total contract amounts 
during the first three quarters of  costs were recorded to certain long term projects and not included in each of these project s b total estimated costs at completion 
as a result  a total costs of revenue earned to date numerator exceeded the b total estimated cost at completion denominator  deriving the c percentage of completion to date in excess of 
the application of this incorrect c percentage of completion to date resulted in the recognition of f gross profit earned to date in excess of the e estimated gross profit at completion and the recognition of g earned revenue to date in excess of total estimated contract value at completion 
in these circumstances  our a total cost of earned revenue to date on these projects was accurately measured 
these overstatements of sales and gross margin were included in the company s previously issued form q filings for the first three quarters of background on the restatement our us finance group discovered these errors as part of the year end close process and application of our normal year end internal control processes 
in consultation with our audit committee  we then performed an in depth review and analysis of e s ltd 
s percentage of completion calculations  its financial results and processes to determine how these errors occurred and which periods they affected 
to ensure that financial results were not distorted by similar errors  we performed a thorough review of all of our long term contracts with e s ltd 
for which revenue was recognized 
we confirmed contract values  verified costs incurred  reviewed estimates of total costs  and recalculated percentage of completion ratios for each contract 
further  we confirmed that the operating results of e s ltd 
during were subject to the normal close process and related controls of the us finance group both on an interim and year end basis the same procedures applied during the year end close which identified the errors 
based on these procedures  we concluded that during the interim and annual periods  all of our long term contracts complied with the percentage of completion method of accounting prescribed by sop and sales  cost of sales  and gross profits were correctly stated 
as a result of the procedures performed for both and  we identified two key factors underlying the errors in at e s ltd 
i the incorrect application of the percentage of completion method of accounting as outlined in sop  and ii the inconsistent operation of internal controls to provide timely identification and correction of this error 
we believe both factors were caused by changes in key accounting personnel and financial reporting relationships at e s ltd 
during the first three quarters of i at the beginning of  financial reporting responsibilities were revised such that the e s ltd 
finance director no longer reported directly to the us finance group and ultimately to our chief financial officer  but rather reported primarily to the e s ltd 
general manager 
this revision in reporting responsibilities  in part  resulted in the financial reporting process on long term contracts not being subject to the timely performance of the us finance group s internal control processes on an interim basis 
ii in july  a new cfo was appointed in the united states 
as he started in his new position  the cfo concentrated initially on the united states operations  policies and procedures and deferred a similar analysis of e s ltd 
s operations to a later date 
these personnel related items have been addressed as the e s ltd 
finance director again reports directly to the cfo in the united states 
additionally  we performed an evaluation of the e s ltd 
internal controls and procedures related to the restatement 
actions taken in response to our evaluation are more thoroughly described in item a of part iii of this annual report on form k 
application of critical accounting estimates the applications of accounting estimates discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements 
their application places significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting estimates are described in the following paragraphs 
a summary of significant accounting policies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future results rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition revenue from long term contracts requiring significant production  modification and customization is recorded using the percentage of completion method 
this method uses the ratio of costs incurred to management s estimate of total anticipated costs 
our estimates of total costs include assumptions  such as man hours to complete  estimated materials cost  and estimates of other direct and indirect costs 
actual results may vary significantly from our estimates 
if the actual costs are higher than management s anticipated total costs  then an adjustment is required to reduce the previously recognized revenue as the ratio of costs incurred to management s estimate was overstated 
if actual costs are lower than management s anticipated total costs  then an adjustment is required to increase the previously recognized revenue as the ratio of costs incurred to management s estimate is understated 
adjustments for revisions of previous estimates are made in the period they become known 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts billings on uncompleted long term contracts may be greater than or less than incurred costs and estimated earnings 
as a result  these differences are recorded as an asset or liability on the balance sheet 
since revenue recognized on these long term contracts includes management s estimates of total anticipated costs  the amounts in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts also include these estimates 
inventories inventory includes materials at standard costs  which approximates average costs  as well as inventoried costs on programs including material  labor  subcontracting costs  as well as an allocation of indirect costs 
we periodically review inventories for excess supply  obsolescence  and valuations above estimated realizable amounts  and then provide a reserve we consider sufficient to cover these items 
reserve adequacy is based on estimates of future sales  product pricing  and requirements to complete projects 
revisions of these estimates would result in adjustments to our operating results 
contract damages and penalties accrued liabilities include amounts for liquidated damages and late delivery penalties 
while current contracts could include additional liquidated damages and late delivery penalties  we have included all amounts we believe we are liable for as of december  these liquidated damages are based primarily on estimates of project completion dates 
to the extent completion dates are not consistent with our estimates  these damage and penalty accruals may require additional adjustments 
allowance for doubtful accounts we specifically analyze accounts receivables and consider historical experience  customer creditworthiness  facts and circumstances specific to outstanding balances  current economic trends  and payment term changes when evaluating adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
changes in these factors could result in material adjustments to the expense recognized for bad debts 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our actual income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items  such as accrued liabilities  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period  we must include a corresponding adjustment within the income tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant judgment by management is required to determine our provision for income taxes  our deferred income tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred income tax assets 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the book value of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
when this occurs  we review the value assigned to long lived assets by analyzing the anticipated  undiscounted cash flows they generate 
when the expected future undiscounted cash flows from these assets do not exceed their carrying balances  we determine the estimated fair value of such assets 
the amount of impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their estimated fair value 
assets held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
restructuring charges restructuring charges that occurred prior to january  were recorded under eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
as a result  restructuring charges  other than amounts for severance and benefits  can be recorded when a detailed restructuring plan to exit specific activities has been approved by management prior to the financial reporting date and the company has the ability to reasonably estimate costs 
estimated amounts for severance and benefits are accrued once the potentially affected employees have been notified of the termination and severance benefits have been communicated 
the communication must include  at a minimum  the number of impacted employees  the job functions and the locations that are affected 
if actual costs differ from the estimated costs  adjustments to the restructuring charges are required 
restructuring charges that occurred after december  were recorded under sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
as a result  a liability for the estimated costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized when the liability is incurred 
thus estimated amounts for severance and benefits are accrued once the affected employees have been notified of the termination  for contract terminations costs are accrued once the contract is terminated or the company ceases receiving any benefit from the contract  and for leased property costs are accrued once the company has exited the facility and is no longer receiving any benefit from the lease 
if actual costs differ from the estimated costs  adjustments to the restructuring charges are required 
depreciation and amortization of fixed assets and intangibles purchases of property and equipment are recorded at cost and major improvements are capitalized 
depreciation is included in cost of goods sold  research and development or selling  general and administrative expenses depending on the nature of the asset 
depreciation is expensed based on the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives of the property manufacturing machinery and equipment years office furniture and equipment years buildings and improvements years recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial accounting standard no 
 inventory costs an amendment to arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas amends arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb  chapter  previously stated that 


under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges 



sfas requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  and earlier application is permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  fasb issued financial accounting standard no 
sfas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
the guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in that opinion  however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
sfas amends apb opinion to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  and earlier application is permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  fasb issued financial accounting standard no 
r sfas r  share based payment 
sfas r is a revision of sfas sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
primarily  sfas r focuses on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
sfas r requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
therefore  if an employee does not ultimately render the requisite service  the costs recognized related to unvested options will be reversed 
sfas r is effective for us as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  under these guidelines we will adopt sfas r as of the beginning of the third quarter of we do not expect the adoption of sfas r to have a material impact on our financial position or cash flows  however it will have a material impact on our results of operations as we are required to recognize stock based compensation to our employees as compensation expense over their service period

future events and actual results could differ materially from those set forth in  contemplated by  or underlying the forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from these forward looking statements 
in addition to the other risks described in factors that may affect our future results discussed below  important factors to consider in evaluating such forward looking statements include risks of product demand  market acceptance  economic conditions  competitive products and pricing  difficulties in product development  and product delays 
in light of these risks and uncertainties  there can be no assurance that the events contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this annual report will  in fact  occur 
factors that may affect our future results our domestic and international businesses operate in highly competitive markets that involve a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
while we are optimistic about our long term prospects  the following discussion highlights some risks and uncertainties that should be considered in evaluating our growth outlook 
our business model is changing and may not produce consistent earnings our success depends on our ability to compete in an industry that is highly competitive  with rapid technological advances and products that require constant improvement in both price and performance 
in most of our markets we are experiencing increased competition  and we expect this trend to continue 
when new systems are ordered  prices are usually below our comparable  last generation systems 
success in this environment requires a business model that emphasizes smaller systems and associated hardware revenue  with greater dependence on software  databases  and support services 
we have made significant progress in adapting to this new business model and introducing products emphasizing the new factors for success 
however  there is no assurance that this model will succeed and ensure profitability in the future 
competitors may infringe e s intellectual property throughout its history e s has been awarded patents  with still active 
another applications are pending 
while we have not had any significant intellectual property infringement by competitors  we are entering production stage of a new product  the e s laser projector 
we have a number of patents either issued or pending on this technology  but it represents a new field for us and may attract competitors with a risk of infringement and costly legal processes to defend our intellectual property rights 
migration to pc s in the commercial simulation market may negatively impact our revenues currently  off the shelf pc technology is not used in visual systems for level d certification in the commercial simulation market 
however  advances in technology could make it possible to attain level d certification with such systems 
if this occurs  e s would expect to deliver a range of products at different prices  with the risk of lower average prices and lower total revenue for the mix of commercial systems 
prime contractors may continue bring workshare into their own company and decrease the demand for e s products large prime contractors in the defense and aerospace industry have encountered the same competitive pressures described earlier for simulation and training revenue 
to protect their own revenue and margins  most have responded by putting pressure on smaller suppliers  as well as bringing work in house to protect established engineering organizations wherever possible 
this trend has  in effect  created new competitors for our traditional business 
these in house engineering groups attempt to do only the most profitable work  such as software and databases  and leave less profitable hardware development to others 
often the costs of these efforts are not visible to the end customer because they are part of a much larger contract 
if these trends continue and the end customers accept the results  they could reduce demand for the most profitable future portions of our revenue stream and business model  software and databases 
delays in new product introductions could negatively affect financial performance during  we intend to introduce several important new products  including the simfusion and the e s laser projector 
delays in introducing and delivering these products could reduce their planned revenue and profit contribution 
changes in government priorities may further impact the military simulation market during the last several years significant changes have taken place in budget priorities for both us and international government spending  especially military spending 
some of these changes have resulted in delays or reductions of visual system purchases 
while we have downsized our company in accordance with these changes  we have no assurance that such delays will not continue to occur or accelerate and cause further declines in our revenue from this market 
we depend on several significant customers and our net sales could suffer if their purchases decline we currently derive a significant portion of our sales from a limited number of non us government customers 
the loss of any one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we were dependent on four of our non us government customers for approximately of our consolidated sales in we expect that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our sales in the foreseeable future 
we have no assurance that sales from this limited number of customers will continue to reach or exceed historical levels in the future 
we do not have supply contracts with any of our significant customers 
our operations could be hurt by terrorist attacks and other activities that make air travel difficult or reduce the willingness of our commercial airline customers to purchase our simulation products during  million  or of our total revenue generated  was derived from sales of our visual systems to commercial airline companies and other third parties in the commercial airline industry 
the demand for our various commercial simulation products and services is heavily dependent upon new orders from these commercial airline customers 
in the event terrorist attacks or other activities make air travel difficult or reduce the demand or willingness of our customers to purchase our commercial simulation products  our revenue may decline substantially 
our shareholders may not realize certain opportunities because of the anti takeover effect of state law we may be subject to the utah control shares acquisition act which provides that any person who acquires or more of the outstanding voting shares of a publicly held utah corporation will not have voting rights with respect to the acquired shares unless a majority of the disinterested shareholders of the corporation votes to grant such rights 
this could deprive shareholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares or other advantages that large accumulations of stock would provide because anyone interested in acquiring e s could only do so with the cooperation of our board of directors and a majority of disinterested shareholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks to which we are exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
our international sales  which in fiscal years  and accounted for  and of our totals sales  respectively  are concentrated in the united kingdom  continental europe  and asia 
in general  we enter into sale agreements with our international customers denominated in us dollars 
foreign currency purchase and sale contracts may be entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures 
we do not enter into foreign currency contracts for trading purposes and do not use leveraged contracts 
as of december   we had sales contracts in euros with approximately  remaining to collect  sales contracts in gbp with approximately  remaining to invoice and collect  and we had entered into one foreign currency derivative contract 
we recognized a loss of related to the foreign currency derivative as of december  as no settlement provision is permitted under the contract  we recorded an amount due from a financial services company as prepaid expenses and deposits and a liability for the amount owed by us to the financial service company as accrued expense in the amounts of and  respectively  as of december  the contract expires in january we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by maintaining a high proportion of our debt in fixed rate instruments 
as of december   our fixed rate instruments consist solely of our convertible debentures due in the outstanding balance of the convertible debentures as of december  was  the fair value of the convertible debentures  based on quoted market prices was  as of december
