cadmus is the world s largest provider of content processing and production services to scientific  technical and medical stm journal publishers  the fifth largest periodicals printer in north america  and a leading provider of specialty packaging and promotional printing services 
organizational structure the company is focused on two segments 
the publisher services segment provides products and services to both not for profit and commercial publishers in three primary product lines stm journals  special interest and trade magazines  and books and directories

the specialty packaging segment provides high quality specialty packaging and promotional printing  assembly  fulfillment and distribution services to consumer product and other customers 
executive summary the company focuses primarily on niche markets where it sees underlying demand strength  a willingness on the part of customers to outsource non core activities  and relatively few large and well positioned competitors 
more specifically  the company has focused on providing outsourced publisher services both content processing and printing for the scholarly publishing  educational and other markets 
the company has a leading position in the stm market and delivers customized content processing services using state of the art technologies  in addition to traditional print services 
the company has continued to invest in opportunities in the educational market and in certain proprietary technology products known as emerging solutions  which include articleworks  knowledgeworks  mediaworks  path  and dpub 
the company s specialty packaging segment has achieved strong growth and greatly improved financial performance in recent years as a result of focusing on growth markets that benefit from the customized package design services the company offers  particularly in the healthcare  consumer products and telecommunications markets 
the company s us packaging facility is both iso registered and has passed customer cgmp compliance audits as evidence of the high level of quality delivered to our customers 
the specialty packaging segment has also differentiated itself by developing a proprietary network of offshore production affiliates  known as global packaging solutions  and by linking those operations and its customers via a proprietary inventory management and fulfillment system 
the focus on more stable niche markets and on providing more and profitable services to those markets  when combined with the strong growth and improved profitability of the specialty packaging segment  has permitted the company to achieve more stable operating results and reduce leverage in a challenging economic and industry environment 
in june  the company initiated a comprehensive equipment upgrade plan to its publisher services print platform and specialty packaging capabilities 
the plan is designed to continue to grow the company s position in its target publishing markets  to sustain the impressive growth generated in its specialty packaging segment  to retire older and less efficient press equipment  and to more aggressively rationalize capacity across its manufacturing platform 
in connection with this equipment upgrade plan  the company will be expanding and renovating several of its facilities to accommodate new equipment  to permit improved work flows  and to facilitate the rationalization of similar work currently performed at multiple sites 
the company has ordered substantially all of the equipment in connection with this plan and will soon be commencing building renovations and site preparation 
it is expected that the equipment upgrades and the expansion of facilities will be substantially complete in fiscal 
table of contents application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company considers the following accounting policies to be critical policies which involve various estimation processes allowance for doubtful accounts valuation of intangible assets and goodwill pension and other post retirement benefits income taxes self insurance reserves allowance for doubtful accounts 
cadmus policy with respect to its trade receivable is to maintain an adequate allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the inability of customers to make required payments 
the company s process to estimate the collectibility of its trade accounts receivable balances consists of two steps 
first  the company evaluates specific accounts for which it has information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations eg  bankruptcy 
in these cases  the company uses its judgment  based on available facts and circumstances  and records a specific allowance for that customer against the receivable to reflect the amount it expects to ultimately collect 
second  the company establishes an additional reserve for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to aging categories  based on management s best estimate 
the company periodically evaluates the adequacy of its reserves based on the available facts and circumstances at the time 
if the financial condition of cadmus customers were to deteriorate and result in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill 
effective july   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires companies to discontinue amortizing goodwill and to perform annual impairment tests 
in completing the transitional impairment test required by sfas no 
 the company tested the net goodwill balances attributable to each of its reporting units for indications of impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
fair value was determined using discounted cash flow estimates for each reporting unit in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
the preparation of such discounted cash flow estimates requires significant management judgment with respect to operating profit  growth rates  appropriate discount rates and residual values 
based on the initial impairment test as of july   the company determined that goodwill related to its specialty publications division within the publisher services segment was impaired 
the specialty publications division primarily served customers in the special interest magazine market  which had been negatively impacted by the significant downturn in advertising spending as a result of cost reduction initiatives undertaken by advertisers resulting in fewer page counts and correspondingly lower net sales 
in addition  due to excess capacity in the magazine printing industry  volume and pricing pressures also resulted in lower operating profits and cash flows 
as a result  the discounted cash flow analysis for the specialty publications division produced a value that was lower than carrying value 
accordingly  the company recorded an impairment charge of million representing the entire balance of goodwill for this division in the first quarter of fiscal this charge is reflected as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the company has completed annual impairment tests as of april of each year since the adoption of sfas no 
the tests were conducted in a manner consistent with the company s initial impairment test 
as a result of those annual impairment tests  there were no indications of impairment  and no adjustments to the carrying amount of goodwill were required 
the total balance of goodwill as of june  and relates to the company s publisher services segment 
pension and other post retirement benefits 
the company sponsors certain pension and other post retirement plans covering associates who meet eligibility requirements 
several factors are used to 
table of contents calculate the expense and liability related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions determined by the company about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  and rate of future compensation increases 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the impact of these trends on expense and liability amounts 
the economic and actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
while the company believes its assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in the company s assumptions may materially affect its pension and other post retirement obligations and its future expense 
in fiscal  the company s board of directors voted to freeze the cadmus pension plan to mitigate the volatility in pension expense and required cash contributions expected in future years 
the company recorded a million pension curtailment loss in fiscal related to these actions 
the curtailment loss is included in restructuring and other charges in the consolidated statements of operations 
also in fiscal  the company recorded an additional minimum pension liability in accordance with sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions totaling million million net of taxes upon completion of its annual pension valuations 
the adjustment to the additional minimum pension liability was included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a direct charge to shareholders equity  net of related taxes 
during fiscal  equity markets began to recover  resulting in an increase in the fair value of the cadmus pension plan s assets 
the company also made a cash contribution of million to the cadmus pension plan in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of these events  the company recorded a reduction of its minimum pension liability in fiscal in accordance with sfas no 
totaling million million net of taxes upon completion of its annual pension valuations 
the adjustment to the additional minimum pension liability was included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a direct increase to shareholders equity  net of related tax effects 
in fiscal  upon completion of its annual pension valuations the company recorded an additional minimum pension liability in accordance with sfas no 
totaling million million net of taxes 
the adjustment to the additional minimum pension liability was included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a direct charge to shareholders equity  net of related taxes 
the company s contributions to its defined benefit pension plans totaled million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the company does not anticipate having to contribute to its primary defined benefit pension plan in fiscal  but does expect to contribute approximately million to its other defined benefit pension plans in fiscal for the company s primary defined benefit plan  a one percentage point change in the long term rate of return on plan assets would have the following impact on fiscal pension expense and accumulated benefit obligation  respectively percentage point in thousands increase decrease effect on pension expense effect on accumulated benefit obligation for the company s primary defined benefit plan  a one percentage point change in the discount rate would have the following impact on fiscal pension expense and accumulated benefit obligation  respectively percentage point in thousands increase decrease effect on pension expense effect on accumulated benefit obligation 
table of contents changes in the discount rate noted above also impact unrecognized losses  another component of pension expense 
as a result  a one percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate will not have a correspondingly equal impact on overall pension expense 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
in addition to estimating the actual current tax liability  the company must assess future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the company s consolidated balance sheets  and operating loss carryforwards 
such differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
management then assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent recovery is not considered likely  establishes a valuation allowance against those assets 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of future taxable income by jurisdictions in which the company operates and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
judgment is involved in determining the provision for income taxes  the deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax assets 
the company files income tax returns with various state tax jurisdictions in addition to the internal revenue service and is sometimes audited by both federal and state tax agencies 
from time to time  those audits may result in proposed adjustments 
the company has considered these potential adjustments and does not anticipate any material impact on its earnings as a result of the various audits 
to the extent that actual results differ from management s estimates  new information results in changes to estimates  or there is a material change in the actual tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance or adjust the effective tax rate which could materially impact the company s financial position and results of operations 
self insurance reserves 
the company is self insured for both medical and workers compensation claims 
the company engages third party firms to provide claims processing for its medical and workers compensation claims  and to calculate ultimate loss projections relative to its workers compensation claims 
the company records its reserves for medical and workers compensation claims based on the information supplied by the third party firms 
the company s policy is to adjust its workers compensation reserve based on an analysis of individual claims at each reporting date  with considerations of stop loss insurance provisions for both aggregate claim years and individual claims 
the company maintains a medical reserve for claims incurred but not reported based on its best estimate of its ultimate cost of settling all claims incurred as of the reporting date 
actual claims expense  as well as changes in the healthcare cost trends  could result in the company s eventual cost differing from the estimate 
significant transactions restructuring and other expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company initiated a comprehensive equipment upgrade plan to its publisher services print platform and specialty packaging capabilities 
this program is designed to rationalize capacity across the company s manufacturing platform and reorganize operations at several locations 
as a result  certain equipment and related items to be replaced or otherwise disposed of pursuant to this plan were impaired as of june  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company recorded a million million net of taxes impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the publisher services segment and classified the charge as restructuring and other charges in the consolidated statements of operations 
the assets to be replaced or otherwise disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying value or net realizable value as of june  
table of contents additional restructuring costs associated with this equipment upgrade plan  which will include any costs incurred in connection with capacity rationalization among manufacturing facilities and reductions in personnel  will be incurred in fiscal these estimated restructuring costs for the publisher services segment include i one time termination benefits in the range of million to million  ii contract termination costs in the range of million to million  and iii costs to consolidate and reorganize facilities in the range of million to million 
all activities in connection with this plan are expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter in fiscal income taxes during the third quarter of fiscal  cadmus executed a transaction mack benefit related to one of its subsidiaries  mack printing company 
the transaction was an internal restructuring that effectively caused the mack subsidiary to be liquidated for tax purposes 
as a result  the company recognized a tax benefit of approximately million million deferred tax benefit  less million valuation allowance in fiscal although the company believes the actual benefit realized could be significantly larger  it has recorded this amount based on applying reasonable assumptions to the range of possible outcomes in accordance with accounting requirements 
the company is pursuing certain administrative procedures to secure and determine the amount of any such additional benefit
