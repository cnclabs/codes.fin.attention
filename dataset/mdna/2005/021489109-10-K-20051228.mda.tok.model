overview we are a pioneer and market leader in internet protocol telephony systems for small to medium sized businesses 
we design  manufacture and market next generation  internet protocol phone systems and contact centers that use both the internet and the public telephone network to take advantage of the convergence of voice and data communications 
unlike traditional proprietary phone systems  our systems are designed with open architecture and are built on an industry standard platform 
this adherence to industry standards allows our products to play an important role in the small to medium sized business market by delivering phone systems that can integrate with other technologies and provide integrated voice and data solutions 
we believe this enables our customers to implement communication systems that have an increased return versus past technology investments 
we generated net revenues of million  for a net loss of  during fiscal year as of september   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
net cash used in operating activities was  for fiscal year we derive our revenues from sales of our altiserv telephone systems 
product revenues consist of sales to end users including dealers and to distributors 
revenues from product sales to end users and resellers are recognized upon shipment 
we defer recognition of revenue for sales to distributors until they resell our products to their customers 
upon shipment  we also provide a reserve for the estimated cost that may be incurred for product warranty 
under our distribution contracts  a distributor has the right  in certain circumstances  to return products it determines are overstocked  so long as it provides an offsetting purchase order for products in an amount equal to or greater than the dollar value of the returned products 
in addition  we provide distributors protection from subsequent price reductions 
our cost of revenues consists of component and material costs  direct labor costs  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  warranty costs and overhead related to the manufacturing of our products 
several factors that have affected and will continue to affect our revenue growth are the state of economy  the market acceptance of our products  our ability to add new resellers and our ability to design  develop  and release new products 
we engage third party assemblers  which in fiscal year were all quality services and bestronics in san jose  to insert the hardware components into the printed circuit board 
we selected our manufacturing partners with the goals of ensuring a reliable supply of high quality finished products and lowering per unit product costs as a result of manufacturing economies of scale 
we cannot assure you that we will maintain the volumes required to realize these economies of scale or when or if such cost reductions will occur 
the failure to obtain such cost reductions could materially adversely affect our gross margins and operating results 
as of september   we had cumulative net operating loss carry forwards for federal and california income tax reporting purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  available to offset income in future years 
the cumulative net operating loss carry forwards will expire in various periods from to if they are not utilized 
under current tax law  net operating loss carry forwards available in any given year may be limited upon the occurrence of certain events  including changes of ownership interest 
we have not recognized any future tax benefits of our cumulative net operating losses due to uncertainty as to future realization 
we continue to focus on developing enhancements to our current products to provide greater functionality and increased capabilities  based on our market research  customer feedback and our competitors product offerings and creating new product offerings 
in particular  we focus i on developing products that allow us to enhance our position in our target market segment and ii entering new geographical markets 
additionally  we intend to continue to focus on selling our products to small to medium sized businesses and branch offices of larger corporations 
also  we plan to continue to recruit additional resellers and distributors that focus on selling phone systems to our target customers 
we believe that the adoption rate for this internet telephony is much faster with small to medium sized businesses because they have no significant investment on their books for traditional phone systems 
also we believe that small to medium sized businesses are looking for call center type administration to increase the productivity and efficiency of their contacts with customers 
assuming that current market trends  including the continuing acceptance of the call center products  continuing growth in the marketplaces of asia  latin america  caribbean  and the status quo of the north american economy continues and that we are successful in enhancing our products  we expect to see continued revenue growth rate of at least for fiscal year critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
revenues consist of sales to end users  including resellers  and to distributors 
revenues from sales to end users are recognized upon shipment  when risk of loss has passed to the customer  collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the price is fixed and determinable 
sales to distributors are made under terms allowing certain rights of return and protection against subsequent price declines on the our products held by its distributors 
upon termination  any unsold products may be returned by the distributor for a full refund 
these agreements may be canceled by either party based on a specified notice 
as a result of the above provisions  we defer recognition of distributor revenues until such distributors resell our products to their customers 
the amounts deferred as a result of this policy are reflected as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the related cost of revenues is also deferred and reported in the consolidated balance sheets as inventory 
our total deferred revenue was  and  as of september  and september   respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable 
if there were a deterioration of a major customer s creditworthiness  or actual defaults were higher than our historical experience  we could be required to increase our allowance and our earnings could be adversely affected 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  as of september  and september   respectively 
inventory 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
our inventory balance was  and million as of september  and september   respectively 
we regularly review the value of our inventory in detail  with consideration given to future customer demand for our products  obsolescence from rapidly changing technology  and other factors 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  and our estimates prove to be inaccurate  we could be required to increase our inventory provision and our gross margins could be adversely affected 
as of december  altigen had established a reserve to write off million of excess inventory which management believed would not be sold 
during through  altigen reversed a portion of the reserve related to inventory which was sold 
the amount of such reversals were   and  in fiscal years ending  and  respectively 
warranty 
we accrue for warranty costs based on estimated product return rates and the expected material and labor costs to provide warranty services 
if actual return rates and repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates  our gross margin could be adversely affected 
the liability for product warranties was  and  as of september  and september   respectively 
the decrease in accrued warranty was the result of decreases in the product return rate

amortization of deferred stock compensation 
we had no amortization of deferred stock compensation in fiscal year amortization of deferred stock compensation was  in fiscal year deferred stock compensation expense reflects the amortization of stock compensation charges resulting from granting stock options prior to our initial public offering at exercise prices below the deemed fair value of our common stock on the dates the options were granted 
we amortize these deferred amounts using the straight line method over the vesting period of the related stock options 
all remaining deferred stock compensation was amortized in fiscal year interest and other income  net 
net interest and other income decreased to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to the recognition of interest received from full repayment of an outstanding promissory note held by our chief executive officer  gilbert hu  in fiscal year and a decrease in invested principal due to cash being used in operations 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities 
as of september   we had cash and short term investments totaling million consisting of cash and cash equivalents of million with a maturity of less than days and million of short term investment with a maturity of greater than days 
dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term investments total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments percentage of total assets cash used in operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents changes in cash flows during fiscal year  net cash used in operating activities was  which is  higher than the cash used in operating activities during fiscal year due to a net loss of  in fiscal year in fiscal year  our use of cash for non operating activities was primarily attributable to the  of capital spending for internet protocol phone ip tooling development and  of capital spending on equipment additions to support our operations 
as a result  during the twelve months ended september   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased  as compared to september  net accounts receivable remained flat at million for the fiscal year ended september  and due to a slight increase in sales of our products 
we ended the fourth quarter of fiscal year with a cash conversion cycle of days as compared to days for the fourth quarter of fiscal the cash conversion cycle is the duration between purchase of inventories and services and the collection of the cash from the sale of our products and services and is a metric on which we have focused as we continue to try to efficiently manage our assets 
the cash conversion cycle results from the calculation of days of sales outstanding dso added to days of supply in inventories dos  reduced by days of payable outstanding dpo 
inventories decreased to  at september  from million at september  and our annualized inventory turn rate increased to as of september  as compared to times as of september  our annualized inventory turn rate represents the number of times inventory is replenished during the year 
inventory management will continue to be an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 
accounts payable decreased to  at september  from  at september  this decrease primarily was due to a decrease in the number of components purchased at the end of fiscal year as compared to fiscal year our accrued payroll related liabilities decreased to  at september  from  at september   primarily as a result of a decrease in vacation accrual and employee stock purchase plan contribution 
in fiscal year  our net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to the  of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan 
liquidity and capital resources we intend to invest our cash in excess of current operating requirements in short term  interest bearing investment grade securities 
our cash needs depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of and demand for our products  our ability to develop and introduce new products and enhancements to existing products  the prices at which we can sell our products  the resources we devote to developing  marketing  selling and supporting our products  the timing and expense associated with expanding our distribution channels  increases in manufacturing costs and the prices of the components we purchase  as well as other factors 
if we are unable to raise additional capital or if sales from our new products or enhancements are lower than expected  we will be required to make additional reductions in operating expenses and capital expenditures to ensure that we will have adequate cash reserves to fund operations 
additional financing  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
we also may require additional capital to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products  or obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
if we cannot raise needed funds in the future if needed  on acceptable terms  we may not be able to further develop or enhance our products  take advantage of opportunities  or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  which could seriously harm our business 
even if additional financing is available  we may be required to obtain the consent of our stockholders  which we may or may not be able to obtain 
in addition  the issuance of equity or equity related securities will dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders and the issuance of debt securities could increase the risk or perceived risk of investing in our securities 
we do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of september  we have a commitment under our noncancellable capital and operating lease in the amount of million as of september  we believe  we have sufficient cash reserves to allow us to continue operations for more than a year assuming our quarterly cash usage rate does not deteriorate over that period 
our cash and short term investments totaled million as of september   and our quarter ended september  generated  from operating activities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in cash equivalents and short term instruments 
due to the short term nature of our cash equivalents and investments  we have concluded that a change in interest rates does not pose a material market risk to us 
we face foreign exchange currency fluctuations with our subsidiary in china  however  due to the strength in china s economy  we do not foresee foreign exchange currency fluctuations to pose a material market risk to us
