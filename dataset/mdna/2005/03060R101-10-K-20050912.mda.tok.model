item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is a consumer finance company specializing in purchasing retail automobile installment sales contracts originated by franchised and select independent dealers in connection with the sale of used and new automobiles 
the company generates revenue and cash flows primarily through the purchase  retention  subsequent securitization and servicing of finance receivables 
as used herein  loans include auto finance receivables originated by dealers and purchased by the company 
to fund the acquisition of receivables prior to securitization  and to fund the repurchase of receivables pursuant to cleanup call options  the company uses available cash and borrowings under its warehouse credit facilities 
the company earns finance charge income on the finance receivables and pays interest expense on borrowings under its warehouse credit facilities 
the company periodically transfers receivables to securitization trusts trusts that  in turn  sell asset backed securities to investors 
prior to october   these securitization transactions were structured as sales of finance receivables 
receivables sold under this structure are referred to herein as gain on sale receivables 
at june   approximately of the company s managed receivables were gain on sale receivables 
the company retains an interest in these securitization transactions in the form of credit enhancement assets  representing the estimated future excess cash flows expected to be received by the company over the life of the securitization 
excess cash flows result from the difference between the finance charges received from the obligors on the receivables and the interest paid to investors in the asset backed securities  net of credit losses and expenses 
excess cash flows from the trusts are initially utilized to fund credit enhancement requirements in order to attain specific credit ratings for the asset backed securities issued by the trusts 
once predetermined credit enhancement requirements are reached and maintained  excess cash flows are distributed to the company 
credit enhancement requirements will increase if targeted portfolio performance ratios are exceeded see liquidity and capital resources section 
in addition to excess cash flows  the company receives monthly base servicing fees of per annum on the outstanding principal balance of domestic receivables securitized and collects other fees  such as late charges  as servicer for securitization trusts 
the company changed the structure of its securitization transactions beginning with transactions closed subsequent to september   to no longer meet the accounting criteria for sales of finance receivables 
accordingly  following a securitization  the finance receivables and the related securitization notes payable remain on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company recognizes finance charge and fee income on the receivables and interest expense on the securities issued in the securitization transaction  and records a provision for loan losses to cover probable loan losses on the receivables 
this change has significantly impacted the company s reported results of operations compared to its historical results because there is no gain on sale of receivables subsequent to september  the company implemented a revised operating plan in february targeted at preserving and strengthening its capital and liquidity position in light of a weak economic environment and a decline in used car pricing and the resulting breach of cumulative net loss triggers on securitization transactions insured by fsa prior to october the breach of triggers in the fsa program caused a postponement of substantially all of the cash otherwise distributable to the company from its fsa program securitizations as this cash was used to fund increased credit enhancement requirements on fsa program securitizations 
the revised operating plan included a decrease in the company s targeted loan origination volume and a reduction in operating expenses through downsizing its workforce  consolidating its branch office network and closing its canadian lending activities 
the stated objectives of the plan were substantially met by the end of calendar in the first half of calendar  the company resumed growth in its loan origination targets and has since added staff to its branch office network and related areas to support new loan growth 
the company intends to continue to expand loan origination volume at a moderate pace during fiscal 
table of contents recent developments in late august  hurricane katrina struck the gulf coast  causing extensive damage 
collateral supporting finance receivables in certain parts of alabama  louisiana and mississippi may have been damaged by the storm 
additionally  there may be a period of higher unemployment in areas affected by the storm 
approximately of managed receivables are secured by automobiles located in the affected areas 
on august   the company announced that daniel e 
berce had been named the company s chief executive officer 
mr 
berce  who has served as the company s president since  will now serve as president and chief executive officer 
as chief executive officer  mr 
berce succeeds clifton h

critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of revenue and costs and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates and those differences may be material 
the accounting estimates that the company believes are the most critical to understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results include the following allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established systematically based on the determination of the amount of probable credit losses inherent in the finance receivables as of the reporting date 
the company reviews charge off experience factors  delinquency reports  historical collection rates  estimates of the value of the underlying collateral  economic trends  such as unemployment rates  and other information in order to make the necessary judgments as to the probable credit losses 
the company also uses historical charge off experience to determine a loss confirmation period  which is defined as the time between when an event  such as delinquency status  giving rise to a probable credit loss occurs with respect to a specific account and when such account is charged off 
this loss confirmation period is applied to the forecasted probable credit losses to determine the amount of losses inherent in finance receivables at the reporting date 
assumptions regarding credit losses and loss confirmation periods are reviewed periodically and may be impacted by actual performance of finance receivables and changes in any of the factors discussed above 
should the credit loss assumption or loss confirmation period increase  there could be an increase in the amount of allowance for loan losses required  which could decrease the net carrying value of finance receivables and increase the amount of provision for loan losses recorded on the consolidated statements of income 
a and increase in cumulative net credit losses over the loss confirmation period would increase the allowance for loan losses as of june   as follows in thousands adverse change adverse change impact on allowance for loan losses the company believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover probable losses inherent in its receivables  however  because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  there can be no assurance that the ultimate charge off amount will not exceed such estimates or that the company s credit loss assumptions will not increase 
gain on sale of receivables the company periodically transfers receivables to trusts that  in turn  sell asset backed securities to investors 
prior to october   the company recognized a gain on the sale of receivables to the trusts  which represented the difference between the sale proceeds to the company  net of transaction costs  and the 
table of contents company s net carrying value of the receivables  plus the present value of the estimated future excess cash flows to be received by the company over the life of the securitization 
the company has made assumptions in order to determine the present value of the estimated future excess cash flows to be generated by the pool of receivables sold 
the most significant assumptions made are the cumulative credit losses to be incurred on the pool of receivables sold  the timing of those losses and the rate at which the estimated future excess cash flows are discounted 
significant assumptions used in determining the gain on sale of auto receivables were as follows years ended june  cumulative credit losses discount rate used to estimate present value interest only receivables from trusts investments in trust receivables restricted cash gain on sale trusts the cumulative credit loss assumptions utilized at the time of sale of receivables were determined using a range of possible outcomes based on historical experience  credit attributes for the specific pool of receivables and general economic factors 
the cumulative credit loss assumption reflects the approximate level that cumulative credit losses could reach notwithstanding other assumptions in a securitization pool before the credit enhancement assets would suffer an other than temporary impairment 
the discount rates used to estimate the present value of credit enhancement assets are based on the relative risks of each asset type 
interest only receivables from trusts represent estimated future excess cash flows in the trusts and have a first loss position to absorb any shortfall in trust cash flows due to adverse credit loss development or adverse changes in trust performance relative to other assumptions 
while the company earns a higher yield on its securitized receivables  the company utilizes a discount rate for interest only receivables from trusts since net undiscounted estimated future excess cash flows already incorporate a default assumption and the receivables underlying the securitization represent a diverse pool of assets 
restricted cash gain on sale trusts and investments in trust receivables represent cash and finance receivables held by the trusts and are senior to interest only receivables from trusts for credit enhancement purposes 
accordingly  restricted cash gain on sale trusts and investments in trust receivables are assigned a lower discount rate than the interest only receivables from trusts 
the assumptions used represent the company s best estimates 
the use of different assumptions would produce different financial results 
credit enhancement assets the company s credit enhancement assets  which represent retained interests in securitization trusts accounted for as sales  are recorded at fair value 
because market prices are not readily available for the credit enhancement assets  fair value is determined using discounted cash flow models 
the most significant assumptions made are the cumulative net credit losses to be incurred on the pool of receivables sold  the timing of those losses and the rate at which estimated future excess cash flows are discounted 
the assumptions used represent the company s best estimates 
the assumptions may change in future periods due to changes in the economy that may impact the performance of the company s finance receivables and the risk profiles of its credit enhancement assets 
the use of different assumptions would result in different carrying values for the company s credit enhancement assets and may change the amount of accretion of present value discount and impairment of credit enhancement assets recognized through the consolidated statements of income 
an immediate and adverse change in the assumptions used to measure the fair value of credit enhancement assets would decrease the credit enhancement assets as of june   as follows in thousands impact on fair value of adverse change adverse change expected cumulative net credit losses discount rate 
table of contents the adverse changes to the key assumptions and estimates are hypothetical 
the change in fair value based on the above variations in assumptions cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear 
also  in this table  the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on fair value is calculated independently from any change in another assumption 
in reality  changes in one factor may contribute to changes in another  which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities 
furthermore  due to potential changes in current economic conditions  the estimated fair values as disclosed should not be considered indicative of the future performance of these assets 
the sensitivities do not reflect actions management might take to offset the impact of any adverse change 
stock based employee compensation on july   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  prospectively for all awards granted or modified subsequent to june  the fair value of each option granted or modified was estimated using an option pricing model based on the following weighted average assumptions year ended june  expected dividends expected volatility risk free interest rate expected life years years these assumptions are reviewed each time there is a new grant or modification of a previous grant and may be impacted by actual fluctuation in the company s stock price  movements in market interest rates and option terms 
the use of different assumptions would produce a different fair value for the options granted or modified and would impact the amount of compensation expense recognized on the consolidated statements of income 
the impact of a or increase in the company s assumptions of volatility  risk free interest rate and expected life on the amount of compensation expense recognized would not have been material for fiscal and the company has separately disclosed the impact of sfas r  which effects the manner by which assumptions are determined for compensation expense 
results of operations year ended june  as compared to year ended june  revenue a summary of changes in the company s finance receivables is as follows in thousands years ended june  balance at beginning of period loans purchased loans repurchased from gain on sale trusts liquidations and other balance at end of period average finance receivables the increase in loans purchased during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to the addition of staff in the company s branch office network and related areas in order to support new loan growth 
the increase in liquidations and other resulted primarily from increased collections and charge offs on finance receivables due to the increase in average finance receivables and average age  or seasoning  of the portfolio 
as of june  and  the company operated branch offices 

table of contents the average new loan size was  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the average annual percentage rate for finance receivables purchased during fiscal increased to from during fiscal due to an increase in new loan pricing as a result of an increase in short term market interest rates 
finance charge income increased by to  million for fiscal from million for fiscal  primarily due to the increase in average finance receivables 
the company s effective yield on its finance receivables increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the effective yield represents finance charges and fees taken into earnings during the period as a percentage of average finance receivables and is lower than the contractual rates of the company s auto finance contracts due to finance receivables in nonaccrual status 
the increase in the effective yield is primarily due to the accretion of acquisition fees on loans acquired subsequent to june   due to the company s adoption of statement of position  accounting for certain loans on debt securities acquired in a transfer sop 
servicing income consists of the following in thousands years ended june  servicing fees other than temporary impairment accretion average gain on sale receivables servicing fees are earned from servicing domestic finance receivables sold to gain on sale trusts 
servicing fees decreased as a result of the decrease in average gain on sale receivables caused by the change in the company s securitization transaction structure from gain on sale to secured financing 
servicing fees were and of average gain on sale receivables for fiscal and  respectively 
other than temporary impairment of million and million for fiscal and  respectively  resulted from higher than forecasted default rates in certain gain on sale trusts 
other than temporary impairment decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of seasoning of the gain on sale receivables which generally provides for greater predictability of default rates 
the present value discount related to the company s credit enhancement assets represents the risk adjusted time value of money on estimated cash flows 
the present value discount on credit enhancement assets is accreted into earnings over the life of credit enhancement assets using the effective interest method 
additionally  unrealized gains on credit enhancement assets reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income are also accreted into earnings over the life of the credit enhancement assets using the effective interest method 
the company recognized accretion of million  or of average credit enhancement assets  and million  or of average credit enhancement assets  during fiscal and  respectively 
the company does not record accretion in a period when such accretion would cause an other than temporary impairment in a securitization pool 
accretion as a percentage of average credit enhancements was higher during fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of fewer securitization transactions incurring other than temporary impairments 
other income was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the increase in other income is primarily due to an increase in investment income  which resulted from higher cash balances combined with increased interest rates  and an increase in late fees and other fees associated with higher average finance receivables 

table of contents costs and expenses operating expenses decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal operating expenses declined primarily as a result of lower costs to service a declining portfolio  partially offset by increased costs to support greater loan origination volume 
the company recognized million and million in restructuring charges for fiscal and  respectively 
the restructuring charges for fiscal consisted primarily of a revision of assumed lease costs for office space and collections centers in connection with the company s restructuring activities in fiscal and continued into fiscal the restructuring charges for fiscal consisted primarily of facility costs related to the closing of the company s jacksonville collections center  the elimination of excess space at its chandler collections center and corporate headquarters  as well as adjustments to the restructuring charges related to the company s implementation of a revised operating plan in february provisions for loan losses are charged to income to bring the company s allowance for loan losses to a level which management considers adequate to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio of finance receivables 
the provision for loan losses recorded for fiscal and reflect inherent losses on receivables originated during those years and changes in the amount of inherent losses on receivables originated in prior years 
the provision for loan losses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily as a result of increased origination volume in fiscal as a percentage of average finance receivables  the provision for loan losses was and for fiscal and  respectively 
the provision for loan losses as a percentage of average finance receivables was higher for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  due to the company s adoption of sop  for loans acquired subsequent to june  under sop  dealer acquisition fees on loans purchased by the company are no longer considered credit related because there is no deterioration in credit quality between the time the loan is originated and when it is acquired 
accordingly  dealer acquisition fees reduce the carrying value of finance receivables and are accreted into earnings as an adjustment to yield over the life of the loans  instead of being used to cover losses inherent in the portfolio 
this change resulted in a higher provision for loan losses in fiscal in order to maintain an appropriate level of allowance for loan losses 
interest expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal average debt outstanding was  million and  million for fiscal and  respectively 
the company s effective rate of interest paid on the company s debt for fiscal was 
the effective rate of interest paid on the company s debt for fiscal was  excluding the recognition of million of deferred debt issuance costs related to the whole loan purchase facility that was repaid in september the company s effective income tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal the decrease in the company s effective income tax rate resulted from a change in the mix of business due to organizational restructuring and other changes that reduced federal and state tax exposures 
other comprehensive loss income other comprehensive loss income consisted of the following in thousands years ended june  unrealized losses gains on credit enhancement assets unrealized gains on cash flow hedges canadian currency translation adjustment income tax benefit provision 
table of contents credit enhancement assets unrealized losses gains on credit enhancement assets consisted of the following in thousands years ended june  unrealized losses gains related to changes in credit loss assumptions unrealized gains related to changes in interest rates reclassification of unrealized gains into earnings through accretion changes in the fair value of credit enhancement assets as a result of modifications to the credit loss assumptions are reported as unrealized gains in other comprehensive income loss until realized 
unrealized losses are reported as a reduction in unrealized gains to the extent that there are unrealized gains 
if there are no unrealized gains to offset the unrealized losses  the losses are considered to be other than temporary and are charged to operations 
the cumulative credit loss assumptions used to estimate the fair value of credit enhancement assets are periodically reviewed by the company and modified to reflect the actual credit performance for each securitization pool through the reporting date as well as estimates of future losses considering several factors including changes in the general economy 
differences between cumulative credit loss assumptions used in individual securitization pools can be attributed to the original credit attributes of a pool  actual credit performance through the reporting date and pool seasoning to the extent that changes in economic trends will have more of an impact on the expected future performance of less seasoned pools 
the company changed the cumulative credit loss assumptions used in measuring the fair value of credit enhancement assets to a range of to as of june   from a range of to as of june  on a trust by trust basis  certain trusts experienced better than expected credit performance for fiscal and decreased cumulative credit loss assumptions 
certain other trusts experienced worse than expected credit performance for fiscal and increased cumulative credit loss assumptions 
the net impact resulted in the recognition of unrealized losses of million for those securitization trusts as well as other than temporary impairment of million 
the company increased the cumulative credit loss assumptions used in measuring the fair value of credit enhancement assets to a range of to as of june   from a range of to as of june  for fiscal  certain trusts experienced better than expected credit performance and decreased cumulative credit loss assumptions resulting in the recognition of unrealized gains of million for those securitization trusts  while other trusts experienced worse than expected credit performance and increased cumulative credit loss assumptions  resulting in the recognition of other than temporary impairment of million 
unrealized gains related to changes in interest rates of million and million for fiscal and  respectively  resulted primarily from an increase in estimated future cash flows to be generated from investment income earned on the restricted cash and trust collection accounts due to an increase in forward interest rate expectations 
net unrealized gains of million and million were reclassified into earnings through accretion during fiscal and  respectively  and relate primarily to recognition of actual excess cash collected over the company s prior estimate 
cash flow hedges unrealized gains on cash flow hedges consisted of the following in thousands years ended june  unrealized gains related to changes in fair value reclassification of unrealized losses into earnings 
table of contents unrealized gains related to changes in the fair value for fiscal and  were primarily due to changes in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements  including the interest rate swap agreements executed in january related to the company s medium term note facility  that were designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements fluctuate based upon changes in forward interest rate expectations 
unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges of the company s credit enhancement assets are reclassified into earnings when unrealized gains or losses related to interest rate fluctuations on the company s credit enhancement assets are reclassified 
however  if the company expects that the continued reporting of a loss in accumulated other comprehensive income would lead to recognizing a net loss on the combination of the interest rate swap agreements and the credit enhancement assets  the loss is reclassified to earnings for the amount that is not expected to be recovered 
unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges of the company s floating rate debt are reclassified into earnings when interest rate fluctuations on securitization notes payable or other hedged items affect earnings 
canadian currency translation adjustment canadian currency translation adjustment gains of million and million for fiscal and  respectively  were included in other comprehensive loss income 
the translation adjustment gains are due to the increase in the value of the company s canadian dollar denominated assets related to the decline in the us dollar to canadian dollar conversion rates 
the company does not anticipate the settlement of intercompany transactions with its canadian subsidiaries in the foreseeable future 
net margin net margin is the difference between finance charge and other income earned on the company s receivables and the cost to fund the receivables as well as the cost of debt incurred for general corporate purposes

table of contents the company evaluates the profitability of its lending activities based partly upon the net margin related to its managed auto loan portfolio  including finance receivables and gain on sale receivables 
the company uses this information to analyze trends in the components of the profitability of its managed auto portfolio 
analysis of net margin on a managed basis allows the company to determine which origination channels and loan products are most profitable  guides the company in making pricing decisions for loan products and indicates if sufficient spread exists between the company s revenues and cost of funds to cover operating expenses and achieve corporate profitability objectives 
additionally  net margin on a managed basis facilitates comparisons of results between the company and other finance companies i that do not securitize their receivables or ii have not structured any securitizations to qualify for gain on sale accounting treatment 
the company routinely securitizes its receivables and prior to october   recorded a gain on the sale of such receivables 
the net margin on a managed basis presented below assumes that all securitized receivables have not been sold and are still on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
accordingly  no servicing income would have been recognized 
instead  finance charges would be recognized over the life of the securitized receivables as earned  and interest and other costs related to the asset backed securities would be recognized as incurred

net margin net margin is the difference between finance charge and other income earned on the company s receivables and the cost to fund the receivables as well as the cost of debt incurred for general corporate purposes

the company uses this information to analyze trends in the components of the profitability of its managed auto portfolio 
analysis of net margin on a managed basis allows the company to determine which origination channels and loan products are most profitable  guides the company in making pricing decisions for loan products and indicates if sufficient spread exists between the company s revenues and cost of funds to cover operating expenses and achieve corporate profitability objectives 
additionally  net margin on a managed basis facilitates comparisons of results between the company and other finance companies i that do not securitize their receivables or ii have not structured any securitizations to qualify for gain on sale accounting treatment 

table of contents the company routinely securitizes its receivables and prior to october   recorded a gain on the sale of such receivables 
the net margin on a managed basis presented below assumes that all securitized receivables have not been sold and are still on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
accordingly  no gain on sale or servicing income would have been recognized 
instead  finance charges would be recognized over the life of the securitized receivables as earned  and interest and other costs related to the asset backed securities would be recognized as incurred 
average managed receivables consists of finance receivables held by the company and finance receivables sold to the company s securitization trusts in transactions accounted for as sales 
the company s average managed receivables outstanding are as follows in thousands years ended june  finance receivables gain on sale receivables average managed receivables average managed receivables outstanding decreased by because collections and other liquidations of the company s managed receivables have exceeded new loan purchase volume since implementation of the revised operating plan in february net margin for the company s managed finance receivables portfolio is as follows in thousands years ended june  finance charge income other income interest expense net margin net margin as a percentage of average managed finance receivables outstanding is as follows years ended june  finance charge income other income interest expense net margin as a percentage of average managed auto receivables the following is a reconciliation of finance charge income as reflected on the company s consolidated statements of income to the company s managed basis finance charge income in thousands years ended june  finance charge income per consolidated statements of income adjustments to reflect finance charge income earned on receivables in gain on sale trusts managed basis finance charge income

finance receivables on the company s balance sheets include receivables purchased but not yet securitized and receivables securitized by the company after september  provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses on the balance sheet at a level considered adequate to cover probable credit losses inherent in finance receivables 
prior to october   the company periodically sold receivables to trusts in securitization transactions accounted for as a sale of receivables and retained an interest in the receivables sold in the form of credit enhancement assets 
credit enhancement assets are reflected on the company s balance sheet at estimated fair value  calculated based upon the present value of estimated excess future cash flows from the trusts using  among other assumptions  estimates of future credit losses on the receivables sold 
receivables sold to trusts that are subsequently charged off decrease the amount of excess future cash flows from the trusts 
if such charge offs are expected to exceed the company s estimates of cumulative credit losses or if the actual timing of these losses differs from expected timing  the fair value of credit enhancement assets is written down through an other than temporary impairment charge to earnings to the extent the write down exceeds any previously recorded unrealized gain

delinquencies in the company s managed receivables portfolio may vary from period to period based upon the average age or seasoning of the portfolio  seasonality within the calendar year and economic factors 
due to the company s target customer base  a relatively high percentage of accounts become delinquent at some point in the life of a loan and there is a high rate of account movement between current and delinquent status in the portfolio 
the company has experienced improved credit performance on loans originated since february a greater percentage of total managed finance receivables at june   as compared to that same percentage at june   were originated since february accordingly  total managed finance receivables to days and greater than days delinquent were lower at june   as compared to june  delinquencies in finance receivables are lower than delinquencies in gain on sale receivables due to improved credit performance on loans originated since the implementation of a revised operating plan in february as well as the relative lower overall seasoning of such finance receivables 
delinquencies in finance receivables were higher at june   as compared to june   as a result of seasoning of the finance receivables 
deferrals in accordance with its policies and guidelines  the company  at times  offers payment deferrals to consumers  whereby the consumer is allowed to move up to two delinquent payments to the end of the loan generally by paying a fee approximately the interest portion of the payment deferred  except where state law provides for a lesser amount 
the company s policies and guidelines  as well as certain contractual restrictions in the company s warehouse credit facilities and securitization transactions  limit the number and frequency of deferments that may be granted 
the company s policies and guidelines generally limit the granting of deferments on new accounts until a requisite number of payments have been received 
due to the nature of the company s customer base and policies and guidelines of the deferral program  approximately of accounts currently comprising the managed portfolio will receive a deferral at some point in the life of the account 

table of contents an account for which all delinquent payments are deferred is classified as current at the time the deferment is granted and therefore is not included as a delinquent account 
thereafter  such account is aged based on the timely payment of future installments in the same manner as any other account 
contracts receiving a payment deferral as an average quarterly percentage of average managed receivables outstanding were as follows years ended june  finance receivables as a percentage of average finance receivables gain on sale receivables as a percentage of average gain on sale receivables total managed portfolio as a percentage of average managed receivables the following is a summary of total deferrals as a percentage of managed receivables outstanding june  finance receivables gain on sale total managed never deferred deferred times times greater than times total deferred total june  finance receivables gain on sale total managed never deferred deferred times times greater than times total deferred total the percentage of loans deferred is greater for the company s gain on sale receivables as compared to its finance receivables as a result of seasoning of the gain on sale receivables as well as overall improved credit performance on loans originated since the implementation of the company s revised operating plan in february the company evaluates the results of its deferment strategies based upon the amount of cash installments that are collected on accounts after they have been deferred versus the extent to which the collateral underlying the deferred accounts has depreciated over the same period of time 
based on this evaluation  the company believes that payment deferrals granted according to its policies and guidelines are an effective portfolio management technique and result in higher ultimate cash collections from the portfolio 
changes in deferment levels do not have a direct impact on the ultimate amount of finance receivables charged off by the company 
however  the timing of a charge off may be affected if the previously deferred account ultimately results in a charge off 
to the extent that deferrals impact the ultimate timing of when an account is charged off  historical charge off ratios and loss confirmation periods used in the determination of the 
table of contents adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses are also impacted 
increased use of deferrals may result in a lengthening of the loss confirmation period  which would increase expectations of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and therefore increase the allowance for loan losses and related provision for loan losses 
changes in these ratios and periods are considered in determining the appropriate level of allowance for loan losses and related provision for loan losses 
charge offs the following table presents charge off data with respect to the company s managed finance receivables portfolio dollars in thousands years ended june  finance receivables repossession charge offs less recoveries mandatory charge offs a net charge offs gain on sale repossession charge offs less recoveries mandatory charge offs a net charge offs total managed repossession charge offs less recoveries mandatory charge offs a net charge offs net charge offs as an annualized percentage of average receivables finance receivables gain on sale receivables total managed portfolio recoveries as a percentage of gross repossession charge offs finance receivables gain on sale receivables total managed portfolio a mandatory charge offs represent accounts days delinquent that are charged off in full with no recovery amounts realized at time of charge off and the change during the period in the aggregate write down of finance receivables in repossession to the net realizable value of the repossessed vehicle when the repossessed vehicle is legally available for sale 
net charge offs as a percentage of average managed receivables outstanding may vary from period to period based upon the average age or seasoning of the portfolio and economic factors 
the decrease in net charge offs for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  resulted primarily from improved credit performance on loans originated since the implementation of the company s revised operating plan in february and a declining managed portfolio balance  combined with an overall improvement in recovery rates 
the increase in net charge offs for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  resulted primarily from the company s change in repossession charge off policy during fiscal and weakness in the economy during the first half of fiscal prior to december   receivables were charged off when the company repossessed and disposed of the automobile or the account was otherwise deemed uncollectible 
in implementing the new repossession charge off policy  the company incurred additional charge offs of million in fiscal related to the acceleration of charge off timing for certain accounts already repossessed 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources general the company s primary sources of cash are finance charge income  servicing fees  distributions from securitization trusts  issuances of senior notes and equity  borrowings under warehouse credit facilities  transfers of finance receivables to trusts in securitization transactions and collections and recoveries on finance receivables 
the company s primary uses of cash have been purchases of finance receivables  repayment of warehouse credit facilities  securitization notes payable and senior notes  funding credit enhancement requirements for securitization transactions  operating expenses  income taxes and stock repurchases 
the company used cash of  million   million and  million for the purchase of finance receivables during fiscal  and  respectively 
these purchases were funded initially utilizing cash and warehouse credit facilities and subsequently the long term financing of finance receivables in securitization transactions as well as  in fiscal  through the sale of receivables under a whole loan purchase facility 
warehouse credit facilities in the normal course of business  in addition to using its available cash  the company pledges receivables and borrows under its warehouse credit facilities to fund its operations and repays these borrowings as appropriate under its cash management strategy 
as of june   warehouse credit facilities consisted of the following in millions facility type maturity facility amount advances outstanding commercial paper facility november a b  medium term note facility october a c repurchase facility august a near prime facility january a a at the maturity date  the outstanding debt balance can either be repaid in full or over time based on the amortization of receivables pledged 
b million of this facility matures in november  and the remaining  million matures in november c this facility is a revolving facility through the date stated above 
during the revolving period  the company has the ability to substitute receivables for cash  or vice versa 
in august  the company entered into the million repurchase facility pursuant to which the company can finance the repurchase of finance receivables from securitization trusts upon exercise of the cleanup call option 
subsequent to june   the company amended the agreement to increase the facility limit to million and extended its maturity to august in october  the company terminated a million medium term note facility and entered into the million medium term note facility 
in november  the company renewed its  million commercial paper facility  extending the million one year maturity to november and the  million three year maturity to november in january  the company entered into the million near prime facility to fund higher credit quality receivables 
subsequent to june   the company amended the agreement to increase the facility limit to million and extended its maturity to july 
table of contents the company s warehouse credit facilities contain various covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios  asset quality and portfolio performance ratios cumulative net loss  delinquency and repossession ratios as well as limits on deferment levels 
failure to meet any of these covenants could result in an event of default under these agreements 
if an event of default occurs under these agreements  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under these agreements to be immediately due and payable  enforce their interests against collateral pledged under these agreements or restrict the company s ability to obtain additional borrowings under these agreements 
as of june   the company s warehouse credit facilities were in compliance with all covenants 
whole loan purchase facility in march  the company entered into a whole loan purchase facility with an original term of approximately four years under which the company transferred billion of finance receivables to a special purpose finance subsidiary of the company and received an advance of million from the purchaser 
additionally  the company issued a million note to the purchaser representing debt issuance costs in the form of a residual interest in the finance receivables transferred 
in september  the company terminated the whole loan purchase facility 
convertible senior notes in november  the company issued million of contingently convertible senior notes that are due in november interest on the notes is payable semiannually at a rate of per annum 
the notes  which are uncollateralized  are convertible prior to maturity into shares of the company s common stock at per share 
additionally  the company may exercise its option to repurchase the notes  or holders of the convertible senior notes may require the company to repurchase the notes  on november   at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes redeemed  or after november  at par 
in conjunction with the issuance of the convertible senior notes  the company purchased a call option that entitles it to purchase shares of the company s stock in an amount equal to the number of shares convertible at per share 
this call option allows the company to offset the dilution of its shares if the conversion feature of the senior convertible notes is exercised 
the company also issued warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock

prior to october   the company structured its securitization transactions to meet the accounting criteria for sales of finance receivables under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the company changed the structure of securitization transactions completed subsequent to september   to no longer meet the accounting criteria for sale of finance receivables 
accordingly  following a securitization  the finance receivables are transferred to a securitization trust  which is a special purpose finance subsidiary of americredit corp 
the related securitization notes payable issued by these trusts remain on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
while these trusts are included in the company s consolidated financial statements  these trusts are separate legal entities  thus the finance receivables and other assets held by these trusts are legally owned by these trusts  are available to satisfy the related securitization notes payable and are 
table of contents not available to creditors of americredit corp 
or its other subsidiaries 
this change in securitization structure does not change the company s requirement to provide credit enhancement in order to attain specific credit ratings for the asset backed securities issued by the trusts 
the company typically makes an initial deposit to a restricted cash account and transfers finance receivables in excess of the amount of asset backed securities issued to create initial overcollateralization 
the company subsequently uses excess cash flows generated by the trusts to either increase the restricted cash account or repay the outstanding asset backed securities on an accelerated basis  thereby creating additional credit enhancement through overcollateralization in the trusts 
when the credit enhancement levels reach specified percentages of the trust s pool of receivables  excess cash flows are distributed to the company 
the company employs two types of securitization structures to meet its credit enhancement requirements 
the structure the company has utilized most frequently involves the purchase of a financial guaranty policy issued by an insurer to cover the asset backed securities and may include the use of reinsurance or other alternative credit enhancement products to reduce the required initial deposit to the restricted cash account and initial overcollateralization 
however  the company currently has no outstanding commitments to obtain reinsurance or other alternative credit enhancement products and will likely provide initial credit enhancement deposits in future securitization transactions from its existing capital resources 
the company s second type of securitization structure involves the sale of subordinated asset backed securities in order to provide credit enhancement for the senior asset backed securities 
the subordinated asset backed securities replace a portion of the company s credit enhancement required in a securitization transaction in a manner similar to the utilization of insurance or other alternative credit enhancements described in the preceding paragraph 
the company s most recent securitization transaction completed in august covered by a financial guaranty insurance policy required an initial cash deposit and overcollateralization level of of the original receivable pool balance  and target credit enhancement levels must reach of the receivable pool balance before cash is distributed to the company 
under this structure  the company typically expects to begin to receive cash distributions approximately five to eight months after receivables are securitized 
securitization transactions covered by financial guaranty insurance policies completed in calendar year  calendar year and until the most recent transaction had initial cash deposits and overcollateralization levels between and and contained target credit enhancement levels of to 
increases or decreases to the credit enhancement level on future securitization transactions will depend on the net interest margin  credit performance trends of the company s finance receivables  the company s financial condition and the economic environment 
the company believes that additional securitizations to be completed in fiscal will require initial cash and overcollateralization levels and target credit enhancement levels similar to levels in its most recent securitization transaction 
cash flows related to securitization transactions were as follows in millions years ended june  initial credit enhancement deposits gain on sale trusts restricted cash overcollateralization secured financing trusts restricted cash overcollateralization distributions from trusts  net of swap payments gain on sale trusts secured financing trusts 
table of contents with respect to the company s securitization transactions covered by a financial guaranty insurance policy  agreements with the insurers provide that if portfolio performance ratios delinquency  cumulative default or cumulative net loss triggers in a trust s pool of receivables exceed certain targets  the specified credit enhancement levels would be increased 
prior to october  the financial guaranty insurance policies for all of the company s insured securitization transactions were provided by fsa 
the restricted cash account for each securitization trust insured as part of the fsa program was cross collateralized to the restricted cash accounts established in connection with the company s other securitization trusts in the fsa program  such that excess cash flows from an fsa program securitization that had already met its own credit enhancement requirement could be used to fund target credit enhancement requirements with respect to fsa program securitizations in which specified portfolio performance ratios had been exceeded  rather than being distributed to the company 
the company s securitization transactions insured by financial guaranty insurance providers  including fsa  since october are cross collateralized to a more limited extent 
in the event of a shortfall in the original target credit enhancement requirement for any of these securitization trusts after a certain period of time  excess cash flows from other transactions insured by the same insurance provider would be used to satisfy the shortfall amount 
in one of the company s securitization transactions  if a secured party receives a notice of a rating agency review for downgrade or if there is a downgrade of any class of notes without taking into consideration the presence of the financial guaranty insurance policy excess cash flows from other securitization transactions insured by the same insurance provider would be utilized to satisfy any increased target credit enhancement requirements 
as of june   the company had exceeded its targeted cumulative net loss triggers in six of the seven remaining fsa program securitizations 
accordingly  cash of approximately million generated by fsa program securitizations otherwise distributable to the company was used to fund increased credit enhancement levels for the securitizations that breached their cumulative net loss triggers 
the higher targeted credit enhancement levels have been reached and maintained in each of these six fsa program securitizations 
the remaining fsa program securitization breached its cumulative net loss trigger as of june   and fsa granted a waiver 
additionally  the company received a waiver for july and august  however  the company cannot guarantee that fsa will continue to grant a waiver  if a waiver is not granted  the credit enhancement level for such securitization would have increased by million as of august  the impact of any delay in the amount of cash to be released to the company during fiscal is not expected to be material to the company s liquidity position 
the agreements that the company enters into with its financial guaranty insurance providers in connection with securitization transactions contain additional specified targeted portfolio performance ratios delinquency  cumulative default and cumulative net loss triggers that are higher than the limits referred to above 
if  at any measurement date  the targeted portfolio performance ratios with respect to any insured trust were to exceed these additional levels  provisions of the agreements permit the financial guaranty insurance providers to terminate the company s servicing rights to the receivables sold to that trust 
in addition  the servicing agreements on certain insured securitization trusts are cross defaulted so that a default under one servicing agreement would allow the financial guaranty insurance provider to terminate the company s servicing rights under all servicing agreements for securitization trusts in which they issued a financial guaranty insurance policy 
additionally  if these higher targeted portfolio performance levels were exceeded  the financial guaranty insurance providers may elect to retain all excess cash generated by other securitization transactions insured by them as additional credit enhancement 
this  in turn  could result in defaults under the company s other securitizations and other material indebtedness 
although the company has never exceeded these additional targeted portfolio performance ratios  and does not anticipate violating any event of default triggers for its securitizations  there can be no assurance that the company s servicing rights with respect to the automobile receivables in such trusts or any other trusts will not be terminated if i such targeted portfolio performance ratios are breached  ii the company breaches its obligations under the servicing agreements  iii the financial guaranty insurance providers are required to make payments under a policy  or iv certain bankruptcy or insolvency events were to occur 
as of june   no such termination events have occurred with respect to any of the trusts formed by the company 

table of contents stock repurchases during fiscal  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock  at an average cost of per share  under stock repurchase plans approved by the board of directors since april as of june   the existing stock repurchase plan authorizes the company to repurchase another million of its common stock 
during july and august  the company repurchased an additional  shares of its common stock  at an average cost of per share 
as of august   the remaining stock repurchase plan authorizes the company to repurchase another million of its common stock 
operating plan the company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to achieve its growth strategies in fiscal as of june   the company had unrestricted cash balances of million 
assuming that origination volume ranges from billion to billion in fiscal and the initial credit enhancement requirement for the company s securitization transactions remains at the level for the most recent securitization completed in august  the company would require million to million in cash or liquidity to fund initial credit enhancement in fiscal the company expects that cash distributions from its securitization transactions will exceed the funding requirement for initial credit enhancement deposits for fiscal the company will continue to require the execution of additional securitization transactions in fiscal there can be no assurance that funding will be available to the company through the execution of securitization transactions or  if available  that the funding will be on acceptable terms 
if the company is unable to execute securitization transactions on a regular basis  and was otherwise unable to issue any other debt or equity  it would not have sufficient funds to finance new loan originations and  in such event  the company would be required to revise the scale of its business  including possible discontinuation of loan origination activities  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to achieve its business and financial objectives 
off balance sheet arrangements prior to october   the company structured its securitization transactions to meet the accounting criteria for sales of finance receivables 
under this structure  notes issued by the company s unconsolidated qualified special purpose finance subsidiaries are not recorded as liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
see liquidity and capital resources securitization for a detailed discussion of the company s securitization transactions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk fluctuations in market interest rates impact the company s warehouse credit facilities and securitization transactions 
the company s gross interest rate spread  which is the difference between interest earned on its finance receivables and interest paid  is affected by changes in interest rates as a result of the company s dependence upon the issuance of variable rate securities and the incurrence of variable rate debt to fund its purchases of finance receivables 
warehouse credit facilities finance receivables purchased by the company and pledged to secure borrowings under its warehouse credit facilities bear fixed interest rates 
amounts borrowed under the company s warehouse credit facilities bear interest at variable rates that are subject to frequent adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates 
to protect the interest rate spread within each warehouse credit facility  the company s special purpose finance subsidiaries are contractually required to purchase interest rate cap agreements in connection with borrowings under the company s warehouse credit facilities 
the purchaser of the interest rate cap agreement pays a premium in return for the right to receive the difference in the interest cost at any time a specified index of market interest rates rises above the stipulated cap rate 
the purchaser of the interest rate cap agreement bears no obligation or liability if interest rates fall below the cap rate 
as part of the company s interest rate risk 
table of contents management strategy and when economically feasible  the company may simultaneously sell a corresponding interest rate cap agreement in order to offset the premium paid by its special purpose finance subsidiary to purchase the interest rate cap agreement and thus retain the interest rate risk 
the fair value of the interest rate cap agreement purchased by the special purpose finance subsidiary is included in other assets and the fair value of the interest rate cap agreement sold by the company is included in derivative financial instruments on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
in january  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability in interest payments on its medium term notes facility caused by fluctuations in the benchmark interest rate 
these interest rate swap agreements are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 
the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
securitizations the interest rate demanded by investors in the company s securitization transactions depends on prevailing market interest rates for comparable transactions and the general interest rate environment 
the company utilizes several strategies to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations on its gross interest rate margin  including the use of derivative financial instruments  the regular sale or pledging of auto receivables to securitization trusts and pre funding of securitization transactions 
in its securitization transactions  the company transfers fixed rate finance receivables to trusts that  in turn  sell either fixed rate or floating rate securities to investors 
the fixed rates on securities issued by the trusts are indexed to market interest rate swap spreads for transactions of similar duration or various london interbank offered rates libor and do not fluctuate during the term of the securitization 
the floating rates on securities issued by the trusts are indexed to libor and fluctuate periodically based on movements in libor 
derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swap and cap agreements  are used to manage the gross interest rate spread on these transactions 
the company uses interest rate swap agreements to convert the variable rate exposures on securities issued by its securitization trusts to a fixed rate  thereby locking in the gross interest rate spread to be earned by the company over the life of a securitization accounted for as a secured financing that would have been affected by changes in interest rates 
interest rate swap agreements purchased by the company do not impact the amount of cash flows to be received by holders of the asset backed securities issued by the trusts 
the interest rate swap agreements serve to offset the impact of increased or decreased interest paid by the trusts on floating rate asset backed securities on the cash flows to be received by the company from the trusts 
the company utilizes such arrangements to modify its net interest sensitivity to levels deemed appropriate based on the company s risk tolerance 
in circumstances where the interest rate risk is deemed to be tolerable  usually if the risk is less than one year in term at inception  the company may choose not to hedge potential fluctuations in cash flows due to changes in interest rates 
the company s special purpose finance subsidiaries are contractually required to provide additional credit enhancement on their floating rate securities even if the company chooses not to hedge its future cash flows 
to comply with this requirement  the special purpose finance subsidiary purchases an interest rate cap agreement 
although the interest rate cap agreements are purchased by the trusts  cash outflows from the trusts ultimately impact the company s retained interests in the securitization transactions as cash expended by the securitization trusts will decrease the ultimate amount of cash to be received by the company 
therefore  when economically feasible  the company may simultaneously sell a corresponding interest rate cap agreement to offset the premium paid by the trust to purchase the interest rate cap agreement 
the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements purchased by the special purpose finance subsidiaries in connection with securitization transactions structured as secured financings are included in other assets and the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements sold by the company are included in derivative financial instruments on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
changes in the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements sold by the company are reflected in interest expense on the company s consolidated statements of income 
pre funding securitizations is the practice of issuing more asset backed securities than needed to cover finance receivables initially sold or pledged to the trust 
the proceeds from the pre funded portion are held in an 
table of contents escrow account until additional receivables are delivered to the trust in amounts up to the pre funded balance held in the escrow account 
the use of pre funded securitizations allows the company to lock in borrowing costs with respect to the finance receivables subsequently delivered to the trust 
however  the company incurs an expense in pre funded securitizations during the period between the initial securitization and the subsequent delivery of finance receivables equal to the difference between the interest earned on the proceeds held in the escrow account and the interest rate paid on the asset backed securities outstanding

management monitors the company s hedging activities to ensure that the value of derivative financial instruments  their correlation to the contracts being hedged and the amounts being hedged continue to provide effective protection against interest rate risk
