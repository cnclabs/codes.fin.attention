item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview introduction we are an integrated telecommunications services provider offering a portfolio of international and domestic voice  wireless  internet  voice over internet protocol voip  data and hosting services to business and residential retail customers and other carriers located primarily in the united states  australia  canada  the united kingdom and europe 
our focus is to service the demand for high quality  competitively priced international communications services that is being driven by the globalization of the world s economies  the worldwide trend toward telecommunications deregulation and the growth of internet  voip  wireless and data traffic 
recent product initiatives overview we have selectively targeted opportunities for us to participate in major growth areas for telecommunications local  wireless and broadband 
our approach in these areas has common elements focus on bundling services to end user customers with international calling patterns  leverage our existing global voice  data and internet network  and utilize our established distribution channels and back office systems 
the year was highlighted by the accelerated implementation of our new strategic initiatives 
we believe the local services market is a major opportunity for revenue growth for us 
we recently began offering local line service and wireless services in canada on a resale basis 
we plan to bundle these services with our other product offerings of long distance and internet access  in competition with the incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs 
we are currently a local resale service provider in australia  bundling the product with long distance  dial up internet access and resale broadband digital subscriber line dsl services 
the ability to bundle local service for our existing customer base and attract new customers to our existing services presents future growth opportunities for us 
our wireless initiative will target as potential new customers all wireless users in our existing major markets europe  united states  canada  and australia who wish to make international calls using their wireless phones 
currently  many wireless users are blocked by their service provider from making international calls  and those that can make international calls are charged excessively high rates 
in europe  through a combination of reseller service initiatives  including dial around services  prepaid services  special pin personal identification number services  and primus branded intelligent handsets  we have targeted the users of wireless carriers and offer substantially reduced international rates 
even with reduced rates  we believe our services have the potential to generate substantial margins 
the wireless customer would not be required to change their underlying wireless service provider what we offer is a value added service that will provide a customer substantial cost savings on international calls  although we do also offer primus branded wireless services on a resale basis 
the current high rates for international calls from wireless phones have artificially suppressed this potentially large market  we intend to make international calling easy and affordable for wireless users 
the target customers for our broadband voip products will ultimately be anyone who has a broadband connection anywhere in the world 
we have been in the carrier voip market now for several years and carried over one billion minutes of international voice traffic in over the public internet 
starting in  we have introduced retail voip products in canada  and the united states 
in january  we launched our voip talkbroadband service in canada 
in june  we launched our lingo product in the united states  which offers unlimited calling plans including destinations in western europe and certain countries in asia  unlimited calling between two lingo subscribers and the issuance of phone numbers that are local for calls originating in certain foreign countries 
we anticipate that these three additional product lines local  wireless and broadband have the potential to drive future growth in our revenues 

table of contents recent competitive developments  acceleration of our integrated product response our operating results in the year reflect increased competition from product bundling in virtually all of our markets  together with continued competitive pricing pressures 
in addition  wireline long distance usage continued to decline due to increased use of wireless phones and internet services 
our revenue growth and profitability have been strongly challenged by a changing industry environment throughout this year 
during the first quarter of we experienced pricing pressure on our core long distance services and reduced margins on our resale of dsl in australia and significant churn in our dial up internet service provider isp products in australia 
in the second and third quarters  this competitive challenge became more intense when major incumbent carriers in many of our markets reduced pricing on long distance offerings to encourage customers to subscribe to their bundled local  wireless and broadband services 
our response to this new competitive reality has been to take immediate steps to accelerate our transformation from being a long distance voice and dial up isp carrier into an integrated wireline  wireless and broadband services provider 
this was a transformation we believe we had to make over time to remain competitive  and it was the basis for our new strategic initiatives in local  wireless  broadband and voip services 
although the aggregate revenues are still modest in comparison to this year s billion revenue base  revenues from these initiatives have increased significantly during the three months ended december  from the three months ended september  given these early results and the ongoing competitive pressures in the marketplace  we revised our prior plans for a measured roll out of our new products and services and have been accelerating the implementation of these initiatives throughout the second half of the year  including a dsl network build out in australia 
we believe these efforts will enhance our bundled service capabilities  and as a result  those efforts should reduce the competitive vulnerability of our core  high margin  retail long distance business 
they will also provide us with long term growth potential in local  wireless and broadband markets where we have previously not been a significant provider 
overview of historic global operations generally  we price our services competitively with the major carriers operating in our principal service regions 
we expect to continue to generate net revenue from internal growth through sales and marketing efforts focused on customers with significant communications needs international and domestic voice  wireless  voip  high speed and dial up internet and data  including small and medium sized enterprises smes  multinational corporations  residential customers  particularly ethnic customers  and other telecommunications carriers and resellers  as well as from acquisitions 
prices in the long distance industry have declined in recent years  and as competition continues to increase in each of the service segments and each of the product lines  we believe that prices are likely to continue to decrease 
long distance minutes of use per customer also continues to decline as more customers are using wireless phones and the internet as alternatives to the use of wireline phones 
additionally  we believe that because deregulatory influences have begun to affect telecommunications markets outside the united states  the deregulatory trend will result in greater competition from the existing wireline and wireless competitors and from new entrants  such as cable companies and voip companies  which could continue to adversely affect our net revenue per minute 
as the portion of traffic transmitted over leased or owned facilities increases  cost of revenue increasingly is comprised of fixed costs 
in order to manage such costs  we pursue a flexible approach with respect to the expansion of our network capacity 
in most instances  we initially obtain transmission capacity on a variable cost  per minute leased basis  then acquire additional capacity on a fixed cost basis when traffic volume makes such a commitment cost effective  and ultimately purchase and operate our own facilities when traffic levels justify such investment 
we also seek to lower the cost of revenue through optimizing the cost of traffic by using the least expensive cost routing  negotiating lower variable usage based costs with domestic and foreign service providers and negotiating additional and lower cost foreign carrier agreements with the foreign incumbent carriers and others  
table of contents continuing to expand the capacity of our network when traffic volumes justify such investment  and increasing use of the public internet 
in most countries  we generally realize a higher margin on our international long distance as compared to our domestic long distance services and a higher margin on our services to both business and residential customers compared to those realized on our services to other telecommunications carriers 
at the current time  we generally realize a higher margin on long distance services as compared to those realized on local switched and wireless services  many of which are resold 
we also generally realize a higher margin on our internet access  data services  and retail broadband and voip services as compared to voice services 
carrier services over a fixed line network  which generate a lower margin than retail business and residential services  are an important part of net revenue because the additional traffic volume of such carrier customers improves the utilization of the network and allows us to obtain greater volume discounts from our suppliers than we otherwise would realize 
also  carrier services over internet protocol ip have higher margins than carrier services over a fixed line network 
overall carrier revenue accounted for  and of total net revenue for the year ended december   and  respectively 
the provision of carrier services also allows us to connect our network to all major carriers  which enables us to provide global coverage 
our overall margin may fluctuate based on the relative volumes of international versus domestic long distance services  carrier services versus business and residential long distance services  internet  voip and data services versus voice services  the amount of services that are resold  and the proportion of traffic carried on our network versus resale of other carriers services 
increased pressure will occur on our margin from customer set up fees as we accelerate customer additions with our new product initiatives 
for example  we pay a charge to transfer a new local customer in canada  and in australia  charges to migrate dsl and local customers 
however  migrating customers to our own networks such as the dsl network being constructed in australia enables us to increase our margin on such services as compared to resale of services using other carriers networks 
selling  general and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of salaries and benefits  commissions  occupancy costs  sales and marketing expenses  advertising  professional fees  and administrative costs 
all selling  general and administrative expenses are expensed when incurred  with the exception of direct response advertising  which is expensed in accordance with statement of position  reporting on advertising costs 
to further deploy and to promote our new initiatives and to defend our existing core businesses against increased competitive threats  our sales and marketing expenses have been increased as a percentage of net revenue in the near term 
we do not anticipate meaningful revenue contributions from the new initiatives until the latter half of our debt reduction and refinancing efforts have resulted in a trend of decreasing interest expense since such efforts began in december we will continue to reduce debt through regularly scheduled principal payments and opportunistic purchases 
foreign currency can have a major impact on our financial results 
currently in excess of of our net revenue is derived from sales and operations outside the united states 
the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the united states dollar usd 
the local currency of each country is the functional currency for each of our respective entities operating in that country 
in the future  we expect to continue to derive the majority of our net revenue and incur a significant portion of our operating costs from outside the united states  and therefore changes in exchange rates have had and may continue to have a significant  and potentially adverse  effect on our results of operations 
our primary risk of loss regarding foreign currency exchange rate risk is caused primarily by fluctuations in the following exchange rates usd australian dollar aud  usd canadian dollar cad  usd great britain pound gbp  and usd euro dollar eur 
due to the large percentage of our revenue derived outside of the united states  strengthening of the usd relative to one or more of the foregoing currencies  could have an adverse impact on our future results of operations 
we have agreements with certain subsidiaries for repayment of a portion of the investments and advances made to these subsidiaries 
as we anticipate repayment in the foreseeable future  we recognize the unrealized gains and losses in foreign currency transaction gain loss on the consolidated statements of operations 
we historically 
table of contents have not engaged in hedging transactions 
however  the exposure of our income from operations to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is reduced in part because a majority of the costs that we incur in connection with our foreign operations are also denominated in local currencies 
we are exposed to financial statement gains and losses as a result of translating the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries 
we translate the local currency statements of operations of our foreign subsidiaries into usd using the average exchange rate during the reporting period 
changes in foreign exchange rates affect the reported profits and losses and cash flows and may distort comparisons from year to year 
by way of example  when the usd strengthens compared to the eur  there is a negative effect on the reported results for europe and takes more profits in eur to generate the same amount of profits in usd 
the opposite is also true 
that is  when the usd weakens there is a positive effect on reported results for europe 
in the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   the usd was weaker on average as compared to the cad  aud  gbp and eur

we acquired three canadian isps  one canadian local service provider and a canadian prepaid calling card company for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million in cash 
the purchase price for the prepaid calling card company may increase based on additional consideration to be paid  as provided by the terms of the acquisition agreement  if the acquired company s adjusted revenues exceed certain targeted levels 
critical accounting policies to aid in the understanding of our financial reporting  our most critical accounting policies are described below 
these policies have the potential to have a more significant impact on our financial statements  either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate  or because they require judgment and estimation due to the uncertainty involved in measuring  at a specific point in time  events which are continuous in nature 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue net revenue is derived from carrying a mix of business  residential and carrier long distance traffic  data and internet traffic  and also from the provision of local and wireless services 
for voice and wholesale voip  net revenue is earned based on the number of minutes during a call and is recorded upon completion of a call  adjusted for allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  service credits and service adjustments 
revenue for a period is calculated from information received through our network switches 
customized software has been designed to track the information from the switch and analyze the call detail records against stored detailed information about revenue rates 
this software provides us the ability to do a timely and accurate analysis of revenue earned in a period 
separate prepaid services software is used to track additional information related to prepaid service usage such as activation date  monthly usage amounts and expiration date 
revenue on these prepaid services is recognized as service is provided until expiration when all unused minutes  which are no longer available to the customers  are recognized as revenue 
net revenue is also earned for the provision of data internet services including retail voip 
data internet services include monthly fees collected for the provision of dedicated and dial up access at various speeds and bandwidths 
these fees are recognized as access is provided on a monthly basis 
additionally  service activation and installation fees are deferred and amortized over the longer of the average customer life or the contract term 
we record payments received in advance for prepaid services and services to be provided under contractual agreements  such as internet broadband and dial up access  as deferred revenue until such related services are provided 
a portion of revenue  representing less than of total revenue  is earned from the sale of wireless handsets and voip routers 
we apply the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which provides guidance on when and how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
we have concluded that eitf no 
requires us to account for the sale of wireless handsets and voip routers and the related cost of handset and router revenues as a separate unit of accounting when title to the handset or router passes to the customer 
revenue recognized is the portion of the activation fees allocated to the router unit of accounting in the statement of operations when title to the router passes to the customer 
we defer the portion of the activation fees allocated to the service unit of accounting  and recognize such deferred fees on a straight line basis over the contract life in the statement of operations 
net revenue represents gross revenue  net of allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  service credits and service adjustments 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts receivable determining our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable requires significant estimates 
due to the large number of customers that we serve  it is impractical to review the creditworthiness of each of our customers  although a credit review is performed for larger carrier and retail business customers 
we consider a number of factors in determining the proper level of the allowance  including historical collection experience  current economic trends  the aging of the accounts receivable portfolio and changes in the creditworthiness of our customers 
systems to detect fraudulent call activity are in place within our network  but if these systems fail to identify such activity  we may realize a higher degree of uncollectible accounts 
if the estimate of uncollectible revenue was higher than our current estimates  net revenue would have been reduced by approximately million  million and million for the year ended december   and  respectively 
cost of revenue cost of revenue is comprised primarily of costs incurred from other domestic and foreign telecommunications carriers to originate  transport and terminate calls 
the majority of our cost of revenue is variable  based upon the number of minutes of use  with transmission and termination costs being the most significant expense 
call activity is tracked and analyzed with customized software that analyzes the traffic flowing through our network switches and calculates the variable cost of revenue with predetermined contractual rates 
if the domestic or foreign telecommunications carriers have tracked and invoiced the volume of minutes at levels different than what our activity shows or have invoiced at different rates  we will dispute the charges invoiced 
there is no guarantee that we will prevail in the dispute 
we use significant estimates to determine the level of success in dispute resolution and consider past historical experience  basis of dispute  financial status and current relationship with vendor  and aging of prior disputes in quantifying our estimates 
valuation of long lived assets we review intangible and other long lived assets whenever events or changes indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in making such evaluations  we compare the expected future cash flows to the carrying amount of the assets 
if the total of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we are required to make estimates of the fair value of the long lived assets in order to calculate the impairment loss equal to the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the assets 
we make significant assumptions and estimates in this process regarding matters that are inherently uncertain  such as estimating cash flows  remaining useful lives  discount rates and growth rates 
the resulting cash flows are computed over an extended period of time  which subjects those assumptions and estimates to an even larger degree of uncertainty 
while we believe that our estimates are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect the valuation of the long lived assets 
accounting for income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of transactions and events 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement bases and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
if necessary  deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to an amount that is determined to be more likely than not recoverable 
we must make significant estimates and assumptions about future taxable income and future tax consequences when determining the amount of the valuation allowance 
in addition  tax contingency reserves if any are established or released based on assumptions about the expected outcomes of current or anticipated tax examinations  refund claims and or tax related litigation and estimates regarding additional tax liability including interest and penalties thereon or refunds resulting therefrom 
at present  our subsidiaries in the major jurisdictions in which we operate have significant deferred tax assets resulting from tax loss carryforwards 
with the exception of our canadian companies  these deferred tax assets are fully offset with valuation allowances 
the appropriateness and amount of these valuation allowances are based on our assumptions about the future taxable income of each affiliate 
except in the case of our canadian companies  if our assumptions have significantly underestimated future taxable income with respect to a particular affiliate  all or part of the valuation allowance for the affiliate would be reversed and additional income may result 
with the exception of our canadian affiliates  if our assumptions have significantly overestimated future taxable income with respect to a particular affiliate  there would be no change in the net 
table of contents value of the deferred tax asset and no additional income or tax expense would result 
if our assumptions with respect to our canadian affiliates have significantly overestimated future taxable income  a full or partial valuation allowance would be applied to the corresponding deferred tax assets and additional tax expense would result

however  there are substantial risks  uncertainties and changes that could cause actual results to differ from our current belief  particularly as aggressive pricing and bundling strategies by certain ilecs have intensified competitive pressures in the markets where we operate

table of contents substantial indebtedness  liquidity 
we currently have substantial indebtedness and anticipate that we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future 
the level and or terms of our indebtedness could make it difficult for us to make required payments of principal and interest on our outstanding debt  including the notes  could limit our ability to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes  requires that a substantial portion of our cash flow  if any  be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on outstanding indebtedness and other obligations and  accordingly  such cash flow will not be available for use in our business  could limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business  results in our being more highly leveraged than many of our competitors  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage  and will make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business 
limited experience in delivering new product initiatives and in providing bundled local  wireless  broadband  dsl  internet  data and voip services 
during  we accelerated initiatives to provide wireless  broadband  voip and local wireline services in certain markets where we operate 
during the third quarter of we accelerated initiatives to become an integrated wireline  wireless and broadband service provider in order to counter competitive pricing pressures initiated by large incumbent providers in certain of the principal markets where we operate and to stem the loss of certain of our wireline and isp customers to our competitors bundled wireless  wireline and broadband service offerings 
our experience in providing these new products in certain markets and in providing these bundled service offerings is limited 
our primary competitors include incumbent telecommunications providers  cable companies and other isps that have a significant national or international presence 
many of these operators have substantially greater resources  capital and operational experience than we do 
we also expect that we will experience increased competition from traditional telecommunications carriers and cable companies and other new entrants that expand into the market for broadband  voip  internet services and traditional voice services 
therefore  future operations involving these individual or bundled services may not succeed in this new competitive environment  we may not be able to expand successfully and we may experience margin pressure 
as a result  there can be no assurance that we will maintain or increase revenues or that we will be able to generate income from operations or net income in the future or on any predictable basis 
pricing and bundling pressure 
the long distance telecommunications  internet  broadband  dsl  data and wireless industry is significantly influenced by the marketing and pricing decisions of the larger long distance industry  internet access  broadband  dsl and wireless business participants 
prices in the long distance industry have continued to decline in recent years  and as competition continues to increase within each of our service segments and each of our product lines  we believe that prices are likely to continue to decrease 
our competitors in our core markets include  among others at t  mci  sprint  the rbocs and the major wireless carriers in the united states  telstra  singtel optus and telecom new zealand in australia  telus  bce  callnet  allstream formerly at t canada and the major wireless companies in canada  and bt  cable wireless united kingdom  mci  colt telecom  energis and the major wireless carriers in the united kingdom 
customers frequently change long distance providers and isps in response to the offering of lower rates or promotional incentives  increasingly as a result of bundling of various services by competitors 
moreover  competitors voip and broadband product rollouts have added further customer choice and pricing pressure 
as a result  generally  customers can switch carriers and service offerings at any time 
competition in all of our markets is likely to remain intense  or even increase in intensity and  as deregulatory influences are experienced in markets outside the united states  competition in non united states markets is becoming similar to the intense competition in the united states 
many of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources  larger networks  a broader portfolio of service offerings  greater control over transmission lines  stronger name recognition and customer loyalty  long standing relationships with our target customers  and lower debt leverage ratios 
as a result  our ability to attract and retain customers may be adversely affected 
many of our competitors enjoy economies of scale that result in low cost structures for transmission and related costs that could cause significant pricing pressures within the industry 
several long distance carriers in the united states  canada and australia and the major wireless carriers and cable companies  have introduced pricing and product bundling strategies that provide for fixed  low rates for calls 
this strategy 
table of contents could have a material adverse effect on our net revenue per minute  results of operations and financial condition if increases in telecommunications usage and potential cost declines do not result from  or are insufficient to offset the effects of  such price decreases 
many companies emerging out of bankruptcy might benefit from a lower cost structure and might apply pricing pressure within the industry to gain market share 
we compete on the basis of price  particularly with respect to our sales to other carriers  and also on the basis of customer service and our ability to provide a variety of telecommunications products and services 
if such price pressures and bundling strategies intensify  we may not be able to compete successfully in the future 
managing growth 
our continued growth and expansion may place a significant strain on our management  operational and financial resources  and increase demand on our systems and controls 
to manage our growth effectively  we must continue to implement and improve our operational and financial systems and controls  purchase and utilize other transmission facilities  and expand  train and manage our employee base 
if we inaccurately forecast the movement of traffic onto our network  we could have insufficient or excessive transmission facilities and disproportionate fixed expenses 
as we proceed with our development  operational difficulties could arise from additional demand placed on customer provisioning and support  billing and management information systems  product delivery and fulfillment  on our support  sales and marketing and administrative resources and on our network infrastructure 
for instance  we may encounter delays or cost overruns or suffer other adverse consequences in implementing new systems when required 
in addition  our operating and financial control systems and infrastructure could be inadequate to ensure timely and accurate financial reporting 
historical and future operating losses and net losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
the company incurred net losses of million in  million in  million in  million in  million in and million in during the year ended december   we recognized net income of million  of which million is the positive impact of foreign currency transaction gains 
our net income and net revenue growth should not necessarily be considered to be indicative of future net income and net revenue growth 
we cannot assure you that we will recognize net income  or net revenue will grow or be sustained in future periods 
if we cannot generate net income or operating profitability  we may not be able to meet our debt service or working capital requirements 
integration of acquired businesses 
we strive to increase the volume of voice and data traffic that we carry over our existing global network in order to reduce transmission costs and other operating costs as a percentage of net revenue  improve margins  improve service quality and enhance our ability to introduce new products and services 
future acquisitions may be pursued to further our strategic objectives  including those described above 
acquisitions of businesses and customer lists  a key element of our historical growth strategy  involve operational risks  including the possibility that an acquisition does not ultimately provide the benefits originally anticipated by management 
moreover  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying attractive acquisition candidates  completing and financing additional acquisitions on favorable terms  or integrating the acquired business or assets into our own 
there may be difficulty in migrating the customer base and in integrating the service offerings  distribution channels and networks gained through acquisitions with our own 
successful integration of operations and technologies requires the dedication of management and other personnel  which may distract their attention from the day to day business  the development or acquisition of new technologies  and the pursuit of other business acquisition opportunities  and there can be no assurance that successful integration will occur in light of these factors 
intense competition in telecommunications 
the local and long distance telecommunications  data  broadband  internet  voip and wireless industry is intensely competitive with relatively limited barriers to entry in the more deregulated countries we operate and with numerous entities competing for the same customers 
recent and pending deregulation in various countries may encourage new entrants to compete  including isps  wireless companies  cable television companies  who would offer voice  broadband  internet access and television  and electric power utilities who would offer voice and broadband internet access 
for example  the 
table of contents united states and many other countries have committed to open their telecommunications markets to competition pursuant to an agreement under the world trade organization which began on january  further  in the united states  as certain conditions have been met under the telecommunications act of  the regional bell operating companies rbocs have been allowed to enter the long distance market  at t  mci and other long distance carriers have been allowed to enter the local telephone services market although recent judicial and regulatory developments have diminished the attractiveness of this opportunity  and many entities  including cable television companies and utilities  have been allowed to enter both the local service and long distance telecommunications markets 
moreover  the rapid enhancement of voip technology may result in increasing levels of traditional domestic and international voice long distance traffic being transmitted over the internet  as opposed to traditional telecommunication networks such as ours 
currently  there are significant capital investment savings and cost savings associated with carrying voice traffic employing voip technology  as compared to carrying calls over traditional networks 
thus  there exists the possibility that the price of traditional long distance voice services will decrease in order to be competitive with voip 
additionally  competition is expected to be intense to switch customers to voip product offerings  as is evidenced by numerous recent market announcements in the united states and internationally from industry leaders and competitive carriers concerning significant voip initiatives 
our ability effectively to retain our existing customer base and generate new customers  either through our network or our own voip offerings  may be adversely affected by accelerated competition arising as a result of voip initiatives 
as competition intensifies as a result of deregulatory  market or technological developments  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
dependence on transmission facilities based carriers 
we primarily connect our customers telephone calls through transmission lines that we lease under a variety of arrangements with other facilities based long distance carriers 
many of these carriers are  or may become  our competitors 
our ability to maintain and expand our business depends on our ability to maintain favorable relationships with the facilities based carriers from which we lease transmission lines 
if our relationship with one or more of these carriers were to deteriorate or terminate  it could have a material adverse effect upon our cost structure  service quality  network diversity  results of operations and financial condition 
international operations 
we have significant international operations and  as of december   derive more than of our revenues by providing services outside of the united states 
in international markets  we are smaller than the principal or incumbent telecommunications carrier that operates in each of the foreign jurisdictions where we operate 
in these markets  incumbent carriers are likely to control access to  and pricing of  the local networks  enjoy better brand recognition and brand and customer loyalty  generally offer a wider range of product and services  and have significant operational economies of scale  including a larger backbone network and more correspondent agreements 
moreover  the incumbent carrier may take many months to allow competitors  including us  to interconnect to its switches within its territory 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the permits and operating licenses required for us to operate  obtain access to local transmission facilities on economically acceptable terms  or market services in international markets 
in addition  operating in international markets generally involves additional risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  taxes  tariffs  customs  duties and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  problems in collecting accounts receivable  political risks  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  restrictions associated with the repatriation of funds  technology export and import restrictions  and seasonal reductions in business activity 
our ability to operate and grow our international operations successfully could be adversely impacted by these risks and uncertainties particularly in light of the fact that we derive such a large percentage of our revenues from outside of the united states 
foreign exchange risks 
a significant portion of our net revenue is derived from sales and operations outside the united states 
the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the usd 
the local currency of each country is the functional currency for each of our respective entities operating in that country 
in the future  we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our net revenue and incur a significant portion of our operating costs outside the united states  and changes in exchange rates have had and may have a significant  and potentially adverse  effect on our results of operations 
our primary risk of loss regarding foreign 
table of contents currency exchange rate risk is caused by fluctuations in the following exchange rates usd aud  usd cad  usd gbp  and usd eur 
for the year ended december   our results were favorably impacted by a weakening of the usd compared to the foregoing currencies 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
due to the large percentage of our operations conducted outside of the united states  strengthening of the usd relative to one or more of the foregoing currencies could have an adverse impact on future results of operations 
we historically have not engaged in hedging transactions and do not currently contemplate engaging in hedging transactions to mitigate foreign exchange risks 
in addition  the operations of affiliates and subsidiaries in foreign countries have been funded with investments and other advances denominated in foreign currencies 
historically  such investments and advances have been long term in nature  and we accounted for any adjustments resulting from currency translation as a charge or credit to accumulated other comprehensive income loss within the stockholders deficit section of our consolidated balance sheets 
in  agreements with certain subsidiaries were put in place for repayment of a portion of the investments and advances made to the subsidiaries 
as we anticipate repayment in the foreseeable future of these amounts  we recognize the unrealized gains and losses in foreign currency transaction gain loss on the consolidated statements of operations  and depending upon changes in future currency rates  such gains or losses could have a significant  and potentially adverse  effect on our results of operations 
industry changes 
the telecommunications industry is changing rapidly due to deregulation  privatization  consolidation  technological improvements  availability of alternative services such as wireless  broadband  dsl  internet  voip  and wireless dsl through use of the fixed wireless spectrum  and the globalization of the world s economies 
in addition  alternative services to traditional fixed wireline services  such as wireless  broadband  internet and voip services  are a substantial competitive threat 
if we do not adjust our contemplated plan of development to meet changing market conditions and if we do not have adequate resources  we may not be able to compete effectively 
the telecommunications industry is marked by the introduction of new product and service offerings and technological improvements 
achieving successful financial results will depend on our ability to anticipate  assess and adapt to rapid technological changes  and offer  on a timely and cost effective basis  services including the bundling of multiple services  that meet evolving industry standards 
if we do not anticipate  assess or adapt to such technological changes at a competitive price  maintain competitive services or obtain new technologies on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms  our financial results may be materially and adversely affected 
network development  migration of traffic 
our long term success depends on our ability to design  implement  operate  manage and maintain a reliable and cost effective network 
in addition  we rely on third parties to enable us to expand and manage our global network and to provide local  broadband internet and wireless services 
if we fail to generate additional traffic on our network  if we experience technical or logistical impediments to our ability to develop necessary network such as our dsl network in australia or to migrate traffic onto our network  or if we experience difficulties with our third party providers  we may not achieve desired economies of scale or otherwise be successful in growing our business 
intellectual property and proprietary rights 
our ability to compete depends  in part  on our ability to use intellectual property in the united states and internationally 
we rely on a combination of trade secrets  trademarks and licenses to protect our intellectually property 
we are also subject to the risks of claims and litigation alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 
the telecommunications industry is subject to frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
we rely upon certain technology  including hardware and software  licensed from third parties 
there can be no assurance that the technology licensed by us will continue to provide competitive features and functionality or that licenses for technology currently used by us or other technology that we may seek to license in the future will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the loss of  or inability to maintain existing licenses could result in shipment delays or reductions until equivalent technology or suitable alternative products could be developed  identified  licensed and integrated  and could harm our business 
these licenses are on standard commercial terms made generally available by the companies providing the licenses 
the cost and terms of these licenses individually are not material to our business 

table of contents dependence on key personnel 
the loss of the services of k 
paul singh  our chairman and chief executive officer  or the services of our other key personnel  or our inability to attract and retain additional key management  technical and sales personnel  could have a material adverse effect upon us 
government regulation 
our operations are subject to constantly changing regulation 
there can be no assurance that future regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on us  or that regulators or third parties will not raise material issues with regard to our compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations  any of which could have a material adverse effect upon us 
as a multinational telecommunications company  we are subject to varying degrees of regulation in each of the jurisdictions in which we provide our services 
local laws and regulations  and the interpretation of such laws and regulations  differ significantly among the jurisdictions in which we operate 
enforcement and interpretations of these laws and regulations can be unpredictable and are often subject to the informal views of government officials 
recent widespread regulatory changes in the united kingdom and potential future regulatory  judicial  legislative and government policy changes in other jurisdictions where we operate could have a material adverse effect on us 
recent judicial decisions in the united kingdom involving the imposition of vat on prepaid calling card products could result in a fundamental restructuring of our european prepaid card business and could adversely affect revenues and margin 
domestic or international regulators or third parties may raise material issues with regard to our compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations  and therefore may have a material adverse impact on our competitive position  growth and financial performance 
regulatory considerations that affect or limit our business include united states common carrier requirements not to discriminate unreasonably among customers and to charge just and reasonable rates  general uncertainty regarding the future regulatory classification of and taxation of voip telephony  if regulators decide that voip is a regulated telecommunications service  our voip services may be subject to burdensome regulatory requirements and fees  we may be obligated to pay carriers additional interconnection fees and operating costs may increase  general changes in access charges  universal service and regulatory fee payments would affect our cost of providing long distance services  and general changes in access charges and contribution payments could adversely affect our cost of providing long distance  wireless  broadband  voip  local and other services 
any adverse developments implicating the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  result of operations and prospects 
natural disasters 
many of the geographic areas where we conduct our business may be affected by natural disasters  including hurricanes and tropical storms 
hurricanes  tropical storms and other natural disasters could have a material adverse effect on the business by damaging the network facilities or curtailing voice or data traffic as a result of the effects of such events  such as destruction of homes and businesses 
terrorist attacks 
we are a united states based corporation with significant international operations 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred in new york city and washington  dc on september   and subsequent worldwide terrorist actions  including apparent action against companies operating abroad  may negatively affect our operations 
we cannot assure you that there will not be further terrorist attacks that impact our employees  network facilities or support systems  either in the united states or in any of the other countries in which we operate 
certain losses resulting from these types of events are uninsurable and others are not likely to be covered by our insurance 
terrorist attacks may directly impact our business operations through damage or harm to our employees  network facilities or support systems  increased security costs or the general curtailment of voice or data traffic 
any of these events could result in increased volatility in or damage to our business and the united states and worldwide financial markets and economies 
risk related to significant sales of our common stock 
significant future sales of our common stock in the public market  including in particular the shares offered under the common stock resale registration defined below and the note registration statement defined below  could lower our stock price and impair our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings 
there are  shares of common stock that were issued upon conversion of our series c preferred stock in november that are registered for resale under an effective registration statement the common stock registration under the securities act 

table of contents these shares  in general  may be freely resold under the securities act pursuant to the common stock registration 
in addition  the holders of the convertible notes have a registration statement that has been declared effective under the securities act covering these notes and common stock issuable upon conversion of these notes the note registration statement 
sales of a substantial amount of common stock in the public market pursuant to the registration statements described above or rule under the securities act  or the perception that these sales may occur  could create selling pressure on our common stock and adversely affect the market price of our common stock prevailing from time to time in the public market and could impair our ability to raise funds in additional stock offerings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposures relate to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and to changes in interest rates 
foreign currency a significant portion of our net revenue is derived from sales and operations outside the united states 
the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the usd 
the local currency of each country is the functional currency for each respective entity 
in the future we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our net revenue and incur a significant portion of our operating costs outside the united states  and changes in exchange rates have had and may continue to have a significant  and potentially adverse effect on our results of operations 
our primary risk of loss regarding foreign currency exchange rate risk is caused primarily by fluctuations in the following exchange rates usd aud  usd cad  usd gbp  and usd eur 
due to the large percentage of our revenues derived outside of the united states  strengthening of the usd relative to one or more of the foregoing currencies  could have an adverse impact on our future results of operations 
in addition  the operations of affiliates and subsidiaries in foreign countries have been funded with investments and other advances 
prior to  such investments and advances have been long term in nature  and we accounted for any adjustments resulting from translation as a charge or credit to accumulated other comprehensive income loss within the stockholders deficit section of the consolidated balance sheets 
in  agreements with certain subsidiaries were put in place for repayment of a portion of the investments and advances made to the subsidiaries 
as we are anticipating repayment in the foreseeable future of these amounts  we recognize the unrealized gains and losses in foreign currency transaction gain loss on the consolidated statements of operations 
we are exposed to financial statement gains and losses as a result of translating the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries 
we translate the local currency statements of operations of our foreign subsidiaries into usd using the average exchange rate during the reporting period 
changes in foreign exchange rates affect our reported profits and losses and cash flows and may distort comparisons from year to year 
by way of example  when the usd strengthens compared to the eur  there is a negative effect on our reported results for europe 
it takes more profits in eur to generate the same amount of profits in stronger usd 
the opposite is also true 
that is  when the usd weakens there is a positive effect on our reported results for europe 
in the year ended december   the usd weakened compared to the aud  cad  gbp and eur 
as a result  our revenue of the subsidiaries whose local currency is aud  cad  gbp and eur increased   and in local currency compared to the year ended december   but increased   and in usd  respectively 
interest rates all of our long term debt obligations are at fixed interest rates at december  we are exposed to interest rate risk as additional financing may be required 
our primary exposure to market risk stems from fluctuations in interest rates 
we do not currently anticipate entering into interest rate swaps and or similar instruments 
on february   we obtained a million senior secured loan facility  which has a variable interest rate feature 

table of contents the interest rate sensitivity table below summarizes our market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates as of december  in usd  which is our reporting currency 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by year of expected maturity for our senior notes  convertible senior notes  convertible subordinated debentures  leased fiber capacity  and other long term obligations in effect at december  in the case of the convertible senior notes and convertible subordinated debentures the table excludes the potential exercise of the relevant redemption and conversion features
