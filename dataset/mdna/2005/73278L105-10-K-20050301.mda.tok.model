item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
customers and products we serve roughly  customers  none of which account for more than of our sales 
we primarily serve three types of customers swimming pool remodelers and builders  retail swimming pool stores  and swimming pool repair and service companies 
these customers are mostly small  family owned businesses with relatively limited capital resources 
we maintain a strict credit policy 
in the past  losses from customer receivables have been within our expectations 
we conduct our operations through service centers in north america and europe 
our primary markets  which have the highest concentration of swimming pools  are california  florida  texas and arizona  representing approximately of our net sales in we use a combination of national and local sales and marketing personnel to promote the growth of our business and develop and strengthen our customers businesses 
our national personnel focus on developing customer programs and promotional activities  creating and enhacing sales management tools and providing product and market expertise 
our local sales personnel work from the service centers and are charged with understanding and meeting our customers specific needs 
we offer our customers more than  national brand and private label products 
we believe that our selection of pool equipment and supplies  chemicals  replacement parts and complementary products is the most comprehensive in the swimming pool industry 
the products we sell can be categorized as follows maintenance products such as chemicals  supplies and pool accessories  repair and replacement parts for cleaners  filters  heaters  pumps and lights  packaged pool kits including walls  liners  bracing  filters  heaters  pumps and lights for in ground and above ground pools  pool equipment and materials for new pool construction and the remodeling of existing pools  discretionary products that enhance consumers use and enjoyment of their pool including water features  fountains  decorative tile  toys and games  and other recreational and backyard related products sold by our customers including hot tubs  patio furniture  grills and artificial christmas trees 
scp pool corporation part i 
item business continued maintenance products and repair and replacement parts are non discretionary in nature  meaning that these items must be purchased by pool owners to maintain existing swimming pools 
over of our gross profits are derived from the sale of products used to maintain and repair the installed base of pools and less than are derived from the construction equipment  building materials  plumbing  electrical of new in ground and above ground pools 
in  in an effort to provide more of a one stop shopping experience for our customers  we began to offer products which our customers traditionally purchased from other suppliers 
these products  which we refer to as complementary products  include building materials  plumbing and electrical supplies  toys and games  hot tubs and hot tub accessories  and other products traditionally not sold by most swimming pool distributors 
we have identified other product categories that could become part of our complementary product offerings in the future 
we typically choose two to three categories each year and introduce them in certain markets 
we then evaluate the performance of these test categories and focus on those which we believe exhibit long term growth potential 
pool s complementary products sales have grown from million in to over million in this growth has been an important factor in our base business sales growth over the past six years 
complementary product sales grew in and accounted for nearly of our total net sales at comparable margins to our traditional product offerings 
in  we intend to continue to expand our complementary products initiative by increasing the number of locations which offer complementary products  increasing the number of complementary products offered at certain locations and also through a modest broadening of the product offerings on a company wide basis 
we expect complementary product sales to approach of our total sales in operating strategy we operate two distribution networks in north america the scp distributors network scp and the superior pool products superior network 
the scp network consists of service centers  including locations in europe  and the superior network consists of locations 
we adopted this strategy of operating two distinct distribution networks primarily for two reasons to offer our customers a choice of different distributors  featuring distinctive product selections and relationships with manufacturers  and to increase the level of customer service and operational efficiency provided by the service centers in each network by promoting healthy competition between the two networks 
scp pool corporation part i 
item business continued our service centers are evaluated based upon their performance relative to predetermined standards that include both financial and operational measures 
our corporate support groups provide our field operations with services including customer and vendor related programs  systems and expert resources to use to help achieve their goals 
we employ incentive programs and feedback mechanisms along with the competitive nature of our internal networks to stimulate performance 
employees we employed approximately  people at february  given the seasonal nature of our business  our peak employment period is the summer  when we add up to more employees to our work force to meet seasonal demand 
distribution our service centers are located near customer concentrations  typically in industrial  commercial or mixed use zones 
customers may pick up products at any service center location  or products may be delivered via our trucks or third party carriers 
our service centers maintain well stocked inventories to meet customers immediate needs 
we utilize warehouse management technology to optimize receiving  inventory control  picking  packing and shipping functions 
in addition  we operate five centralized shipping locations and two construction materials centers that redistribute products we purchase in bulk quantities to our service centers or directly to customers 
purchasing and suppliers we enjoy good relationships with our suppliers  who generally offer competitive pricing  return policies and promotional allowances 
it is customary in the swimming pool supply industry for manufacturers to seasonally offer extended payment terms to qualifying purchasers such as pool 
these terms are typically available to us for pre season or early season purchases 
we initiated a preferred vendor program in which encourages our buyers to purchase products from a smaller number of vendors 
we work closely with these vendors to develop programs and services to better meet the needs of our customers and concentrate our purchasing activities 
these practices  together with a more comprehensive service offering  have resulted in improved margins at the service center level 
we regularly evaluate supplier relationships and consider alternate sourcing to assure competitive cost  service and quality standards 
our largest suppliers include pentair corporation  hayward pool products  inc and waterpik technologies  inc  which accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the cost of products we sold in competition based on industry knowledge and available data  management believes pool is the largest wholesale distributor in the swimming pool supply industry  and the only truly national wholesale distributor focused on the pool industry in the united states 
we face intense competition from many regional and local distributors in our markets and to a scp pool corporation part i 
item business continued lesser extent  mass market retailers and large pool supply retailers with their own internal distribution networks 
some geographic markets we serve  particularly our largest  higher density markets in california  florida  texas and arizona  are more competitive than others 
barriers to entry in the swimming pool supply industry are relatively low 
we compete with other distributors for rights to distribute brand name products 
if we lose or are unable to obtain these rights  we might be materially and adversely affected 
we believe that the size of our operations allows us to compete favorably for such distribution rights 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in swimming pool supply distribution are the breadth and availability of products offered  the quality and level of customer service  the breadth and depth of sales and marketing programs  consistency and stability of business relationships with customers  and competitive product pricing 
we believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to each of these factors 
seasonality and weather see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 
environmental  health and safety regulations our business is subject to regulation under local fire codes and federal  state and local environmental and health and safety requirements including the emergency planning and community right to know act and other environmental protection agency regulations  the hazardous materials transportation act and other department of transportation regulations  and the occupational safety and health act osha 
most of these requirements govern the packaging  labeling  handling  transportation  storage and sale of pool chemicals 
we store chemicals at each of our service centers 
the storage of these chemicals is strictly regulated by local fire codes 
in addition  we sell algaecides that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide  fungicide and rodenticide act and state pesticide laws 
these laws primarily relate to labeling and annual registration 
intellectual property we maintain both domestic and foreign registered trademarks primarily for our private label products and we intend to maintain the trademark registrations important to our business operations 
we also own rights to several internet domain names 
scp pool corporation part i 
item properties we lease the pool corporate and scp distributors llc administrative offices which consist of approximately  square feet of office space in covington  louisiana 
we own three service centers in florida 
all of our other properties are leased for terms that expire between and in addition to minimum rental payments  which are set at competitive rates  certain leases require reimbursement for taxes  maintenance and insurance 
most of our leases contain renewal options  some of which involve rent increases 
our service centers range in size from approximately  square feet to  square feet and generally consist of warehouse  counter  display and office space 
our centralized shipping locations range in size from  square feet to  square feet 
we believe that our facilities are well maintained  suitable for our business and occupy sufficient space to meet our operating needs 
as part of our normal business  we regularly evaluate service center performance and site suitability and may relocate a service center or consolidate two locations if a service center is redundant in a market  under performing or otherwise deemed unsuitable 
we do not believe that any single lease is material to our operations

item legal proceedings from time to time  we are subject to various claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business  including product liability  personal injury  commercial  contract and employment matters 
with respect to product related matters  we believe that if any such product related cases are determined in favor of a claimant  the manufacturers of such products would have primary responsibility for any damages because we are a distributor of finished goods manufactured by third parties  although no assurance can be given 
while the outcome of any litigation is inherently unpredictable  we do not believe  based on currently available facts  that the ultimate disposition of any of these matters will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

item selected financial data the table below sets forth selected financial data from the consolidated financial statements 
you should read this information in conjunction with item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes

for further discussion  see item the approximate decrease in working capital from to is due to long term debt related to our revolving line of credit  which expired in november and was classified as current at december  and also to an accounts receivable securitization facility we entered into in which is also classified as current 
the revolving line of credit was renegotiated in november for a five year period and borrowings under this facility are classified as long term debt at december  we calculate base business sales growth by excluding the following service centers from the calculation for months i service centers acquired within the past months  ii service centers consolidated with acquired locations and iii new service centers opened in new markets within the past months 
base business sales growth was not calculated prior to scp pool corporation part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our financial results reflect the continuing execution of our strategies to grow our customers businesses faster than the overall market  including the introduction of new products to our existing customer base  and to incrementally improve all aspects of our business operations 
net sales grew to billion in compared to billion in this is slightly lower than the sales growth experienced in and in as one of our vehicles for sales growth  acquisitions  was lower than historical levels  a trend we expect to continue 
growth in our base business has been relatively stable over this time period at  and for  and  respectively 
we attribute much of this growth to the success of the programs we offer to our customers  which are aimed at growing their businesses 
this contrasts with the growth of the overall market for swimming pool equipment and supplies  which we estimate grew from to per year over this same time period 
weather is the single biggest external factor impacting our business  and we believe our operating results in were impacted by the less than favorable weather conditions throughout much of the united states 
although we experienced favorable weather conditions in the western portion of the united states  much of the central and northeastern regions experienced unusually cold and wet conditions in the peak summer season  which adversely impacted our business 
the impact of weather on the pool markets we serve drives the seasonal nature of our business 
our peak selling season is the second quarter  followed by the third quarter  with the first and fourth quarters being the weakest 
our working capital needs tend to precede the seasonal impact by two to three months 
our results reflect the continued drive into newer product areas  as sales of complementary products have grown from million since to over million in in  complementary product sales grew over and accounted for of our total net sales 
these products  which our customers historically purchased from other suppliers  carry gross margins comparable to our traditional product categories 
additionally  we have recognized some incremental benefits through the utilization of our existing distribution infrastructure 
our service centers have augmented their product offerings with complementary products at various rates based upon an assortment of factors including regional market conditions 
we supplement our complementary product offerings each year to some degree by adding new products that we believe will be of interest to our customers and discontinuing products that are less promising 
overall  we expect complementary product sales to continue to grow at a rate much faster than the growth rate of our traditional product offerings  approaching of net sales in our net income increased to million in due primarily to the growth in sales and to other ongoing improvements in our operations  such as product sourcing  procurement and logistics initiatives  adoption of enhanced business practices and improved working capital management 
we expect to make continued operational improvements in the future 
during  as more fully described in the liquidity and capital resources section below  we executed a new five year credit facility that  along with our accounts receivables securitization facility  is our primary source of funds to meet our capital needs 
in the second quarter of  we initiated a dividend payment to our shareholders  which we continued in the third quarter and increased in the fourth quarter 
the initiation of this dividend reflects our belief that over the long term  we will generate sufficient cash flow and have adequate access to capital to both fund our business objectives and provide a direct return to our shareholders in the form of a dividend payment 
scp pool corporation part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in december  we exchanged the assets of our manufacturing facilities in fort wayne  indiana and quebec  canada for three distribution sites in ontario  canada and a minority equity interest in latham acquisition corporation  as more fully described herein 
we believe this transaction will allow us to focus more on our core distribution business while also providing us with a strategic relationship with an important supplier 
our business is subject to significant risks  including weather  competition  general economic conditions and other risks detailed below in our cautionary statement for purpose of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the accurate portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
in order to prepare financial statements that conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
certain estimates are particularly sensitive due to their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may be significantly different from our expectations 
we have identified the following six accounting policies that require us to make the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in order to fairly present our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for an estimate of the losses we will incur if our customers do not make required payments 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and typically do not require collateral 
consistent with industry practices  we require payment from our customers within days except for sales under early buy programs for which we provide extended payment terms to qualified customers 
the extended terms require payments in equal installments in april  may and june or may and june  depending on geographical location 
in the past  credit losses have been within or better than our expectations 
as our business is seasonal  our customers businesses are also seasonal 
sales are lowest in the winter months  and our past due accounts receivable balance as a percentage of total receivables generally increases during this time 
we provide reserves for uncollectible accounts based on the accounts receivable aging ranging from for amounts currently due up to for specific accounts more than days past due 
scp pool corporation part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued at the end of each year  we perform a reserve analysis of all accounts with past due balances greater than  additionally  we perform a separate reserve analysis on the balance of our accounts receivables with emphasis on the remainder of the past due portion of the aging 
as we review these past due accounts  we evaluate collectibility based on a combination of factors  including aging statistics and trends  customer payment history  independent credit reports  and discussions with customers 
during the year  we write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote 
such write offs are charged against our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the past five years  write offs have averaged less than of net sales 
if the balance of the accounts receivable reserve increased or decreased by at december   pretax income would change by approximately million and earnings per share would change by less than per diluted share based on the number of diluted shares outstanding at december  inventory obsolescence and shrink product inventories represent the largest asset on our balance sheet 
our goal is to manage our inventory such that we minimize stock outs to provide the highest level of service to our customers 
to do this  we maintain at each service center an adequate inventory of stock keeping units skus with the highest sales volume 
at the same time  we continuously strive to better manage our slower moving classes of inventory  which are not as critical to our customers and thus  inherently have lower velocity 
service centers classify products into classes based on sales at that location over the past months 
the table below presents a description of these inventory classes classes fastest moving items  which represent approximately of net sales at the service center classes slower moving items  which we keep in stock to provide a high level of customer service class products with no sales at a particular service center for the past twelve months or special order products not yet delivered to the customer there is little risk of obsolescence for products in classes because products in these classes turn quickly 
we establish our reserve for inventory obsolescence based on inventory classes  which we believe represent some exposure to inventory obsolescence  with particular emphasis on skus with the least sales over the previous months 
the reserve is intended to reflect the value of inventory that we may not be able to sell at a profit 
we provide a reserve of for inventory in classes we also provide an additional reserve for excess inventory in classes and an additional for class inventory 
we define excess inventory as the amount of inventory on hand in excess of the previous months usage on a company wide basis 
scp pool corporation part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in evaluating the adequacy of our reserve for inventory obsolescence and shrink at the service center level  we consider a combination of factors including the level of inventory in relationship to historical sales by product  including inventory usage by class based on product sales at both the service center and company levels  changes in customer preferences  the experience of the service center manager  the previous inventory management performance of the service center  geographical location  and new product offerings 
our reserve for inventory obsolescence may periodically require adjustment as changes occur in the above identified factors 
if the balance of our inventory reserve increased or decreased by at december   pretax income would change by approximately million and earnings per share would change by less than per diluted share based on the number of diluted shares outstanding at december  revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  and the appropriate amendments 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before we can recognize revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record revenue when customers take delivery of products 
customers may pick up products at any service center location  or products may be delivered via our trucks or third party carriers 
products shipped via third party carriers are considered delivered based on the shipping terms  which are generally fob shipping point 
we may offer volume rebates  which we accrue monthly as an adjustment to net sales 
we record customer returns  including those associated with early buy programs  as an adjustment to net sales 
in the past  customer returns have not been material 
vendor rebates we account for vendor rebates in accordance with the emerging issues task force issue  accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
many of our arrangements with our vendors provide for us to receive a rebate of a specified amount of consideration  payable to us when we achieve any of a number of measures  generally related to the volume level of purchases from our vendors 
we account for such rebates as a reduction of the prices of the vendor s products and therefore as a reduction of inventory until we sell the product  at which time such rebates reduce cost of sales in our income statement 
throughout the year  we estimate the amount of the rebate earned based on our estimate of purchases to date relative to the purchase levels that mark scp pool corporation part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our progress toward earning the rebates 
we continually revise these estimates to reflect actual rebates earned based on actual purchase levels 
if market conditions were to change  vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs 
although such changes would not affect the amounts we have recorded related to product already purchased  it may lower or raise our gross margins on products we sell or revenues earned in future periods 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets or liabilities based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse 
due to changing tax laws and state income tax rates  significant judgment is required to estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future 
as of december   united states taxes were not provided on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  as we have invested or expect to invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely 
if in the future these earnings are repatriated to the united states  or if we determine that the earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future  additional tax provisions may be required 
we hold  through our affiliates  cash balances in the countries in which we operate  including substantial amounts held outside the united states 
most of the amounts held outside the united states could be repatriated to the united states  but  under current law  may be subject to united states federal income taxes  less applicable foreign tax credits 
repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws including the imposition of withholding taxes in some jurisdictions 
we have not provided for the united states federal tax liability on these amounts and for financial statement purposes  these foreign cash balances are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the united states 
the american jobs creation act of  enacted on october  the jobs act  provides for a temporary dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a one year period 
the deduction would result in an approximate federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings 
to qualify for the deduction  the earnings must be reinvested in the united states pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan established by a company s chief executive officer and approved by its board of directors 
certain other criteria in the jobs act must be satisfied as well 
the maximum amount of our foreign earnings  if any  that qualify for the temporary deduction has not been determined 
the one year period during which we may make the qualifying distributions is fiscal we are in the process of evaluating whether we have foreign earnings that qualify for the dividend received deduction and whether we will repatriate all or a portion of any qualifying foreign earnings 
we have not determined the range of reasonably possible amounts that we may repatriate or an estimate of the possible united states federal and state income tax expense related to repatriation 
we do not anticipate that the united states federal and state income tax will be material 
we expect to determine the amounts and sources of foreign earnings to be repatriated  if any  by the third quarter of fiscal scp pool corporation part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we have operations in states and six foreign countries 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to adjustment by the applicable tax authorities 
we are currently under examination by federal and state income tax authorities 
our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
as a result of these uncertainties  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire a company over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired  less liabilities assumed 
at december   our goodwill balance was million  representing of total assets and of stockholders equity 
we account for goodwill under the provisions of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
under these rules  we test goodwill for impairment annually or at any other time when impairment indicators exist 
in october  we performed our annual goodwill impairment test  which requires comparison of our estimated fair value to our book value  including goodwill 
in accordance with sfas  we retested goodwill for impairment as of december  after we divested a portion of our goodwill in connection with the divestiture of our manufacturing facilities in fort wayne  indiana and quebec  canada 
as a result of these tests  we believe the goodwill on our balance sheet is not impaired 
if circumstances change or events occur to indicate that our fair market value has fallen below book value  we will compare the estimated fair value of the goodwill to its book value 
if the book value of goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value of goodwill  we will recognize the difference as an impairment loss in operating income

the table below presents some of the possible effects resulting from various weather conditions weather possible effects hot and dry increased purchases of chemicals and supplies for existing swimming pools increased purchases of above ground pools unseasonably cool weather or fewer pool installations extraordinary amounts of rain decreased purchases of chemicals and supplies decreased purchases of impulse items such as above ground pools and accessories unseasonably early warming trends a longer pool season  thus increasing our sales primarily in the northern half of the us unseasonably late warming trends a shorter pool season  thus decreasing our sales primarily in the northern half of the us for example  in  we believe our operating results were impacted by the less than favorable weather conditions throughout much of the united states 
although we experienced favorable weather conditions in the western portion of the united states  much of the central and northeastern regions experienced unusually cold and wet conditions in the peak summer season  which adversely impacted our business 
in general  sales and operating income are highest during the second and third quarters  which represent the peak months of swimming pool use and installation 
sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters when we may incur net losses 
in  approximately of net sales were generated in the second and third quarters of the year  and approximately of operating income was generated in that same period 
we typically experience a build up of product inventories and accounts payable during the winter months in anticipation of the peak selling season 
excluding borrowings to finance acquisitions and share repurchases  our peak borrowing usually occurs during the second quarter  primarily because extended payment terms offered by our suppliers typically are payable in april  may and june  while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in june  july and august 
scp pool corporation part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we expect that our quarterly results of operations will continue to fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of revenue contributed by new and acquired service centers 
we attempt to open new service centers at the end of the fourth quarter or the first quarter of the subsequent year to take advantage of preseason sales programs and the following peak selling season 
the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly data for and in our opinion  this information reflects all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of this data 
due to the seasonal nature of the swimming pool industry  the results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily a good indication of results for an entire fiscal year or of continuing trends 
unaudited quarter in thousands first second third fourth first second third fourth net sales gross profit operating income loss net sales as a of annual net sales gross profit as a of annual gross profit operating income loss as a of annual operating income liquidity and capital resources liquidity is defined as the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet current cash needs 
we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities  taking into consideration the seasonal nature of our business 
significant factors which could affect our liquidity include the following cash flows generated from operating activities  the adequacy of available bank lines of credit  acquisitions  the timing and extent of share repurchases  capital expenditures  dividend payments  and the ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms 
scp pool corporation part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our primary capital needs are seasonal working capital obligations and other general corporate purposes  including acquisitions  share repurchases and dividend payments 
our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations supplemented by bank borrowings 
borrowings  together with cash from operations and seller financing  historically have been sufficient to support our growth and finance acquisitions 
our priorities for the use of cash are as follows maintenance and new service center capital expenditures estimated at to of net sales  strategic acquisitions executed opportunistically  repurchase of common stock at board defined parameters  payment of cash dividends as and when declared by the board  and repayment of debt 
on november   we entered into an unsecured syndicated senior credit facility the credit facility with a group of banks 
this credit facility replaced our previous senior secured credit facility dated november  the credit facility  which matures on november   provides for a million five year revolving credit facility  which includes sublimits for the issuance of swingline loans and standby letters of credit 
the aggregate maximum principal amount of the commitments under the credit facility may be increased from time to time by a total amount up to million 
during the twelve months ended december   we received net proceeds of million on the credit facility 
at december   there was million outstanding and million available for borrowing under the credit facility 
the average effective interest rate of the credit facility was approximately for the year ended december  our obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by all of our existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries 
borrowings and standby letters of credit under the credit facility bear interest  at our option  at either a a base rate  which is the greater of i the wachovia bank  national association prime rate or ii the overnight federal funds rate plus  or b the london interbank offered rate libor plus a spread ranging from to  with such spread in each case depending on our leverage ratio 
we are also required to pay a an annual facility fee of to  with such spread in each case depending on our leverage ratio  b an annual commercial letter of credit issuance fee of multiplied by the face amount of each letter of credit and c a letter of credit commission of to multiplied by face amount of each letter of credit  with such spread in each case depending on our leverage ratio 
the credit facility contains terms and provisions including representations  covenants and conditions customary for transactions of this type 
financial covenants include maintenance of a maximum average total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
other covenants include restrictions on our ability to  among other things  pay dividends or make other capital distributions other than in accordance with our current dividend policy 
the credit facility contains customary events of default 
if an event of default occurs and is continuing under the credit facility  the lenders may terminate their obligations thereunder and may require us to repay all amounts thereunder 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements 
scp pool corporation part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued at december   we had outstanding borrowings of million under our accounts receivable securitization facility the receivables facility 
in the first quarter of  we renewed the receivables facility  which has a seasonal borrowing capacity up to million  through march the receivables facility provides for the true sale of certain of our receivables as they are created to a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote subsidiary 
this subsidiary grants an undivided security interest in the receivables to an unrelated commercial paper conduit 
because of the structure of the bankruptcy remote subsidiary and our ability to control its activities  we include the transferred receivables and related debt in our consolidated balance sheet 
we employed this arrangement because it provides us with a lower cost form of financing 
at december   the average effective interest rate of the receivables facility was approximately 
at december   our contractual obligations of long term debt and operating leases were as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual less than years and obligations total year years years thereafter long term debt short term financing operating leases net cash provided by operating activities was million  or of net income  compared to net cash provided by operations of million in in  we continued to secure better vendor terms reducing our average days payable outstanding by eight days and increasing terms discounts by million 
in  net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million from million in this increase is due to an increase in net income and improved working capital management as we continued to better manage our inventory  and generally improved discipline on working capital 
additionally  we realized the cash benefit from the consolidation closing of service centers acquired in the fort wayne pools transaction 
initially  acquisitions are financed through increased bank borrowings  and those borrowings are then reduced with cash flows from operations 
the same principle applies for funds used for share repurchases and capital expenditures 
we believe we have adequate availability of capital to fund present operations and anticipated growth  including expansion in existing and targeted market areas 
we continually evaluate potential acquisitions and hold discussions with acquisition candidates 
if suitable acquisition opportunities or working capital needs arise that would require additional financing  we believe that our financial position and earnings history provide a solid base for obtaining additional financing resources at competitive rates and terms 
additionally  we may issue common or preferred stock to raise funds 
scp pool corporation part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable increased million  or  to million at december   compared to million at december  this increase is consistent with the increase in net sales between years 
the allowance for doubtful accounts decreased to million at december  from million at december  the allowance represented of the accounts receivable greater than days past due in december compared to in december product inventories and the reserve for shrink and obsolescence product inventories increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  at december   the inventory reserve of million was unchanged from the prior year 
the slowest moving class of inventory decreased approximately million from to share repurchase program as part of our share repurchase program  in we purchased million shares of our common stock at an average price of per share 
we subsequently canceled these shares 
the impact of our common stock repurchases had the effect of reducing diluted weighted average shares outstanding by approximately million shares for the year ended december  on february   million remained available under the authorization of our board of directors for future share repurchases 
we intend to continue to repurchase shares on the open market from time to time  depending on market conditions 
we may use cash flows from operations to fund these purchases  or we may incur additional debt 
scp pool corporation cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of our disclosure and analysis in this report contains forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
our forward looking statements express our current expectations or forecasts of possible future results or events  including projections of future performance  statements of management s plans and objectives  future contracts  and forecasts of trends and other matters 
you can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts and often use words such as anticipate  estimate  expect  believe  will likely result  outlook  project and other words and expressions of similar meaning 
no assurance can be given that the results in any forward looking statements will be achieved and actual results could be affected by one or more factors  which could cause them to differ materially 
for these statements  we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act 
certain factors that may affect our business and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements include the following we are susceptible to adverse weather conditions 
weather is the principal external factor affecting our business 
for example  unseasonably late warming trends can decrease the length of the pool season and unseasonably cool weather or extraordinary rainfall during the peak season can decrease swimming pool use  installation and maintenance  which adversely affects sales of our products 
our business is highly seasonal 
in  approximately of our net sales were generated in the second and third quarters of the year  which represent the peak months of swimming pool use  installation  remodeling and repair  and of our operating income was generated in the same period 
our sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters of the year  when we may incur net losses 
we face intense competition both from other leisure product alternatives and from within the pool industry 
we face competition from both outside our industry with sellers of other leisure product alternatives  such as boats and motor homes  and from within our industry with various regional and local distributors and  to a lesser extent  mass market retailers and large pool supply retailers 
new competitors may emerge as there are low barriers to entry in our industry 
some geographic markets that we serve  particularly our largest  higher density markets in california  florida  texas and arizona  representing approximately of our net sales in  also tend to be more competitive than others 
more aggressive competition by mass merchants could adversely affect our sales 
mass market retailers today carry a limited range of  and devote a limited amount of shelf space to  merchandise and products targeted to the pool industry 
historically  mass market retailers have generally expanded by adding new stores and product breadth  but their product offering of pool related products has remained relatively constant 
should mass market retailers increase their focus on the pool industry or increase the breadth of their pool related product offerings and become a more significant competitor for direct and end use customers  this could have an adverse impact on our business 
scp pool corporation cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of continued the demand for our swimming pool and leisure related products may be adversely affected by economic downturns 
in economic downturns  the demand for swimming pool or leisure related products may decline as discretionary consumer spending  the increase in pool eligible households and swimming pool construction decline 
although maintenance products and repair and replacement equipment that must be purchased by pool owners to maintain existing swimming pools account for more than of our gross profits  the growth of our business depends on the expansion of the installed pool base  which may be viewed by most consumers as a discretionary expenditure that may be adversely affected by economic downturns 
the nature of our business subjects us to compliance with environmental  health  transportation and safety regulations 
we are subject to regulation under federal  state and local environmental  health  transportation and safety requirements  which govern such things as packaging  labeling  handling  transportation  storage and sale of pool chemicals and other products 
for example  we sell algaecides that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide  fungicide and rodenticide act and state pesticide laws  which primarily relate to labeling and annual registration 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil  and criminal penalties or the imposition of injunctive relief 
moreover  compliance with such laws and regulations in the future could prove to be costly  and there can be no assurance that we will not incur such costs in material amounts 
these laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last years  and we anticipate that there will be continuing changes 
the clear trend in environmental  health  transportation and safety regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that impact the environment  such as the use and handling of chemical substances 
increasingly  strict restrictions and limitations have resulted in increased operating costs for us  and it is possible that the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations will continue to increase 
we will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and to plan accordingly in order to remain in compliance with changing regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance 
we store chemicals and other combustible materials that involve fire  safety and casualty risks 
we store chemicals  including certain combustible  oxidizing compounds  at our service centers 
a fire  explosion or flood affecting one of our facilities could give rise to fire  safety and casualty losses and related liability claims 
we maintain what we believe is prudent insurance protection 
however  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable or that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise 
successful claims for which we are not fully insured may adversely affect our working capital and profitability 
in addition  changes in the insurance industry have generally led to higher insurance costs and decreased availability of coverage 
scp pool corporation cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of continued we may not be able to sustain our pace of growth 
we have experienced substantial sales growth in recent years through acquisitions and the opening of new locations that have increased our size  scope and geographic distribution 
since  we have opened new service centers and have completed acquisitions  consisting of service centers net of service center closings and consolidations 
while we contemplate continued growth through acquisitions and internal expansion  no assurance can be made as to our ability to penetrate new markets  identify appropriate acquisition candidates  complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms and successfully integrate acquired businesses  obtain financing  generate sufficient cash flows to support expansion plans and general operating activities  maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships  and identify and divest assets which do not continue to create value consistent with our objectives 
if we do not manage these potential difficulties successfully  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we depend on key personnel 
our future success depends to an extent upon the continued service of manuel perez de la mesa  our chief executive officer  and to a lesser degree  our other executive officers and key management personnel  and on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
the loss of mr 
perez de la mesa in particular could have a material adverse effect on our business 
mr 
perez de la mesa is not nearing retirement age  and we have no indication that he intends to retire in the near future 
we do not currently maintain key man insurance on mr 
perez de la mesa 
our distribution business is highly dependent on our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers and manufacturers 
as a distribution company  maintaining favorable relationships with our suppliers is critical to the success of our business 
we believe that we add considerable value to the swimming pool supply chain by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and distributing the products to a highly fragmented customer base on conditions that are more favorable than these customers could obtain on their own 
we believe that we currently enjoy good relationships with our suppliers  who generally offer us competitive pricing  return policies and promotional allowances 
however  our inability to maintain favorable relationships with our suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business 
our largest suppliers are pentair corporation  hayward pool products  inc and waterpik technologies  inc  which accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the costs of products we sold in while we do not believe that the loss of any single supplier would adversely affect our business  a decision by several suppliers  acting in concert  to sell their products directly to retail customers and other end users of their products  bypassing distribution companies like ours  would have an adverse effect on our business 
we dedicate significant resources promoting the benefits and affordability of pool ownership  which we believe greatly benefits our customers and suppliers 
scp pool corporation cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of continued the growth of our business depends on effective marketing programs 
the growth of our business depends on the expansion of the installed pool base 
thus  an important part of our strategy is to promote the growth of the pool industry through our extensive advertising and promotional programs that attempt to raise consumer awareness regarding the benefits and affordability of pool ownership  the ease of pool maintenance and the many ways in which a pool may be enjoyed beyond swimming 
these programs include media advertising  website development such as www 
swimmingpool 
com and public relations campaigns 
we believe these programs benefit the entire supply chain from our suppliers to our customers 
we also promote the growth of our customers businesses through comprehensive support programs that offer promotional tools and marketing support to help generate increased sales for our customers 
our programs include such things as personalized websites  brochures  marketing campaigns and business development training 
we also provide certain retail store customers with assistance in site selection  store layout and design and business management system implementation 
our inability to sufficiently develop effective advertising  marketing and promotional programs to succeed in an weakened economic environment and an increasingly competitive marketplace  in which we and our entire supply chain also compete with other luxury product alternatives  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
a terrorist attack or the threat of a terrorist attack could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the terrorist attacks that took place on september   in the us were unprecedented events that have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which may materially impact our business 
discretionary spending on leisure products such as ours is generally adversely affected during times of economic uncertainty 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks  and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties  which could adversely affect our business for the short or long term in ways that cannot presently be predicted 
scp pool corporation item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  including interest rate risk and foreign currency risk 
the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below 
the following discussion does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist following such changes 
further  in the event of changes of such magnitude  we would likely take actions to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
interest rate risk our earnings are exposed to changes in short term interest rates because of the variable interest rates on our debt 
if i the variable rates on our credit facility and our receivables facility increased or decreased from the rate at december   and ii we borrowed the maximum amount available under the credit facility million and the receivables facility million for all of  then our pretax income would change by approximately million and earnings per share would change by per diluted share based on the number of weighed average diluted shares outstanding at december  the fair value of our credit facility is not affected by changes in market interest rates 
foreign exchange risk we have wholly owned subsidiaries in canada  mexico  the united kingdom  france  portugal and spain 
in the past  we have not hedged our foreign currency exposure  and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results 
future changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively impact our revenues  operating expenses and earnings 
due to the size of our foreign operations  however  we do not anticipate that exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations will be material in functional currencies canada canadian dollar mexico peso united kingdom british pound france euro portugal euro spain euro
