management overview sharper image corporation referred to as the sharper image  we  us  our is a leading specialty retailer of innovative  high quality products that are useful and entertaining and are designed to make life easier and more enjoyable 
we market and sell our merchandise primarily through four integrated sales channels the sharper image stores  the sharper image catalog  which includes revenue from all direct marketing activities and television infomercials  the internet  and wholesale 
we also market to other businesses through our corporate sales  where revenues are recorded in each of our four sales channels 
our fiscal years are ended january  fiscal or  january  fiscal or  and january  fiscal or 
restatement of financial statements on february   the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission sec issued a letter in which it expressed its views regarding certain operating lease accounting issues and their application under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
we subsequently reviewed our lease related accounting practices and determined that a correction was required in the way we accounted for our leases  specifically the accounting for rent holidays 
before this correction  we recognized the straight line expense for leases beginning on the commencement date of the lease  generally the store opening date  this has the effect of excluding the stores construction and pre opening periods from the total time over which we expensed rent 
as a result  we corrected our accounting to include the construction and pre opening period in determining our straight line rent and to capitalize rent expense during the stores construction period and to amortize that capitalized rent over the lease period or the life of the leasehold improvements  whichever is shorter 
the aggregate effect of this correction resulted in a decrease in retained earnings of approximately thousand on an after tax basis through january   and an increase to capitalized assets of approximately million and deferred rent of approximately million as of january  in addition  as part of the company s self assessment and self testing of its internal controls over financial reporting under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  management identified an error in certain accounts within accounts payable  as reported in its previously issued financial statements 
the error occurred in certain calculations and inventory valuation adjustments  resulting in an understatement of accounts payable and an overstatement of net income 
the effect of this correction reduced net income on an after tax basis by approximately million for the first nine months of the fiscal year ended january   by approximately million for fiscal year ended january   and by approximately thousand for the fiscal year ended january  the company s retained earnings decreased by approximately million on an after tax basis for the aggregate effect of the correction through january see note b of notes to financial statements for a description of the company s restatement included in item herein 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  many of which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions see note a to the financial statements 
we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operation 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue at the point of sale at its retail stores and at the time of customer receipt for our catalog and direct marketing sales  including the internet 
we recognize revenue for sales to resellers of sales made on a wholesale basis when the products are shipped  which occurs at the time title passes to the purchaser 
estimated reductions to revenue for customer returns are recorded based on our historical return rates 
revenues are recorded net of sale discounts and other rebates and incentives offered to customers 
deferred revenue represents merchandise certificates  gift cards and reward cards outstanding and unfilled cash orders at the end of the fiscal period 
delivery revenue is recognized at the time of customer receipt 
merchandise inventories 
we record inventory at the lower of weighted average cost or market value 
we reserve for obsolescence based on the difference between the weighted average cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional reserves may be required 
accounts receivable 
counterparties to our accounts receivable include credit card issuers  corporate marketing incentive customers  wholesale customers  installment plan customers  merchandise vendors  and landlords from whom we expect to receive amounts due 
an allowance for credit losses is recorded based on estimates of customers ability to pay 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets for impairment when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flow estimated to be generated by those assets is less than the asset s carrying amount 
our policy is to evaluate long lived assets for impairment at a store level for retail operations and an operating unit level for our other operations 
our retail stores typically take months to achieve their full profit potential 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than management s projections  future write offs may be necessary 
income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events then known to management that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
in estimating future tax consequences  all expected future events then known to management are considered other than changes in the tax law or rates

total revenue increased million or from the prior fiscal year 
the increase in total revenue for fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to the opening of net new stores during fiscal increases in net wholesale sales and net internet sales and to a lesser extent  the decrease in returns and allowances described below 
the popularity of our sharper image design and sharper image branded products continues to be a key factor in the increases in total revenues in all our selling channels 
sales of sharper image design and sharper image branded products increased to approximately of total revenues in fiscal from approximately for fiscal we believe that the increase in the percentage of revenues 
table of contents attributable to sharper image design and sharper image branded products was due to the modification of certain third party branded products making them exclusive to sharper image branded product offerings and the introduction of the professional series line of ionic breeze silent air purifiers in the third fiscal quarter of  and other key sharper image design proprietary products 
we believe that the continued development and introduction of new and popular products is a key strategic objective and important to our future success 
the increase in net sales was partially offset by a comparable store sales decrease of from fiscal we also believe that the increased investment in our advertising initiatives in fiscal and  which include the significant increase in television infomercial advertising and internet advertising  primarily highlighting selected sharper image design and sharper image branded products and the increase in catalogs circulated contributed to the higher revenues in all selling channels 
returns and allowances for fiscal were sales  as compared to for fiscal  resulting in an million increase in total revenues in all selling channels 
we believe that the decrease in returns and allowances for fiscal as compared to fiscal is due primarily to improved quality control in the production of various top selling sharper image branded products that have resulted from improvements made in response to customer feedback and lower return rates on certain electronic products 
net store sales for fiscal increased million  or  while comparable store sales decreased by from fiscal the increase in net store sales was attributable primarily to the opening of new stores during fiscal  a increase in total store transactions for fiscal and a increase in the average revenue per transaction  as compared to fiscal the increase in net store sales was partially offset by a comparable store sales decrease of from fiscal  a soft economy marked by consumers lack of willingness to spend  some new production introductions that proved less popular than anticipated  and congestion at west coast ports  particularly in the fourth quarter  which generated extra freight costs and caused a shortage of key holiday items during critical selling weeks  and the closure of two stores at lease maturity 
the increase in average revenue per transaction was attributable primarily to the overall product mix offered  and multimedia advertising strategies  including infomercial advertising highlighting sharper image design and sharper image branded products  particularly our air purification products 
average net sales per square foot for fiscal for all stores decreased to from in fiscal average net sales per square foot for the company s comparable store base for fiscal was as compared to in the same prior year period 
average net sales per square foot is calculated by averaging over all stores the amount of each store s net sales divided by that store s total square footage under lease 
average revenue per transaction is calculated by dividing the amount of gross sales  exclusive of delivery revenue and sales taxes  per channel by the gross number of transactions in that channel 
comparable store sales is not a measure that has been defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we define comparable store sales as sales from stores where selling square feet did not change by more than in the previous months and which have been open for at least months 
a store opened on or prior to the th of a month is treated as open for the entire month 
stores generally become comparable once they have a full year of comparable sales for its annual calculation 
we believe that comparable store sales  which excludes the effect of a change in the number of stores open  provides a more useful measure of the performance of our store sales channel than does the absolute change in aggregate net store sales 
the decrease in comparable store sales for fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to lower than optimal inventory levels of popular merchandise  product introductions that did not generate high demands during the fiscal year and high consumer demand for other popular gift items not available during the holiday season 
net catalog and direct marketing sales  which includes direct sales generated from catalog mailings  single product mailers  print advertising and television infomercials  for fiscal increased million or  from fiscal this increase was due primarily to a increase in television infomercial advertising expense  a increase in the sharper image catalog pages circulated  which includes a increase in the sharper image catalogs circulated  partially offset by a decrease in single product mailers circulated 
the increase in net catalog and direct marketing sales for fiscal reflects an increase in average revenue per transaction  partially offset by a decrease in transactions and compared to fiscal 
table of contents for fiscal and  and of the net catalog and direct marketing sales were generated from television infomercial direct sales 
we intend to continue our aggressive multimedia advertising programs during fiscal to attract new customers while achieving a favorable return on advertising investment 
our goal is to achieve direct response sales resulting in near breakeven results on all direct marketing advertising initiatives 
we continually reviews our advertising initiatives  including the pages and number of catalogs and single product mailers circulated  and the amount of and return on investment from television infomercial advertising  in our efforts to improve revenues from catalog and direct marketing advertising 
net internet sales  from our www 
sharperimage 
com website and the sharper image and ebay auction websites in fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal this increase was attributable primarily to a increase in internet transactions and a increase in average revenue per transaction resulting from a increase in internet advertising which includes paid for search engine key word placement and revenue share costs incurred for affiliate programs net wholesale sales for fiscal year increased million  or  compared to fiscal the increase is attributable primarily due to increasing sharper image design product sales to our existing wholesale customer base and to test programs with new wholesale customers 
we believe that the wholesale business  pursued with select partners  will continue to strengthen our brand name and broaden our customer base 
cost of products 
cost of products for fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal this increase is due primarily to the higher sales volume 
the gross margin rate for fiscal was as compared to the fiscal rate of 
the decrease in the gross margin rate was a result of a combination of increased air freight related to the west coast port slowdown  higher unit cost for certain third party products  increases in promotional and incentive activities and selective product markdowns offset by the increased gross margin from wholesale sales 
our gross margin rate fluctuates with changes in our merchandise mix  primarily sharper image design and sharper image branded products  which changes as we make new items available in various categories or introduce new proprietary products 
the variation in merchandise mix from category to category from year to year is characteristic of sales results being driven by individual products rather than by general product lines 
additionally  the auction sites and other selected promotional activities  such as free shipping offers  in part tend to offset the rate of increase in gross margin rate 
our gross margins may not be comparable to those of other retailers  since some retailers include the costs related to their distribution network in cost of products while we  and other retailers  exclude them from gross margin and include them instead in general  selling and administrative expenses 
we cannot accurately predict future gross margin rates  although our goal is to continue to increase sales of sharper image design and sharper image branded products to capitalize on the higher margins realized on these products 
buying and occupancy 
buying and occupancy costs for fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal this increase reflects a full year of occupancy costs for the new stores opened in fiscal  the occupancy costs associated with the new stores opened in fiscal and rent increases for some existing store locations upon lease renewal  partially offset by two store closures during fiscal and by three store closures during fiscal buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of total revenues increased to in fiscal from for fiscal in fiscal  we opened a total of new stores  achieving our goal of a increase in the number of stores opened on an annual basis 
our goal is to continue to increase new store openings by approximately in fiscal but we cannot assure you we will achieve this goal 
advertising 
advertising expenses for fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal the increase in advertising expense was attributable primarily to a increase in television infomercial 
table of contents advertising expense  a increase in magazine and print advertising  and a increase in internet advertising  which includes search engine key word placement and revenue share costs incurred for affiliate programs  which was partially offset by a decrease in radio advertising 
also contributing to the increase in advertising was a increase in the number of the sharper image catalog pages circulated  which includes a increase in the number of the sharper image catalogs circulated 
during fiscal  we continued our other multimedia advertising initiatives  which included radio  television and print advertising  among others 
although we believe these initiatives contributed to the increase in sales in the stores  catalog and direct marketing and internet channels  there can be no assurance of the continued success of these advertising initiatives 
advertising expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal we believe that expansion of all advertising initiatives contributed to the sales increases for fiscal and increased brand awareness 
our advertising strategy will continue to be an important factor in our future revenue growth 
however  we expect to review the return on investment of its advertising campaigns to ensure that advertising costs are reasonable and effective for us 
we expect to continue to spend on advertising and marketing at significant levels in fiscal  but at slightly lower levels than fiscal general  selling and administrative 
general  selling and administrative gs a expenses for fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal contributing to this increase was an increase of million due primarily to variable expenses from increased net sales 
also contributing to the increase were increases of million for professional fees  including legal and accounting fees resulting from sarbanes oxley compliance  million for distribution center shipping costs incurred for product delivery to our retail store locations and to increased airfreight costs due to the west coast port slowdown and million for depreciation and amortization expense related to technological enhancements and the expansion of our distribution centers 
gs a expenses for fiscal as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at as compared to fiscal other income expense 
the increase in other expense is primarily due to the disposal of certain fixed assets  partially offset by interest income earned on higher investment balances generated from the proceeds from our public stock offering and improved operating results 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns
