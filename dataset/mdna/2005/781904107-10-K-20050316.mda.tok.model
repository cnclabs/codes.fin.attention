item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
we have committed a substantial amount of capital to upgrade our wireless voice networks to offer advanced data services 
if the demand for wireless data services does not grow  or if we fail to capitalize on such demand  it could have an adverse effect on our growth potential 
we have committed significant resources to wireless data services and our business plan assumes increasing demand for such services 
although demand for wireless data services is growing  it is currently a small portion of our revenues 
continued growth in demand for wireless data services is dependent on development and availability of popular applications and availability of handsets and other wireless devices with features  functionality  and pricing desired by customers 
if applications and devices are not developed or do not become commercially acceptable  our revenues could be adversely affected 
even if such demand does develop  our ability to deploy and deliver wireless data services relies  in many instances  on new and unproven technology 
existing technology may not perform as expected  and we may not be able to obtain new technology to effectively and economically deliver these services 
we cannot give assurance that there will be widespread demand for advanced wireless data services  that revenues from data services will constitute a significant portion of our total revenues in the near future  or that we can provide such services on a profitable basis 
our business could be materially and adversely affected by our failure to anticipate and react to frequent and significant technological changes 
the telecommunications industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technology that are evidenced by the increasing pace of g digital upgrades  evolving industry standards  the availability of new radio frequency spectrum allocations for wireless services  ongoing improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology  shorter development cycles for new products and enhancements  developments in emerging wireless transmission technologies  and changes in end user requirements and preferences 
it is possible that we may select a technology that does not achieve widespread commercial success or that is not compatible with the technology selected by one or more of our roaming partners  and as a result  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
moreover  one or more of the technologies that we currently utilize may become inferior or obsolete at some time in the future 
a significant portion of our revenue is from roaming charges 
based on industry trends  outcollect roaming yields have been declining over the last few years and are expected to continue to decline in the future 
as a result  our future operating results could be adversely affected if increases in roaming minutes do not offset anticipated decreases in roaming yield 
in   and  approximately   and  respectively  of our revenue was derived from roaming charges incurred by other wireless providers for use of our network by their customers who traveled within our coverage areas 
a substantial portion of our roaming revenue is derived from cingular  verizon wireless  and t mobile 
changes in their operations or a significant decline in the number of their customers could adversely affect our business 
for the years ended december    and  cingular on a pro forma basis giving effect to its merger with at t wireless awe  verizon wireless  and t mobile accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of our total outcollect roaming minutes 
for the years ended december    and  cingular on a pro forma basis giving effect to its merger with awe accounted for approximately   and of 
table of contents our total revenue 
changes in the network footprints of these providers could have a material adverse effect on our outcollect revenue and incollect expenses 
for example  if a roaming partner from which we derive a significant amount of revenue in one of our service areas were to build its own network in that service area  our outcollect revenue derived from our roaming relationship with that partner in that service area might decrease or even cease altogether  and our ability to negotiate favorable incollect rates in that partner s other service areas could suffer as well 
our most significant roaming partners are performing overlays of their existing networks with g technology at an accelerated pace 
we believe that during these partners converted their customer base to this new technology before we had completed our network overlays 
reflecting the transition of our networks and our roaming partners g technology customer base  we believe we did not capture a portion of available roaming revenue 
with our g networks substantially completed in our northeast and northwest regions as of january  three of our four regions are now overlaid with g network technology 
our south region may continue to lose roaming minutes until its upgrade is completed in the summer of further  if we encounter delays in completing our overlays  we could miss upgrade milestones in our roaming agreements or our roaming partners may decide to expand their networks into our service areas in order to provide coverage for their customers 
failure to meet upgrade milestones may result in reduced outcollect rates or loss of preferred roaming status under our roaming agreements 
any overbuild of our service areas by our roaming partners would also result in increased competition  which could have a negative impact on our outcollect roaming revenues  business  operating results  and retention 
our roaming agreements have varying terms  from month to month to up to five years  and some are terminable with days written notice 
when these agreements expire or are terminated  we may be unable to renegotiate these roaming agreements or to obtain roaming agreements with other wireless providers upon acceptable terms 
failure to obtain acceptable roaming agreements could lead to a substantial decline in our revenue and operating income 
our roaming revenue is subject to some effects of seasonality  and as a result  our overall revenue and operating income are also subject to seasonal fluctuations 
in   and  a substantial amount of our revenue was derived from roaming charges incurred by other wireless providers for use of our network by their customers who traveled within our service areas 
our service areas include a number of resort destinations 
as a result  our roaming revenue increases during vacation periods  introducing a measure of seasonality to our revenue and operating income 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other matters seasonality 
we operate in a very competitive business environment  which can adversely affect our business and operations 
competitors who offer more services than we do may attract our targeted customers 
we operate in highly competitive markets  and there is substantial and increasing competition in all aspects of the wireless communications business 
some competitors may market services we do not offer  such as cable television  internet access  landline local exchange  or long distance services  which may make their services more attractive to customers 
competition for customers is based primarily upon services and features offered  system coverage  technical quality of wireless systems  price  customer service  capacity  and strength of distribution channels 

table of contents in each of our markets we compete with several other wireless licensees 
to a lesser extent  we also compete with wireless internet  paging  dispatch services  resellers  and landline telephone service providers in some of our service areas 
increasingly  cellular services have become a viable alternative to landline voice services for certain customers  putting cellular licensees in direct competition with traditional landline telephone service providers 
cable companies are providing telecommunications services to the home  and of these  some carriers are providing local and long distance voice services using voice over internet protocol  or voip 
in particular circumstances  these carriers may be able to avoid payment of access charges to local exchange carriers for the use of their networks on long distance calls 
cost savings for these carriers could result in lower rates for customers and increased competition for wireless services 
continuing industry consolidation has resulted in an increased presence of regional and national wireless operators within some of our service areas 
many of these national market competitors provide services comparable to ours and  because they operate in a wider geographic area  are able to offer no or low cost roaming and toll calls over a wider area 
in addition  some national wireless operators have recently begun to build networks in certain of the more densely populated or well traveled portions of our service areas 
national advertising and promotional programs by national wireless operators run in our markets are also a source of additional competitive and pricing pressures  even though these operators may not provide service in those markets 
if the wireless communications industry continues to consolidate and we do not participate in that consolidation  even stronger competitors may be created 
in  the fcc eliminated the spectrum cap in all markets and the cellular cross interest restriction in the larger urban cellular markets 
effective july  the fcc also eliminated the cellular cross interest restriction in rural service areas 
these regulatory actions may facilitate the creation of larger and more formidable competitors 
several of our competitors also operate in multiple segments of the industry 
in the future  we expect to face increased competition from entities providing similar services using other communications technologies 
given the rapid advances in the wireless communications industry  there can be no assurance that new technologies will not evolve that will compete with our products and services 
in addition  a number of our competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  sales  and distribution resources 
with so many companies targeting many of the same customers  we may not be able to successfully attract and retain customers and grow our customer base and revenues  which could have a materially adverse effect on our future business  strategy  operations  and financial condition 
market prices for wireless service may decline in the future 
we expect significant price competition among wireless providers that may lead to increasing movement of customers between competitors resulting in reductions in average monthly service revenue per customer 
while we try to maintain or grow our customer base and average monthly service revenue per customer  we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so 
if market prices decline it could adversely affect our our financial condition and results of operations 
wireless number portability may continue to have a negative impact on our customer retention and increase our marketing costs 
wireless number portability allows customers to keep their wireless phone number when switching to a different service provider 
our service areas are in compliance with the federal communications commission fcc mandate that requires wireless carriers to provide wireless number portability 
wireless number portability has increased and may continue to increase competition and reduce retention 
since implementation of wireless number portability in our markets  we have experienced increased churn 
a high rate of churn would adversely affect our results of operations by reducing revenue and increasing the cost of adding a new customer 
such costs generally include commission expense and or significant handset discounts  which are significant factors in income and profitability for participants in the wireless industry 
we may be required to grant promotional credits  subsidize product upgrades  and or reduce pricing to match competitors initiatives and to retain customers  which could adversely impact our operating results 

table of contents if we encounter significant problems  such as delays  inaccuracies  or loss of customer information from our database  in the process of upgrading our billing function  we could experience customer dissatisfaction and increased churn  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance 
we have begun the implementation of a new data processing and billing system and expect this transition to continue over the next several months 
this process could cause disruption in our billing cycles  including delays in mailing of and errors in statements sent to customers  and customers may be dropped from our database 
if such problems are significant or prolonged  our customers may become dissatisfied and decide to switch to a rival carrier 
also  following implementation  we will be dependent on future performance of an outside contractor 
any significant or prolonged problems with our billing function could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
there will also likely be a period during which our existing billing function and our upgraded billing function will run in tandem as we transition from one system to the other 
to the extent that agreements relating to current systems and services are still in effect  we will encounter duplication of some expenses 
regulation or potential litigation relating to the use of wireless phones while driving could adversely affect our results of operations 
further  if wireless handsets are perceived to pose health and safety risks  we may be subject to new regulations  and demand for our services may decrease 
some studies have indicated that using wireless phones while driving may distract drivers attention  making accidents more likely 
these concerns could lead to litigation relating to accidents  deaths  or serious bodily injuries  or to new restrictions or regulations on wireless phone use  any of which also could have material adverse effects on our results of operations 
a number of us states and local governments are considering or have recently enacted legislation that would restrict or prohibit the use of a wireless handset while driving or  alternatively  require the use of a hands free telephone 
legislation of this sort  if enacted  would require wireless service providers to provide hands free enhanced services  such as voice activated dialing and hands free speaker phones and headsets 
if we are unable to provide hands free services and products to customers in a timely and adequate fashion  our ability to generate revenues could suffer 
it has been suggested that certain radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets may be linked to various health concerns  including cancer  and may interfere with various electronic medical devices  including hearing aids and pacemakers 
concerns over the effect of radio frequency emissions may discourage the use of wireless handsets  which would decrease demand for our services 
our business is subject to extensive government regulation  which could adversely affect our business by increasing our expenses 
we also may be unable to obtain or retain regulatory approvals necessary to operate our business  which could negatively affect our results of operations 
the fcc regulates many aspects of our business  including the licensing  construction  interconnection  operation  acquisition  and sale of our wireless systems  as well as the number of wireless licenses issued for each of our markets 
state and local regulatory authorities  to a lesser extent  also regulate aspects of our business and services 
in addition  the federal aviation administration regulates aspects of construction  marking  and lighting of communications towers on which we place our wireless transmitters 
changes in legislation and regulations governing wireless activities  wireless carriers  and availability of usf support  our failure to comply with applicable regulations  or our loss of or failure to obtain any license or licensed area could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
the fcc and state authorities are increasingly looking to the wireless industry to fund various initiatives  including federal and state universal service programs  telephone number administration  services to the hearing impaired  and emergency services 
in addition  many states have imposed significant taxes on providers in the wireless industry and have adopted or are considering adoption of regulatory requirements regarding customer billing and other matters 
these initiatives have imposed and will continue to impose 
table of contents increased costs on us and other wireless carriers and may otherwise adversely affect our business 
under phase ii of its emergency service rules  for example  the fcc has mandated that wireless providers supply the geographic coordinates of a customer s location  by means of network based or handset based technologies  to public safety dispatch agencies 
we believe that we will be able to implement most aspects of the required phase ii systems by the applicable deadlines  however  it appears unlikely that our network based systems will be able to comply fully with the fcc s current accuracy requirements for these systems 
although we intend to continue working with the fcc to seek relaxed standards or extended deadlines for phase ii implementation in rural areas  there can be no assurance that the fcc ultimately will permit such relaxed standards or extended deadlines  that we will be able to comply with any such relaxed standards or extended deadlines  or that we will not be subject to fines by the fcc in connection with our failure to comply with the fcc s emergency service rules 
each of our wireless licenses is subject to renewal upon expiration of its current term  which is generally ten years 
grants of wireless license renewals are governed by fcc rules establishing a presumption in favor of incumbent licensees that have complied with their regulatory obligations during the ten year license period 
however  we cannot provide assurance that the fcc will grant us any future renewal applications or that our applications will be free from challenge 
in addition  fcc rules require wireless licensees to meet build out requirements with respect to particular licenses  and failure to comply with these and other requirements in a given licensed area could result in revocation or nonrenewal of our license for that area or the imposition of fines by the fcc 
our designation or certification as an eligible telecommunications carrier etc in any state where we conduct business could be refused  conditioned  or revoked due to circumstances beyond our control  thus depriving us of financial support in that state from the universal service funds usf 
in addition  we cannot be certain that we will continue to receive payments at the current levels 
in order to receive financial support from the usf in any state  we must receive etc certification in that state 
currently  we are etc certified in eight of the states in which we offer wireless services 
if designation or certification in these states were revoked or conditioned  our financial results could be adversely affected 
further  the fcc is currently considering whether to change the rules governing the eligibility of cellular carriers to receive usf payments 
although the fcc is not expected to make any final decisions on changes in the rules until or later  the fcc and state commissions could impose additional regulatory obligations on etcs that we may find unacceptable 
at this time  it is not clear what impact changes in the rules  if any  will have on our continued eligibility to receive usf support 
loss of usf revenues could adversely affect our future financial performance 
equipment failure and natural disasters may adversely affect our operations 
a major equipment failure or a natural disaster affecting any of our central switching offices  microwave links  or cell sites could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
our inability to operate any portion of our wireless system for an extended time period could result in a loss of customers or impair our ability to attract new customers  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
difficulties in upgrading our wireless systems could increase our planned capital expenditures  delay the continued build out of our networks  and negatively impact our roaming arrangements 
whenever we upgrade our networks  we need to select appropriate equipment vendors  select and acquire appropriate sites for our transmission equipment  or cell sites  purchase and install low power transmitters  receivers  and control equipment  or base radio equipment  build out any required physical infrastructure  obtain interconnection services from local telephone service carriers  and test cell sites 

table of contents our ability to perform these necessary steps successfully may be hindered by  among other things  any failure to obtain necessary zoning and other regulatory approvals  lease or obtain rights to sites for the location of our base radio equipment  obtain any necessary capital  acquire any additional necessary spectrum from third parties  and commence and complete the construction of sites for our equipment in a timely and satisfactory manner 
in addition  we may experience cost overruns and delays not within our control caused by acts of governmental entities  design changes  material and equipment shortages  delays in delivery  and catastrophic occurrences 
any failure to upgrade our wireless systems on a timely basis may affect our ability to provide the quality of service in our markets consistent with our current business plan  and any significant delays could have a material adverse effect on our business 
failure to meet upgrade milestones or to comply with other requirements under our roaming agreements could have an adverse effect on our roaming revenue 
our future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairments or other charges 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

as a result  we are required to test both goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  consisting primarily of our spectrum licenses  for impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach  rather than amortizing them over time 
we are also required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value 
additionally  the value of our licenses must be tested between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value might be impaired 
the amount of any such annual or interim impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

as a result  we are required to assess the impairment of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable as measured by the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates impairment of long lived assets 
any operating losses resulting from impairment charges under sfas no 
or sfas no 
could have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 
we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired or exchanged properties  which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
we seek to improve our networks and service areas through selective acquisitions of other providers properties and other assets  and in some instances  we may exchange our properties or assets for the properties and assets of another carrier 
we will be required to integrate with our operations any properties we acquire  which may have billing systems  customer care systems  and other operational characteristics that differ significantly from those of our networks 
we may be unsuccessful in those efforts  and customer retention in acquired properties and surrounding areas may suffer as a result  which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

table of contents we will continue to incur increased costs as a result of being a public company subject to the sarbanes oxley act of soa  as well as new rules implemented by the sec and the nasdaq stock market 
as a public company  we incur significant legal  accounting  and other expenses 
in addition  the soa  as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the sec and the nasdaq stock market  have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies 
we expect these new rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make certain activities more time consuming and costly 
in addition  the new rules could make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including director and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors  our board committees  or as executive officers 
our common stock price has been and may continue to be volatile 
litigation instituted against us and our officers and directors as a result of changes in the price of our securities could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  and operating results 
the trading price of our class a common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as actual or anticipated variations in operating results  our ability to finance our operations and meet obligations under our financing arrangements conditions or trends in the wireless communications industry and changes in the economic performance and or market valuation of other wireless communications companies  our strategic partnerships  joint ventures  or capital commitments  and additions or departures of key personnel 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the affected companies 
these broad market and industry factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of our securities  regardless of our actual operating performance 
often a drop in a company s stock price is followed by lawsuits against the company and its officers and directors alleging securities fraud 
the defense and eventual settlement of or judgment rendered in any such actions could result in substantial costs 
also  the defense of any such actions could divert management s attention and resources 
both the costs and the diversion of management could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  and operating results 
in addition  any material adverse judgment could trigger an event of default under our indebtedness 
we have a significant amount of debt and preferred stock  which may limit our ability to meet our debt service and dividend obligations  obtain future financing  make capital expenditures in support of our business plan  react to a downturn in our business  or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities 
as of december   we had approximately billion of long term liabilities which includes million of senior and junior exchangeable preferred stock  approximately million of class m and class t preferred stock  and shareholders deficit of approximately million 
of the outstanding preferred stock  million can be exchanged  at our option  subject to compliance with certain leverage ratios under our credit agreement and the indentures related to our senior secured  senior  and senior subordinated notes  for senior subordinated indebtedness 

table of contents the current levels of our debt and preferred stock entail a number of risks  including the following we must use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to make interest payments on our debt  thereby reducing funds that would otherwise be available to us for working capital  capital expenditures  future business opportunities  and other purposes  we may not be able to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  and other purposes on terms favorable to us or at all  borrowings under our floating rate senior secured notes and our revolving credit agreement are at variable interest rates  making us vulnerable to increases in interest rates  we may have more debt than many of our competitors  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage  we may have limited flexibility to react to changes in our business  and we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness or preferred stock on terms that are commercially reasonable or at all 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to pay the principal or liquidation preference of  and interest or preferred dividends on  our indebtedness and preferred stock is not certain 
in particular  if we do not meet our anticipated revenue growth and operating expense targets  our future debt and preferred stock service obligations could exceed the amount of our available cash 
the restrictive covenants in our existing debt and preferred stock instruments and agreements may limit our ability to operate our business 
the instruments governing our debt and the certificates of designation governing our preferred stock impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us 
these restrictions limit  among other things  our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt  pay cash dividends on capital stock  repay junior debt and preferred stock prior to stated maturities  allow the imposition of dividend restrictions on certain subsidiaries  sell assets  make investments  engage in transactions with shareholders and affiliates  create liens  and engage in some types of mergers or acquisitions 
our failure to comply with these restrictions could lead to a default under the terms of the relevant debt or a violation of the terms of the preferred stock even if we are able to meet debt service and dividend obligations 
our revolving credit agreement requires us to maintain specified financial ratios if we draw against it 
substantially all our assets are subject to liens securing indebtedness under our revolving credit agreement and senior secured notes 
these restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing  make needed capital expenditures  withstand a downturn in our business  or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities 
if there were an event of default under our revolving credit agreement or other debt  the holders of the affected debt could elect to declare all of that debt to be due and payable  which  in turn  could cause all of our other debt to become due and payable 
we might not have sufficient funds available  and we might be unable to obtain sufficient funds from alternative sources on terms favorable to us or at all 
if the amounts outstanding under our revolving credit agreement were accelerated and we could not obtain sufficient funds to satisfy our obligations  our lenders could proceed against our assets and the stock and assets of our subsidiaries that guarantee our revolving credit agreement and senior secured notes 

table of contents we are subject to limitations on our ability to pay cash dividends on and repurchase or otherwise satisfy our obligations under our senior exchangeable preferred stock and junior exchangeable preferred stock 
if we do not satisfy these obligations  the holders of these series of preferred stock may have the right to elect additional members to our board of directors 
we are required to pay dividends on our exchangeable preferred stock 
since august  dividends on our senior exchangeable preferred stock are to be paid in cash 
however  we have not declared or paid any of the cash dividends on the senior exchangeable preferred stock 
we are accruing the undeclared dividends by increasing the carrying amount of the senior exchangeable preferred stock 
at december   we had accrued million in undeclared dividends  which will be payable at the senior preferred mandatory redemption date  if not sooner declared and paid 
we currently pay dividends on our junior exchangeable preferred stock by issuing additional shares 
beginning in may  dividends on our junior exchangeable preferred stock are to be paid in cash 
our ability to pay cash dividends on and to redeem for cash our senior exchangeable preferred stock and junior exchangeable preferred stock when required is restricted under various covenants contained in documents governing our outstanding preferred stock and our indebtedness 
in addition  under minnesota law  we are permitted to pay dividends on or redeem our capital stock  including the senior exchangeable preferred stock and the junior exchangeable preferred stock  only if our board of directors determines that we will be able to pay our debts in the ordinary course of business after paying the dividends or completing the redemption 
in addition  in order to redeem the junior exchangeable preferred stock  our board of directors must determine that we have sufficient assets to satisfy the liquidation preferences of the senior exchangeable preferred stock 
because we have failed to pay at least six quarterly dividends on the senior exchangeable preferred stock  the holders of such stock currently have the right to elect the lesser of two directors or the number of directors constituting of the members of our board  if they so choose  by following the procedures set forth in the certificate of designation 
if  at any time  we have failed to pay six or more quarterly dividends on our junior exchangeable preferred stock  the holders of such stock would have the same right to elect directors 
failure to pay dividends on our preferred stock may also result in a downgrade of our credit ratings  and such a downgrade could have an adverse effect on our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness or otherwise raise capital 
we have preferred shareholders who could exercise significant influence on management 
the holders of our class m convertible preferred stock currently are able to elect two members to our board of directors and can vote  on an as converted basis  approximately  shares of our class a common stock  which represented  as of december   approximately of the voting power of our common stock 
the holders of our senior exchangeable preferred stock and junior exchangeable preferred stock  under certain circumstances  may also be able to elect members of our board of directors in the future 
because we have failed to pay at least six quarterly dividends on the senior exchangeable preferred stock  the holders of such stock currently have the right to elect the lesser of two directors or the number of directors constituting of the members of our board  if they so choose  by following the procedures set forth in the certificate of designation 
we anticipate that two directors will be elected by the holders of the senior exchangeable preferred stock at the annual meeting 
if any of these preferred stock holders or the directors elected by them were to disagree with decisions made by management or the board of directors about our plans or operations  they might be able to bring significant pressure to change such plans or operations 
antitakeover provisions could adversely affect the price of our class a common stock 
some of the provisions of our articles of incorporation  amended and restated bylaws  and minnesota law could delay or prevent a change of control or a change in management that may be beneficial to shareholders 
these provisions include provisions for a classified board of directors  provisions for advance notice for director nominations and shareholder proposals  provisions allowing holders of our class b common stock ten votes per share as compared to one vote per share for our class a common stock  
table of contents provisions for supermajority votes to approve mergers or amend specified provisions of the articles and bylaws  and statutory limits regarding share acquisitions and business combinations 
we also have adopted a rights plan that could discourage  delay  or prevent someone from acquiring us at a premium price 
the rights plan provides that preferred stock purchase rights attached to each share of our common stock become exercisable to purchase shares of common stock at of market value  causing substantial dilution to a person or group acquiring or more of our common stock if the acquisition is not approved by our board of directors 
in addition  the documents governing our indebtedness contain limitations on our ability to enter into a change of control transaction 
under these documents  the occurrence of a change of control transaction  in some cases after notice and grace periods  would constitute an event of default permitting acceleration of the indebtedness 
a general development of business we are a wireless communications service provider focusing primarily on rural markets in the united states 
our principal operating objective is to increase revenue and achieve profitability through increased penetration in existing wireless markets 
our operating regions include portions of five states in the northeast  three states in the northwest  four states in the midwest  and three states in the south 
within each of our four regions  we have deployed a strong local sales and customer service presence in the communities we serve 
our marketed networks covered a total population of approximately million pops and served approximately  voice customers as of december  the following table summarizes our existing wireless systems as of december  post and prepaid customers not including paging and long distance customers percentage service area as of december  square ownership pops miles states cellular midwest     mn  nd  sd northeast     ma  me  nh  ny  vt south     al  ks  ms northwest     id  or  wa total pcs wireless alliance     mn  nd  sd  wi wholesale n a   n a total reflects us census bureau population data updated for december customers as of december  are provided on a pro forma basis  giving effect to the property exchange with awe  completed on march   in which the company transferred to awe its northwest region operations in oregon rsa  including approximately  customers as of december  the company received from awe certain of its operations in alabama and mississippi  increasing its customers in the south region by approximately  customers as of december  
table of contents we believe our market characteristics and network quality make us an attractive roaming partner for other wireless communications service providers 
we have preferred roaming relationships with cingular wireless  llc  t mobile  and verizon wireless in our various regions 
we began a g network overlay process in late  which we expect to be substantially complete in we are also pursuing a strategy of expanding our network coverage in all of our regions  which will  upon completion  increase our cell sites and total marketed pops 
we believe our network overlay and expansion efforts will improve our ability to attract customers in addition to providing our roaming partners greater access to our networks 
summary of year ended december  our operating highlights reflect progress on our g network buildouts  transition of the acquired awe operations in our south region  wireless number portability compliance  increased etc certification in certain states which allows us to receive usf payments  and repurchases of senior preferred stock 
service revenue increased for the year ended december  to million in spite of a  net customer decrease resulting from the awe property exchange completed on march  these results reflect an increase in usf support payments  which increased to million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   lsr increased to as compared to in the previous year 
contributing to the increase in lsr were increased levels of usf of approximately together with increased access and features revenue of approximately during the year ended december   our total customers decreased by to  at december  as compared to  at december  we believe the reasons contributing to the decrease include the following the net customer decline resulting from the property exchange with awe  the transitional stage of our networks  products  and services  the transition to a unified brand name across all regions  and wireless local number portability 
roaming revenue for the year ended december  was million as compared to million in the year ended december  roaming revenue this year was lower than in primarily because of the oregon property exchange with awe  which occurred in march  declining roaming yield  and the accelerated transition by our national roaming partners to g handsets 
for the year ended december   the oregon service area provided approximately million of roaming revenue compared to approximately million for the year ended december  outcollect roaming yield for was per minute as compared to per minute last year 
at december   approximately of our cell sites have been overlaid with g technology 
we expect outcollect roaming revenues for all of to be comparable to we expect capital spending for to be approximately million as compared to million in in march  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due and million aggregate principal amount of senior secured floating rate notes due the net proceeds from these notes  together with some of our existing cash  were used to repay all outstanding obligations under our former credit agreement  to terminate interest rate exchange agreements associated with the former credit agreement  and to pay fees and expenses associated with the notes offering and the revolving credit agreement 

table of contents during the year ended december   we repurchased  shares of our senior exchangeable preferred stock for million 
the corresponding million gain on redemption of preferred shares was recorded as a reduction of interest expense 
b financial information about segments our business consists of one reportable operating segment  the operation of wireless communication systems in the united states 
c description of business service areas marketing of products and services local service we have developed our marketing strategy on a market by market basis and offer service plan options to our customers tailored to address their specific needs and to encourage cellular usage 
in general  because our customers typically live in rural areas  they are more likely to purchase plans that provide a regional footprint rather than a national one 
most of our service plans have a fixed monthly access fee  which includes a specified number of minutes  and incremental fees for enhanced services 
as a result of our focus on marketing strategies as well as the upgrade of our networks to digital capability  we are able to offer our customers a wide array of services on an individual or bundled basis 
we believe these services  which include the following  stimulate demand for wireless usage and increase customer loyalty caller id allows a customer to see the phone number and name of the calling party before answering the call or after not answering a call 
short message service allows a customer to receive and send text messages or content messages 
numeric paging allows a caller to leave a phone number rather than a voice message 
visual message notification alerts a customer that a text or voice message has been received by displaying an icon on the customer s phone 
add a line allows an additional phone to be included on a single account for a flat fee  permitting a customer to share the service plan minutes 
voicemail allows a customer to receive and retrieve voicemail 
regional personal toll free number provides a customer with a regional personal toll free number  which encourages customers to distribute their cellular numbers and keep their telephones turned on to accept incoming calls 
nationwide calling option allows a customer to pay a flat fee for all long distance calls made from our service areas 
advanced g technology data services includes picture phones  brew and java service  e mail access  data cards  and internet accessibility 
in addition to tailoring our service plans based on features and minutes of use  we also offer our customers regional calling plans and roaming packages that allow our customers to pay home usage rates while traveling within specified regional zones  both within and outside of our cellular service areas 
we have also established preferred roaming contracts and developed system integration with adjacent cellular 
table of contents carriers  which permit our customers to receive automatic call delivery  call forwarding  toll free access to voicemail  and call hand off nationwide 
roaming we have roaming agreements in our markets with various national carriers and have nationwide roaming agreements including cingular  which is effective through december  t mobile  which is effective through december  and verizon  which is effective through december under most of our roaming agreements  the roaming yield per minute we receive from outcollect calling minutes  in addition to the cost per minute we pay for our customers incollect activity  declines over time 
we have structured our roaming agreements to enable us to provide expanded network access to our customers both regionally and nationally and provide roaming rates based upon factors such as network coverage  feature functionality  and number of customers 
on a pro forma basis  giving effect to the cingular acquisition of awe  a substantial portion of our roaming revenue has been derived from agreements with three national wireless providers  cingular  t mobile  and verizon wireless 
for the years ended december    and  cingular on a pro forma basis giving effect to its merger with awe  verizon wireless  and t mobile accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of our total outcollect roaming minutes 
for the years ended december    and  cingular on a pro forma basis giving effect to its merger with awe accounted for approximately   and of our total revenue 
under our agreements with cingular and verizon wireless  we are able to attain preferred roaming status by overlaying our existing northeast  northwest  and south networks with gsm gprs edge and our midwest region with cdma xrtt technology 
the gsm gprs edge overlays in our northeast and northwest networks and our cdma xrtt network in our midwest region are substantially completed 
our gsm gprs edge overlay in our south region is expected to be completed during the summer of wireless alliance has a roaming agreement with its joint venture partner t mobile 
customer equipment we currently sell handsets manufactured by audiovox corporation  ericsson  inc  kyocera corporation  lg electronics  inc  motorola  inc  and nokia telecommunications  inc and accessories manufactured by a number of sources 

table of contents distribution and sales we market our wireless products and services through direct sales distribution channels  which include company owned retail stores and account executives 
we also utilize indirect sales distribution channels  including independent sales agents 
all distribution channels are managed on a regional basis 
we believe that our decentralized sales distribution strategy contributes to our service offering success because our regions are able to tailor their respective programs to meet the needs of each local market 
our distribution channels include the following direct sales through o retail stores and kiosks that we operate and staff with our employees 
as of december   we had stores  primarily located in our more densely populated markets 
in addition  we had stand alone kiosks 
our retail locations help us establish our local presence and promote customer sales and service  o account executives who are our employees and focus on business and major account sales and service  o telesales  which are conducted by customer service representatives  internet  and toll free phone services  and indirect sales through independent sales agents 
our independent sales agents are established businesses in their communities and include retail electronics stores  farm implement dealers  automobile dealers  automotive parts suppliers  college and university bookstores  video and music stores  and local telephone companies 
most of the agents sell our services in conjunction with their principal business 
we provide cellular  digital  and paging equipment to the agents for sale or lease to customers  and the agents market our services utilizing a cooperative advertising program 
each region is responsible for recruiting  training  and supporting sales personnel for each distribution channel 
customer base at december   our customer base consisted of three types of customers postpaid  wholesale  and prepaid 
postpaid customers accounted for the largest portion of our customer base as of that date  at 
these customers pay a monthly access fee for a wireless service plan that generally includes a fixed number of minutes and certain service features 
in addition to the monthly access fee  these customers are typically billed in arrears for long distance charges  roaming charges  and minutes of use exceeding the rate plans 
our wholesale customers are similar to our postpaid customers in that they pay monthly fees to utilize our network and services  however  the customers are billed by a third party reseller  who has effectively resold our service to the end user customer 
we in turn bill the third party for the monthly usage of the end user 
wholesale customers accounted for of our total customer base as of december  our prepaid customers accounted for of our customer base as of december  customer service to provide consistent customer service in our service centers  we have implemented local monitoring and control systems and maintain customer service departments consisting of trained personnel who are aware of the needs of the customers in our local markets 
our customer service centers are located in alexandria  minnesota  bangor  maine  enterprise  alabama  and bend  oregon 
our customer service centers can be accessed hours a day  days a year  and are responsible for processing new service orders and service changes for existing customers and maintaining customer records 

table of contents service marks in  our midwest and northwest regions changed their brand name to unicel 
we now use the unicel brand  which we own  in all of our markets 
the following table summarizes the brand names we have used to market our services in our different regions in and brand name use as of december  region northeast unicel unicel midwest unicel cellular  unicel northwest unicel cellularone south unicel unicel network operations we develop and build our wireless service areas in response to customer demand by adding channels to existing cell sites  building new cell sites to increase coverage and capacity  and upgrading entire networks with advanced technology and services 
where appropriate  we also upgrade acquired properties to enable us to provide similar quality service over our entire network 
we expect to continue our wireless system expansion where necessary to add and retain customers  enhance customer usage on our systems  and increase roaming traffic 
we also enhance our systems through scalable network equipment  cell site splitting  cell site sectorization  and digital upgrades of our systems 
in addition to improving service quality  these enhancements generally provide improved network system performance and efficiency of operations 
our network consisted of cell sites as of december  technology as described below  beginning in late and throughout  we have been overlaying our networks with g technology 
g refers to wireless technology and capability usually associated with general packet radio services gprs  enhanced data rates for global evolution edge  and code division multiple access x radio transmission technology cdma xrtt 
technology regional deployment description cdma xrtt midwest region deployed in and and commercially launched in august cdma xrtt is an evolution of cdma technology and represents a step towards g technology and allows data transmission at approximately kilobits per second kbps 
gsm gprs northeast  northwest regions deployed in and commercially launched in january south region is expected to commercially launch during the summer of gsm gprs facilitates certain applications that have not previously been available over gsm networks due to the limitations in speed of circuit switched data and message length of the short message service 
dataspeeds of up to approximately kbps are expected 
edge northeast  northwest  and south regions are selectively being overlaid in through edge is an evolution of gprs technology and is a system designed to increase the speed of data transmission via cell phone  creating broadband capability 
edge technology data speeds are expected to be approximately kbps 

table of contents while these new networks typically can accommodate roaming traffic as individual sites come on line  we commercially introduce g services to our customers only when a sufficient number of cell sites within the region have been overlaid to provide relatively seamless g service 
commercial introduction of cdma xrtt services in our midwest region began in august  and commercial introduction of gsm gprs edge services in our northeast and northwest regions began in january in late  we began the gsm gprs edge overlay process in our south region and anticipate a commercial launch in the summer of our g technology networks utilize existing cellular and pcs spectrum 
at december   approximately of our cell sites incorporated g technology 
the customer transition to g technology networks will take into account the pace of national carrier g customer growth  our own anticipated growth of g technology services  the cost to migrate existing tdma customers to more expensive g technology handsets  and our desire to ultimately operate from a single network technology platform 
we believe that the majority of our customers will be using g handsets by the end of we anticipate maintaining existing tdma networks in our regions as long as it is financially desirable and replacement equipment is available 
using previously unbuilt pcs licenses that are adjacent to our traditional cellular footprint  we are expanding our network coverage through the following initiatives midwest region cdma network expansion into the adjacent markets of fargo and grand forks  north dakota  northeast region gsm network expansion into the adjacent market of lewiston auburn  maine  northeast region gsm network expansion into the adjacent lakes area region in east central new hampshire  and northwest region gsm network expansion in mid into the adjacent markets of lewiston moscow  idaho and madras  oregon 
we also have pcs networks in our midwest and northeast regions that satisfy fcc build out requirements and allow us to receive outcollect revenue from our national roaming partners and minimize our incollect cost from our existing customers using their phones in those areas 
we do not market our wireless service to residents of these areas 
build out conditions of pcs licenses all pcs licenses are granted for year terms conditioned upon timely compliance with the fcc s build out requirements 
pursuant to the fcc s build out requirements  all mhz broadband pcs licensees must construct facilities that offer coverage to one third of the licensed area s population within five years of obtaining the license and to two thirds of the licensed area s population within ten years  and all mhz broadband pcs licensees must construct facilities that offer coverage to at least one quarter of the population within five years or make a showing of substantial service within that five year period 
failure to comply with these build out requirements could result in license cancellation or revocation 
we are currently in compliance with the build out requirements of our pcs licenses 
wireless alliance wireless alliance operates a gsm network and at december   had cell sites using t mobile s switch 
licenses our reasons for building out our licenses can vary 
we build out many of our licenses primarily to market our wireless services directly to that region s population and to capture outcollect roaming minutes 
we build out other licenses to minimize incollect cost and capture outcollect roaming minutes while not marketing our services to that region s population 
in some cases  we have chosen not to build out licensed areas  reflecting lack of sufficient current financial incentive 

table of contents our total marketed service area served approximately  voice customers  excluding wholesale customers  as of december  throughout our regions  we have multiple licenses at different bandwidths covering similar service areas 
accordingly  pops in some service areas may be covered by more than one license and are not incremental to our marketed pops

the high degree of compatibility among different manufacturers models of handsets and network facilities equipment allows us to design  supply  and operate our systems without being dependent upon a single source of equipment 
historically  we have used network equipment manufactured by northern telecom  inc  lucent technologies inc  harris  inc  nokia telecommunications  inc  alcatel  ericsson  inc  and motorola  inc 
we also resell network equipment 

table of contents competition we compete against wireless carriers in each of our markets and also compete with a number of enhanced specialized mobile radio service providers 
we compete for customers based on numerous factors  including wireless system coverage and quality  service value equation minutes and features over price  local market presence  digital voice and features  customer service  distribution strength  and brand name recognition 
some competitors also market other services  such as landline local exchange and internet access service  with their wireless service offerings 
many of our competitors have been operating for a number of years  currently serve a substantial customer base  and have significantly greater financial  personnel  technical  marketing  sales  and distribution resources than we do

we also compete with national third party resellers including virgin mobile usa  llc and tracfone wireless  inc these resellers purchase bulk wireless services from wireless providers and resell through mass market retail outlets  including wal mart  target  radio shack  and best buy 
tracfone purchases bulk wireless services from rcc in selected markets 
continuing industry consolidation has resulted in an increased presence of regional and national wireless operators within our service areas 
more recently  some national wireless operators have begun to build small networks in more densely populated or well traveled portions of our service areas 
national advertising and promotional programs by national wireless operators run in our markets are a source of additional competitive and pricing pressures even though these operators may not provide service in those markets 

table of contents in the future  we expect to face increased competition from entities holding licenses for pcs spectrum not yet operating in our markets 
the fcc has issued licenses for both narrowband and broadband pcs  and six broadband licenses were issued in each of our cellular service areas 
under fcc rules  pcs license holders are allowed to disaggregate the spectrum covered by their license 
accordingly  we may face competition from additional providers of pcs if the fcc approves a disaggregation of spectrum for any pcs license in one of our service areas 
in addition  the omnibus budget reconciliation act of required  among other things  the allocation to commercial use of a portion of mhz of the spectrum currently reserved for government use 
some portion of this spectrum may be used to create new land mobile services or to expand existing land mobile services 
further  the fcc has auctioned or announced plans to auction licenses in the ghz spectrum and mhz spectrum that may be used for wireless communications that would compete with our services 
we may also face competition from our roaming partners if they decide to overbuild or acquire networks in our service areas 
many of our roaming partners are national carriers with greater financial resources and access to capital than we have 
we also compete to a lesser extent with resellers  landline telephone service providers  fixed wireless services  specialized mobile radio  private radio systems and satellite based telecommunications systems 
a reseller provides wireless services to customers but does not hold an fcc license and might not own facilities 
instead  the reseller buys blocks of wireless telephone numbers and capacity from a licensed carrier and resells service through its own distribution network to the public 
thus  a reseller is both a customer of a wireless licensee s service and also a competitor of that licensee 
several small resellers currently operate in our service areas 
cable companies are providing telecommunications services to the home  and of these  some carriers are providing local and long distance voice services using voice over internet protocol  or voip 
in particular circumstances  these carriers may be able to avoid payment of access charges to local exchange carriers for the use of their networks on long distance calls 
cost savings for these carriers could result in lower prices to customers and increased competition for wireless services 
the telecommunications industry is experiencing significant technological changes  as evidenced by the increasing pace of improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology  shorter cycles for new products and enhancements  and changes in consumer preferences and expectations 
accordingly  with the entry of new competitors and the development of new technologies  products  and services  competition in the wireless telecommunications industry has been dynamic and intense 
our ability to compete successfully is dependent  in part  on our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry 
our marketing and sales organization includes a group that carefully monitors and analyzes competitive products and service offerings  changes in consumer preferences  changes in demographic trends and economic conditions  and pricing strategies by competitors that could adversely affect our operations or present strategic opportunities 
we believe that we are strategically positioned to compete with other communications technologies that now exist 
continuing technological advances in telecommunications and fcc policies that encourage the development of new spectrum based technologies make it difficult  however  to predict the extent of future competition 

table of contents legislation and regulation the following summary of regulatory developments and legislation does not purport to describe all present and proposed federal  state  and local regulation and legislation affecting the telecommunications industry 
many existing federal  state  and local laws and regulations are currently the subject of judicial proceedings  legislative hearings  and administrative proposals that could change  in varying degrees  the manner in which the telecommunications industry operates 
neither the outcome of these proceedings nor their impact upon the telecommunications industry or us can be predicted 
overview our business is subject to varying degrees of federal  state  and local regulation 
the fcc has jurisdiction over all facilities of  and services offered by  wireless licensees such as us  to the extent those facilities are used to provide  originate  or terminate interstate or international communications 
the communications act of  as amended the communications act  preempts state and local regulation of the entry of  or the rates charged by  any provider of commercial mobile radio service cmrs  which includes our cellular service and broadband personal communications service 
otherwise  state and local regulatory commissions may exercise jurisdiction over most of the same facilities and services to the extent they are used to originate or terminate intrastate or intra major trading area communications and with respect to zoning and similar matters 
the manner in which we are regulated is subject to change in ways we cannot predict 
federal licensing of wireless systems geographic market area licenses 
cmrs providers operate under licenses granted by the fcc within a specified geographic market area 
for cellular systems  those market areas are typically metropolitan statistical areas msas or rural service areas rsas as defined by the fcc 
pcs systems are normally licensed within market areas known as major trading areas mtas or basic trading areas btas  although it is possible to obtain  and we currently hold  some pcs licenses that are for market areas smaller than an entire mta or bta  known as a partitioned area 
while the fcc has used an assortment of methods in the past to grant licenses  most if not all new cmrs licenses granted by the fcc are by auction 
the fcc determines the availability of licenses in particular frequency ranges  as well as the terms under which license auctions are conducted 
our ability to secure new licenses that could be used to introduce advanced third generation wireless services may depend upon our success in future fcc auctions 
for example  in the fcc is expected to auction and license megahertz of spectrum for third generation and advanced wireless services  specifying comparatively large geographic areas  known as regional economic area groups  for licensing of megahertz of the available spectrum 
construction and operation 
most cellular licensees  including rcc  have substantially constructed their systems and have license rights in their cellular geographic service areas that cut off rights of others to obtain licenses on the same frequencies in the same areas 
we do not need to perform additional construction under our cellular licenses to retain those licenses 
if we were to discontinue operation of a cellular system for a period of at least continuous days  our license for such area would be automatically forfeited 
however  we have no intention of allowing any discontinuance of service that may occur to last as long as continuous days 
in order to retain licenses  pcs licensees  including rcc  are required by the fcc s rules to construct facilities in the geographic areas authorized under their pcs licenses 
that construction must result in a signal level adequate to permit an offering of services to a certain percentage of the population covered by those licenses within specified periods  based on the date of the grant of the licenses 
our pcs licenses are subject to revocation or nonrenewal by the fcc  as are all similar licenses held by other companies  if these build out requirements are not satisfied in a timely manner 
build out requirements apply as to certain pcs 
table of contents licenses we have acquired from other entities 
we believe that our construction will progress at a pace that allows for timely compliance with the construction requirements 
because we hold pcs licenses  we must comply with fcc microwave relocation rules 
a block of spectrum licensed for pcs may be encumbered by a previously licensed microwave system 
in such a case  if the pcs licensee cannot avoid interference with the microwave system  the fcc requires the pcs licensee to provide six months advance notice that interference may occur upon simultaneous operation of the pcs and microwave facilities and direct the microwave licensee to cease operation or move to other  non interfering frequencies after such period of time 
a pcs licensee is also obligated to participate in cost sharing if a previous relocation of a microwave incumbent benefits more than one pcs licensee 
however  a pcs licensee will not trigger any new cost sharing obligations for sites activated april  or later  due to a scheduled termination of the fcc s cost sharing plan as of april  we believe that we are in compliance with applicable fcc microwave relocation and cost sharing rules 
cmrs providers also must satisfy a variety of fcc requirements relating to technical and reporting matters  including coordination of proposed frequency usage with adjacent systems in order to avoid electrical interference between adjacent systems 
the fcc also requires licensees to secure fcc consent to system modifications in specified instances 
entities such as rcc that own towers used for radio systems are subject to federal aviation administration and fcc regulations respecting the location  marking  lighting  and construction of towers and are subject to the requirements of the national environmental policy act  national historic preservation act  and other environmental statutes enforced by the fcc 
the fcc has also adopted guidelines and methods for evaluating human exposure to radio frequency emissions from radio equipment 
we believe that all wireless devices we currently provide to our customers  and all our radio systems on towers that we own or occupy  comply with these requirements  guidelines  and methods 
we use  among other facilities  common carrier point to point microwave facilities to connect cell sites and to link the cell sites to the main switching office 
these facilities are separately licensed by the fcc and are subject to regulation as to technical parameters  frequency protection  and service 
renewal of licenses 
near the conclusion of the generally ten year term of a spectrum license  a licensee must file an application for renewal of the license to obtain authority to operate for up to an additional ten year term 
an application for license renewal may be denied if the fcc determines that the renewal would not serve the public interest  convenience  or necessity 
the fcc also may revoke a license prior to the end of its term in extraordinary circumstances 
in addition  at license renewal time  other parties may file competing applications for the authorization 
the fcc has adopted specific standards stating renewal expectancy will be awarded to a spectrum licensee that has provided substantial service during its license term and has substantially complied with applicable fcc rules and policies and the communications act 
if the fcc awards the licensee a renewal expectancy  its license renewal application generally is granted and the competing applications are dismissed 
although we are unaware of any circumstances that would prevent the approval of any future renewal application  no assurance can be given that the fcc will renew any of our licenses 
moreover  the fcc has the authority to restrict the operation of a licensed facility or revoke or modify licenses 
none of our licenses has ever been revoked or involuntarily modified 
assignment of licenses or transfer of control of licensees 
fcc licenses generally may be transferred and assigned  subject to specified limitations prescribed by the communications act and the fcc 
the fcc s prior approval is required for the assignment or transfer of control of a license for a wireless system 
before we can complete a purchase or sale  we must file appropriate applications with the fcc  and the public is by law granted a period of time  typically days  to oppose or comment on the proposed transaction 
in addition  the fcc has established transfer disclosure requirements that require licensees who assign or transfer control of a license acquired through an auction within the first three years of their license terms to file associated sale contracts  option agreements  management agreements  or other documents disclosing the total consideration that the licensee would receive in return for the transfer or assignment of its license 

table of contents in any instance where a proposed transaction would result in an entity holding attributable ownership interests in both the frequency block a and frequency block b cellular carriers in the same msa or rsa  the fcc conducts a case by case analysis of the potential effect upon competition and may disapprove of the transaction or issue approval subject to conditions that may or may not be acceptable to the parties 
non controlling minority interests in an entity that holds a fcc license generally may be bought or sold without fcc approval  subject to any applicable fcc notification requirements 
limitation on foreign ownership 
ownership of our capital stock by non us citizens is subject to limitations under the communications act and fcc regulations 
under existing law  no more than of a licensee s capital stock may be directly owned or voted by non us citizens or their representatives  by a foreign government or its representatives  or by a foreign corporation 
if an fcc licensee is controlled by another entity  up to of that entity s capital stock may be owned or voted by non us citizens or their representatives  by a foreign government or its representatives  or by a foreign corporation 
indirect foreign ownership above the level may be allowed should the fcc find such higher levels not inconsistent with the public interest 
regulatory matters and developments enhanced services 
cellular and pcs licensees must comply with the fcc s rules regarding emergency service 
there is a staged process for the required deployment of enhanced services  referred to by the fcc as phase i and phase ii 
under phase i  cellular and pcs licensees were required as of april   or within six months of a request from the designated public safety answering point psap  whichever is later  to be able to provide  if available to the serving carrier  the telephone number of the originator of a call and to provide to the designated psap the location of the cell site or base station receiving a call from any mobile handset accessing their systems through the use of automatic number identification and pseudo automatic number identification 
we are in substantial compliance with phase i requirements 
under phase ii  cellular and pcs licensees must be able to provide to the designated psap the location of all wireless callers  by longitude and latitude  in conformance with particular accuracy requirements 
to comply  licensees may elect either network based or mobile radio handset based location technologies and thereafter meet  according to a phased in schedule  the enhanced service standards stated in the fcc s rules 
we notified the fcc of our intention to utilize network based location technologies to provide phase ii enhanced service and amended the notification to indicate that  where we utilize cdma network technology  we will rely upon a handset based phase ii solution 
pursuant to terms and conditions of an fcc order to stay adopted in july  granting us an extension of the compliance deadlines  we are subject to requirements of the fcc where we have deployed a network based phase ii solution that we provide phase ii enhanced service to at least of a requesting psap s coverage area or population beginning march   or within six months of a psap request  whichever is later  and to of a requesting psap s coverage area or population by march  or within months of such a request  whichever is later 
we have received requests from psaps for deployment of phase ii enhanced service that relate to various areas where we provide cellular or pcs service and we have met the applicable coverage benchmark 
nevertheless  if the fcc finds that the accuracy results produced by any of our phase ii deployments are not in compliance with fcc rules  the fcc could issue enforcement orders and impose monetary forfeitures upon us 
the fcc has issued notices of apparent liability requiring other cmrs providers to pay fines based upon violations of enhanced service requirements 
the 
table of contents implementation of enhanced obligations may have a financial impact on us 
we are not yet able to predict the extent of that impact 
interconnection 
fcc rules provide that a local exchange carrier lec must provide cmrs providers interconnection within a reasonable time after it is requested  unless such interconnection is not technically feasible or economically reasonable  and that cmrs providers are entitled to compensation from lecs for terminating wireline to wireless traffic that originates and terminates within the same mta 
recently  the fcc decided to amend its rules so as to allow lecs to request interconnection agreements with cmrs providers that operate within the same mta 
as a result  lecs will be able to establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for termination of telecommunications traffic even when a cmrs provider has no need for direct interconnection with a lec that provides service in the same mta 
the fcc has a rulemaking proceeding in progress to consider whether  and possibly how  to replace the current system of reciprocal compensation for termination of local telecommunications traffic  and access charges for inter mta traffic  with a uniform intercarrier compensation plan 
that proceeding could result in changes to compensation arrangements we have with lecs and interexchange carriers for the exchange of telecommunications traffic 
additionally  although key provisions of fcc orders implementing the communications act s interconnection requirements have been affirmed by the courts  certain court challenges to the fcc rules are pending 
universal service 
the communications act mandates that telecommunications carriers  such as us  contribute to the federal usf  the purpose of which is to ensure that basic telephone services are available and affordable for all citizens and that consumers in rural areas have similar choices in telecommunications services as consumers living in urban areas 
the usf is intended to promote telecommunications infrastructure development in high cost areas and to provide subsidies to low income persons  schools  libraries  and rural health care providers 
we also are required to contribute to state universal service programs administered by some states 
the federal usf is administered jointly by the fcc  the fund administrator  and state regulatory authorities 
because we are a collection agent for customer contributions  we expect that our obligation to remit usf contributions will have a minimal financial impact on us 
amendments to the communications act allow wireless carriers such as us to propose services and pursue eligibility to receive usf funding for constructing  maintaining and improving our facilities and services in high cost areas 
when declared eligible for usf funding we are also obligated to offer discounts to low income customers  which amounts are reimbursed to us through the federal lifeline and link up programs 
we must be designated as an eligible telecommunications carrier etc by the state where we provide service or  in some cases  the fcc and the state or  in some cases  we must certify our eligibility to the fcc so that we may ultimately receive usf support 
we have received etc designation in the states of alabama  kansas  maine  minnesota  mississippi  oregon  vermont  and washington 
we are currently receiving usf support  or expect soon to begin receiving usf support  in each of these states 
we have filed additional applications for etc designation in new hampshire and south dakota 
to be eligible from year to year to receive usf support  our etc certifications must be renewed each year 
our ability to receive usf support  and our obligations to pay into state and federal universal service funds  are subject to change based upon pending regulatory proceedings  court challenges  and marketplace conditions 
local number portability 
the fcc has adopted rules on telephone number portability in an effort to achieve more efficient number utilization 
cellular and pcs licensees are required to provide number portability  which enables customers to change providers and services without changing their telephone number 
by november   cmrs providers in the top markets were required to offer number portability without impairment of quality  reliability  or convenience when customers switch wireless service providers  including the ability to support roaming throughout their networks 
providers in other markets were to comply by may  if they received a bona fide request to be open for porting out of customer numbers at least six months prior from another wireless service provider 
where our operations are subject to the fcc mandate we are in compliance 
in other areas any failure to comply with this obligation could result in a fine or revocation of our licenses 

table of contents in addition  the fcc provided guidance to the wireline and wireless industries in the form of a decision released november  in response to a petition filed by the cellular telecommunications internet association requesting that wireline carriers be required to allow their customers to retain their numbers when switching to a wireless carrier 
the fcc concluded that  as of november   upon the request of a customer  wireline carriers in the top markets must port numbers to wireless carriers where the wireless carrier s coverage area overlaps the geographic location of the rate center in which the customer s wireline number is provisioned  provided that the porting in carrier maintains the number s original rate center designation following the port 
the wireless coverage area was defined by the fcc as the area in which wireless service can be received from the wireless carrier 
wireline carriers outside the top markets were given until may  to comply with the same porting obligations 
the fcc subsequently granted an extension of time until may  to wireline carriers in the top markets that serve fewer than two percent of the nation s customer lines if such wireline carriers had not received a request for local number porting from either a wireline carrier prior to may   or a wireless carrier that has a point of interconnection or numbering resources in the rate center where the customer s wireline number is provisioned 
in addition  state public utility commissions have authority under the communications act to suspend or extend fcc number portability requirements faced by wireline carriers that serve fewer than two percent of the nation s customer lines 
on march   the us court of appeals  us circuit  issued decisions that upheld the fcc s requirements concerning wireline to wireless as well as wireless to wireless porting  although the court stayed the wireline to wireless obligations of certain lecs that qualify as small entities under the regulatory flexibility act until the fcc completes its final regulatory flexibility analysis and publishes it in accordance with the applicable federal statute 
meanwhile  the fcc invited and has received written comments on issues that bear upon wireless carriers obligations to port numbers to wireline carriers upon customer request 
we expect to face obligations that will allow our customers to port their numbers to wireline carriers 
calea 
telecommunications carriers also are subject to the communications assistance for law enforcement act calea  which is administered by the department of justice  federal bureau of investigation fbi and the fcc 
calea requires carriers to have a specific number of open ports available for law enforcement personnel with the appropriate legal authority to perform wiretaps on each carrier s network 
full implementation of calea s assistance capability requirements was previously required by june  however  because the fcc found that there was a lack of equipment available to meet these requirements  it accepted petitions for a two year extension of this deadline on a carrier by carrier basis 
we submitted such a petition and were granted a two year extension  until june   to comply with calea s assistance capability requirements 
we petitioned the fcc for another two year extension and received from the fbi a letter of support for our petition for extension 
at this time calea features are installed and operational at all but one of our switching facilities 
we have petitioned for additional time  through may   to complete final installation of calea features on a switch located in alexandria  minnesota 
additional requirements have been adopted to require cellular and pcs licensees to accommodate interception of digital packet mode telecommunications 
we will become obligated to comply with these requirements only if and when we commence to offer services that make use of digital packet mode technology 
if we are not able to comply with calea prior to the applicable deadlines  we could be subject to substantial fines that  under existing law  could be as much as  per day 
we cannot predict yet whether we will be able to comply with calea requirements prior to the applicable deadlines 
other fcc mandated payments 
we also are required to contribute annually to the telecommunications relay service fund and the north american numbering plan administration fund and to remit regulatory fees to the fcc with respect to our licenses and operations 
we do not expect that these financial obligations will have a material impact on us 
access by the disabled 
the fcc has adopted rules that determine the obligations of telecommunications carriers to make their services accessible to individuals with disabilities 
the rules require wireless and other providers to offer equipment and services that are accessible to and useable by persons with disabilities 
while the rules exempt telecommunications carriers from meeting general disability access requirements if these results are not readily achievable  it is not clear how the fcc will construe this exemption 
accordingly  the fcc occasionally adopts rules that may require us to make material changes 
table of contents to our network  product line  or services at our expense 
by september   we must begin to offer hearing aid compatible handsets  and by february   of all phone models offered must meet the u performance level for acoustic coupling to accommodate hearing aid compatible functions 
we are required to file with the fcc periodic progress reports on our preparation for implementing these offerings 
health and safety 
various media reports and plaintiffs attorneys in lawsuits not involving us have suggested that radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets may be linked to an assortment of health concerns  including cancer  and may interfere with some electronic medical devices  including hearing aids and pacemakers 
the fcc and foreign regulatory agencies have updated and may continue to update the guidelines and methods they use for evaluating radio frequency emissions from radio equipment  including wireless handsets 
in addition  interest groups have requested that the fcc investigate claims that wireless technologies pose health concerns and cause interference with airbags  hearing aids  and medical devices 
the fda has issued guidelines for the use of wireless phones by pacemaker wearers 
safety concerns have also been raised with respect to the use of wireless handsets while driving 
federal  state  and local legislation has been proposed and  in some instances  enacted in response to these issues 
concerns over radio frequency emissions may have the effect of discouraging the use of wireless handsets  and thus decrease demand for wireless products and services 
regulatory oversight 
the rapid growth and penetration of wireless services has prompted the interest of the fcc  state legislatures  and state public utility commissions to oversee certain practices by the wireless industry  generally in the form of efforts to regulate service quality  customer billing  termination of service arrangements  advertising  filing of informational tariffs  certification of operation  and other matters such as deterrence of spam messaging to wireless devices 
while the communications act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating the entry of  or the rates charged by  wireless carriers  a state has authority to regulate other terms and conditions of service offerings by cmrs providers and may petition the fcc to allow it to regulate the rates of cmrs providers 
several states have proposed or imposed consumer protection regulations on cmrs providers 
moreover  in securing etc status  we may become subject to such rules as we already are in maine and vermont  may be required to offer a specific universal service rate plan  as we have in maine  or may become subject to other state imposed requirements as a condition of their granting etc status 
in some states  we are or expect to be required annually to demonstrate that funds we collect from the high cost fund are used for the required purpose of constructing  maintaining  or improving our facilities and services 
these additional regulatory obligations can be expected to increase our costs of doing business 
the fcc has rules that require cmrs providers to report to the fcc network outages of at least minutes duration that potentially affect at least  user minutes 
we do not expect this requirement to have a substantial impact on our costs of operation 
on august  the fcc adopted a notice of proposed rulemaking to consider how the emergency alert system eas can become a more effective mechanism for warning the american public of an emergency 
the proceeding inquires whether eas should be extended beyond broadcast and cable tv to other services such as commercial wireless 
we may be obligated to purchase additional hardware and or software to comply with any eas requirements the fcc ultimately adopts that are applicable to wireless carriers 
at the local level  wireless facilities typically are subject to zoning and land use regulation and may be subject to fees for use of public rights of way 
although local and state governments cannot categorically prohibit the construction of wireless facilities in any community  or take actions that have the effect of prohibiting construction  securing state and local government approvals for new tower sites may become a more difficult and lengthy process 
the fcc has expanded the flexibility of cellular  pcs  and other cmrs providers to provide fixed as well as mobile services 
such fixed services include  but need not be limited to  wireless local loop services to apartment and office buildings and wireless backup services to private business exchanges and local area networks to be used in the event of interruptions due to weather or other emergencies 
the fcc has 
table of contents determined that fixed services provided as ancillary services to a carrier s mobile service will be regulated as commercial mobile radio services 
the fcc authorizes spectrum leasing for a variety of wireless services 
such rules may provide us with opportunities to expand our services into new areas  or provide us with access to additional spectrum  without need for us to purchase licenses  but the same rules also have the potential to induce new competitors to enter our markets 
in addition  proceedings relating to human exposure to radio frequency emissions  the feasibility of making additional spectrum available for unlicensed devices  and the provision of spectrum based services in rural areas are pending before the fcc 
all of these initiatives could have an effect on the way we do business and the spectrum that is available to us and our competitors 
the fcc does not currently specify the rates cmrs carriers may charge for their services  nor does it require the filing of tariffs for wireless operations 
however  the fcc has the authority to regulate the rates  terms  and conditions under which we provide service because cmrs carriers are statutorily considered to be common carriers and thus are required to charge just and reasonable rates and are not allowed to engage in unreasonable discrimination 
the fcc has adopted rules and has proposed further rules relating to the use of customer proprietary network information cpni 
petitions for reconsideration of the cpni rules are pending before the fcc 
additionally  the fcc has adopted rules governing billing practices 
while none of these existing requirements has a material impact on our operations  there is no assurance that future regulatory changes will not materially impact us 
the fcc has ruled that the communications act does not preempt state damages claims as a matter of law  but whether a specific damage award is prohibited would depend upon the facts of a particular case 
this ruling may affect the number of class action suits brought against cmrs providers and the amount of damages awarded by courts 
employees and sales agents as of december   we had  employees  including in sales and marketing  in customer service  in network and systems operations  in administration  and in finance and accounting

we own all the equipment within the leased sites 
the leases covering these sites have various expiration dates and are with numerous lessors 
these leases generally have renewal options that we would anticipate exercising 
due to our network design  loss of a leased location would not have a material impact on the operations of a region s business 
we have retail locations  of which almost all are leased 
the leases covering these locations have various expiration dates 
we believe that the loss of any one of these retail sites would not have a material impact on our business as we would likely be able to obtain substantially equivalent alternative space 
item legal proceedings we are involved from time to time in routine legal matters and other claims incidental to our business 
we believe that the resolution of such routine matters and other incidental claims  taking into account established reserves and insurance  will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we are a wireless communications service provider focusing primarily on rural markets in the united states 
our principal operating objective is to increase revenue and achieve profitability through increased penetration in existing wireless markets 
our operating regions include portions of five states in the northeast  three states in the northwest  four states in the midwest  and three states in the south 
within each of our four regions  we have deployed a strong local sales and customer service presence in the communities we serve 
our marketed networks covered a total population of approximately million pops and served approximately  voice customers as of december  we believe our market characteristics and network quality make us an attractive roaming partner for other wireless communications service providers 
we have preferred roaming relationships with cingular wireless  llc  t mobile  and verizon wireless in our various regions 
we began a g network overlay process in late  which we expect to be substantially complete in we are also pursuing a strategy of expanding our network coverage in all of our regions  which will  upon completion  increase our cell sites and our total marketed pops 
we believe our network overlay and expansion efforts will improve our ability to attract customers in addition to providing our roaming partners greater access to our networks 
operating revenue our revenue primarily consists of service  roaming  and equipment revenue  each of which is described below service revenue includes monthly access charges  charges for airtime used in excess of the time included in the service package purchased  long distance charges derived from calls placed by customers as well as wireless and paging equipment lease revenue 
also included are charges for features such as voicemail  call waiting  call forwarding  and incollect revenue  which consists of charges to our customers when they use their wireless phones in other wireless markets 
we do not charge installation or connection fees 
we also include in service revenue the usf support funding that we receive as a result of our etc status in certain states in addition to usf pass through fees we charge our customers 
roaming revenue includes only outcollect revenue  which we receive when other wireless providers customers use our network 
equipment revenue includes sales of wireless and paging equipment and accessories to customers  network equipment reselling  and customer activation fees 

table of contents operating expenses our operating expenses include network costs  cost of equipment sales  selling  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and amortization  each of which is described below network costs include switching and transport expenses and expenses associated with the maintenance and operation of our wireless network facilities  including salaries for employees involved in network operations  site costs  charges from other service providers for resold minutes  and the expense associated with incollect revenue 
cost of equipment sales includes costs associated with telephone equipment and accessories sold to customers 
in recent years  we and other wireless providers have increased the use of discounts on phone equipment as competition between service providers has intensified 
as a result  we have incurred  and expect to continue to incur  losses on equipment sales per gross additional customer 
we expect to continue these discounts and promotions because we believe they will increase the number of our wireless customers and  consequently  increase service revenue 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include salaries  benefits  and operating expenses such as marketing  commissions  customer support  accounting  administration  and billing 
we also include in sg a contributions payable to the usf 
depreciation and amortization represents the costs associated with the depreciation of fixed assets and the amortization of customer lists 
under the rules of sfas no 
 rcc treats licenses and goodwill as having indefinite useful lives and  therefore  since january   they are not being amortized 
depreciation and amortization also includes the depreciation of the capitalized cost of handsets leased to customers 
other expenses interest expense primarily results from borrowings under our credit agreement and the issuance of outstanding notes and exchangeable preferred stock  the proceeds of which were used to finance acquisitions  repay other borrowings  and further develop our wireless network 
interest expense includes the following interest expense on our credit agreement  senior secured notes  senior notes  and senior subordinated notes  amortization of debt issuance costs  early extinguishment of debt issuance cost  dividends on senior and junior exchangeable preferred stock subsequent to adoption of sfas no 
on july   related amortization of stock issuance costs subsequent to adoption of sfas no 
on july   gain loss on derivative instruments  and gains on repurchase of preferred stock 
all of our derivative financial instruments entered into after january  are marked to market  with changes in fair value included in interest expense 
preferred stock dividends are accrued on our outstanding class m convertible preferred stock and class t convertible preferred stock 
through june   preferred stock dividends also included dividends on our senior and junior exchangeable preferred securities 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue  expenses  assets  and liabilities during the periods reported 
estimates are used when accounting for certain items such as unbilled revenue  allowance for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization periods  income taxes  valuation of intangible assets  and litigation contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience  where applicable  and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets we review goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment based on the requirements of sfas no 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of october st or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances would include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors 
in analyzing goodwill for potential impairment  we use projections of future cash flows from the reporting units 
these projections are based on our view of growth rates  anticipated future economic conditions  the appropriate discount rates relative to risk  and estimates of residual values 
we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
if changes in growth rates  future economic conditions  discount rates  or estimates of residual values were to occur  goodwill may become impaired 
additionally  impairment tests for indefinite lived intangible assets  consisting of fcc licenses  are required to be performed on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the asset might be impaired 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 unit of accounting for testing of impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets eitf no 
 impairment tests for fcc licenses are performed on an aggregate basis by reporting unit 
we utilize a fair value approach  incorporating discounted cash flows  to complete the test 
this approach determines the fair value of the fcc licenses  using start up model assumptions and  accordingly  incorporates cash flow assumptions regarding the investment in a network  the development of distribution channels  and other inputs for making the business operational 
these inputs are included in determining free cash flows of the reporting unit  using assumptions of weighted average costs of capital and the long term rate of growth for our reporting unit 
we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
if any of the assumptions were to change  our fcc licenses may become impaired 
following adoption of sfas no 
on january   we completed a transitional impairment test for both our goodwill and licenses and determined that there were impairments of million and million  respectively 
we used a fair value approach  using primarily discounted cash flows  to complete the transitional impairment tests 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the impairment charges were recorded as a cumulative change in accounting principle in our consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of no additional impairment was found on the october  assessment date 
under sfas no 
 we performed annual impairment tests in and for our indefinite lived assets 
based on these tests  we recorded a noncash impairment charge of million included in operating expenses in the fourth quarter of there was no impairment charge in related to our annual assessment under sfas no 

table of contents revenue recognition service we recognize service revenue based upon contracted service fees and minutes of use processed 
as a result of our billing cycle cut off times  we are required to make estimates for service revenue earned  but not yet billed  at the end of each month 
these estimates are based primarily upon historical minutes of use processed 
we follow this method since reasonable  dependable estimates of the revenue can be made 
actual billing cycle results and related revenue may vary from the results estimated at the end of each quarter  depending on customer usage and rate plan mix 
for customers who prepay their monthly access fees  we match the recognition of service revenue to their corresponding usage 
revenues are net of credits and adjustments for service 
we adopted eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf no 
 effective july   on a prospective basis 
the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we receive usf revenue reflecting our etc status in certain states 
we recognize support revenue depending on the level of its collection experience in each etc qualified state 
where we do not have adequate experience to determine the time required for reimbursement  we recognize revenue upon cash receipt 
where we do have adequate experience as to the amount and timing of the receipt of these funds  we recognize revenue on an accrual basis 
we include the pass through fees we collect from customers as service revenue with a corresponding charge to sg a expense 
these pass through fees  which we have the option of passing to our customers  include state and federal usf fees  together with city utility and state gross receipt taxes 
revenue recognition roaming revenue and incollect cost roaming revenue and incollect cost information is provided to us primarily through a third party centralized clearinghouse 
from the clearinghouse we receive monthly settlement data 
we base our accrual of roaming revenue and incollect expense on these clearinghouse reports 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of roaming revenue and incollect cost can be made based on these reports 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that will result from failure of our customers to pay amounts owed 
we base our estimates on the aging of our accounts receivable balances and our historical write off experience  net of recoveries 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  we may be required to maintain higher allowances 
depreciation of property and equipment we depreciate our wireless communications equipment using the straight line method over estimated useful lives 
we periodically review changes in our technology and industry conditions  asset retirement activity  and salvage to determine adjustments to estimated remaining useful lives and depreciation rates 
total depreciation expense for the years ended december    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
effective january   we implemented the results of a review of the estimated service lives of our remaining tdma network assets 
useful lives were shortened to substantially depreciate all such equipment by december  during the fourth quarter of  we again reviewed the lives of the tdma assets and reduced the remaining useful life of this equipment to months 
as of december   all tdma equipment will be fully depreciated by june  the net book value of this equipment as of december   was approximately million 
while we will continue to sell and market tdma services for the foreseeable future  the amount of future cash flows to be derived from the tdma network assets is highly dependent upon the rate of transition of 
table of contents existing customers using tdma equipment to g capable equipment  as well as other competitive and technological factors 
we determined that a reduction in the useful lives of these assets was warranted based on the projected transition of network traffic 
we will continue to review the useful lives of the tdma assets throughout the period of transition to g capable equipment to determine whether further changes are warranted 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives  for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
in analyzing potential impairment  we use projections of future undiscounted cash flows from the assets 
these projections are based on our view of growth rates for the related business  anticipated future economic conditions  the appropriate discount rates relative to risk  and estimates of residual values 
we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
if changes in growth rates  future economic conditions  discount rates  or estimates of residual values were to occur  long lived assets may become impaired 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we increase or decrease the valuation allowance in a period  we must include an expense or benefit within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
as of december   our valuation allowance was million due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize the deferred tax assets 
the deferred tax assets consist principally of certain net operating losses nols being carried forward  as well as impairment write downs of intangible assets not currently deductible for tax purposes 
the valuation allowance is based on our historical operations projected forward and our estimate of future taxable income and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
it is possible that we could be profitable in the future at levels that cause us to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize a portion or all of the nol carryforward 
upon reaching such a conclusion  we would immediately record the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset at that time and would then provide for income taxes at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rates  which would be approximately under current tax law 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause the provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period  although our cash tax payments would likely remain unaffected until the benefit of the nols is utilized or the nols expire unused 
litigation and other loss contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are subject to litigation and other contingencies 
management must use its best judgment and estimates of probable outcomes when determining the impact of these contingencies 
we assess the impact of claims and litigation on a regular basis and update the assumptions and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents recently issued accounting pronouncements accounting for share based compensation on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

the amendments made by sfas no 
are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets  which requires that the accounting for the exchange be based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished  and replaced it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
the provisions in sfas no

service revenue growth for the year ended december  reflects usf support payments increasing to million as compared to million for the year ended december  we are currently receiving usf support in the states of alabama  kansas  maine  minnesota  mississippi  oregon  vermont  and washington 
we have filed additional applications for etc designation in new hampshire and south dakota 
we expect the amount of usf support in to be approximately million 
local service revenue per customer lsr increased to for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  contributing to the increase in lsr were increased levels of usf of approximately and increased access and features revenue of approximately reflecting fcc changes to the usf rate structure  our customer pass through charges were million during the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  service revenue was negatively impacted by a decrease in customers resulting from the awe property exchange completed on march  and customers lost due to the transition of our tdma networks to g technology 
customers 
our total customers decreased to  at december  as compared to  at december   primarily due to the transfer of approximately  oregon rsa customers to awe on march  as part of the property exchange  we received from awe operations in alabama and mississippi  including approximately  customers

table of contents during the year ended december   postpaid retention declined to as compared to in the year ended december  a primary contributor to the decline in retention was the transition stage of our networks from tdma to g technology throughout we believe tdma technology is not as attractive to customers as newer technologies 
accordingly  total customer net additions decreased to  in as compared to  in roaming revenue 
the decrease in roaming revenue during the year ended december  primarily reflects the effect of the transfer of our northwest region oregon oregon service area to awe on march  for the year ended december   the oregon service area provided approximately million of roaming revenue compared to approximately million for the year ended december  in addition  our outcollect yield for the year ended december  was per minute as compared to per minute in also impacting roaming revenue during the year ended december  was the accelerated transition by our national roaming partners to g technology handsets 
our most significant roaming partners are performing overlays of their existing networks with g technology at an accelerated pace 
we believe that during these partners converted their customer base to this new technology before we had completed our network overlays 
reflecting the transition of our networks and our roaming partners g technology customer base  we believe we did not capture a portion of available roaming revenue 
at december   approximately of our cell sites have been overlaid with g technology 
with our g networks substantially completed in our northeast and northwest regions as of january  three of our four regions are now overlaid with g network technology 
our south region may continue to lose roaming minutes until its upgrade is completed in late second quarter 
for the years ended december  and  cingular on a pro forma basis giving effect to its merger with awe  verizon wireless  and t mobile accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our total outcollect roaming minutes 
for the years ended december  and  cingular on a pro forma basis giving effect to its merger with awe accounted for approximately and of our total revenue 
our roaming agreements with cingular  t mobile  and verizon are effective through december  december  and december  respectively 
outcollect yields under these agreements will continue to decline over the terms of the agreements 
in certain markets  these decreases may be offset by increases in outcollect minutes 
under these agreements  we are able to attain preferred roaming status by overlaying our existing tdma networks with gsm gprs edge or cdma xrtt technologies 
our northeast  northwest  and south networks are being overlaid with gsm gprs edge technology  while our midwest region network is overlaid with cdma xrtt technology 
we expect to have these technology conversions substantially completed during we expect outcollect roaming yield for all of to be approximately

we completed a transitional impairment test in for both our goodwill and our licenses and determined that there were impairments of million and million  respectively 
rcc used a fair value approach  using primarily discounted cash flows  to complete the transitional impairment tests 
on a prospective basis  we are required to test both goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  including licenses  for impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach 
we performed our annual impairment test for both goodwill and licenses as of october  and using methodologies consistent with those applied under our transitional impairment tests performed as of january  and determined there was no additional impairment to be recognized 
other indefinite lived intangible assets will be tested between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
liquidity and capital resources we need cash primarily for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service  customer growth  and purchases of additional spectrum 
in past years  we have met these requirements through cash flow from operations  borrowings under our credit agreement  sales of common and preferred stock  and issuance of debt securities 
we began a g technology network overlay process in late  which we expect to be substantially complete in we are also pursuing a strategy of expanding our network coverage in all of our regions  which will result in an increase in the number of our cell sites and an increase in total marketed pops 
we believe our network overlay and expansion efforts will improve our ability to attract customers in addition to providing our roaming partners greater access to our networks 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  were approximately million compared to approximately million for the year ended december   reflecting the continued expansion of our existing wireless coverage and the implementation of g network overlays in all of our markets
