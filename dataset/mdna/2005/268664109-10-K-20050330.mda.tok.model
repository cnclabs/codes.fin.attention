item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of emc insurance group inc and its subsidiaries financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
company overview emc insurance group inc  a percent owned subsidiary of employers mutual casualty company employers mutual  is an insurance holding company with operations in property and casualty insurance and reinsurance 
property and casualty insurance is the most significant segment  representing percent of consolidated premiums earned in for purposes of this discussion  the term company is used interchangeably to describe emc insurance group inc parent company only and emc insurance group inc 
and its subsidiaries 
employers mutual and all of its subsidiaries including the company and an affiliate are referred to as the emc insurance companies 
the company s four property and casualty insurance subsidiaries and two subsidiaries and an affiliate of employers mutual are parties to reinsurance pooling agreements with employers mutual collectively the pooling agreement 
under the terms of the pooling agreement  each company cedes to employers mutual all of its insurance business  with the exception of any voluntary reinsurance business assumed from nonaffiliated insurance companies  and assumes from employers mutual an amount equal to its participation in the pool 
all premiums  losses  settlement expenses and other underwriting and administrative expenses  excluding the voluntary reinsurance business assumed by employers mutual from nonaffiliated insurance companies  are prorated among the parties on the basis of participation in the pool 
the aggregate participation of the company s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries is percent 
employers mutual negotiates reinsurance agreements that provide protection to the pool and each of its participants  including protection against losses arising from catastrophic events 
operations of the pool give rise to inter company balances with employers mutual  which are settled on a quarterly basis 
the investment and income tax activities of the pool participants are not subject to the pooling agreement 
effective december   the pooling agreement was amended to provide that employers mutual will make up any shortfall or difference resulting from an error in its systems and or computational processes that would otherwise result in the required restatement of the pool participants financial statements 
the purpose of the pooling agreement is to spread the risk of an exposure insured by any of the pool participants among all the companies 
the pooling agreement produces a more uniform and stable underwriting result from year to year for all companies in the pool than might be experienced individually 
in addition  each company benefits from the capacity of the entire pool  rather than being limited to policy exposures of a size commensurate with its own assets  and from the wide range of policy forms  lines of insurance written  rate filings and commission plans offered by each of the companies 
the company s reinsurance subsidiary assumes a percent quota share portion of employers mutual s assumed reinsurance business  exclusive of certain reinsurance contracts 
this includes all premiums and related losses and settlement expenses of this business  subject to a maximum loss of  per event 
the reinsurance subsidiary does not directly reinsure any of the insurance business written by employers mutual  however  the reinsurance subsidiary assumes reinsurance business from the mutual reinsurance bureau pool and this pool provides a very small amount of reinsurance protection to the emc insurance companies 
as a result  the reinsurance subsidiary s assumed exposures include a very small portion of the emc insurance companies direct business  after ceded reinsurance protections purchased by the mutual reinsurance bureau pool are applied 
in addition  reinsurance subsidiary does not reinsure any involuntary facility or pool business that employers mutual assumes pursuant to state law 
operations of the quota share agreement give rise to inter company balances with employers mutual  which are settled on a quarterly basis 
the investment and income tax activities of the reinsurance subsidiary are not subject to the quota share agreement 
the reinsurance subsidiary pays an annual override commission to employers mutual in connection with the  cap on losses assumed per event 
the override commission rate is charged at percent of written premiums 
the reinsurance subsidiary also pays for percent of the outside reinsurance protection employers mutual purchases to protect itself from catastrophic losses on the assumed reinsurance business  excluding reinstatement premiums 
this cost is recorded as a reduction to the premiums received by the reinsurance subsidiary 
changes for on october   the company successfully completed a follow on stock offering and sold million new shares of its common stock to the public at a price of per share 
employers mutual participated in the stock offering as a selling shareholder and sold million shares of the company s common stock that it previously owned 
as a result of these transactions  employers mutual s ownership of the company was reduced from approximately percent to percent 
net proceeds from the follow on stock offering totaled  these proceeds were contributed to three of the company s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries in late december to support a planned percentage point increase in the company s aggregate participation in the pooling agreement effective january  as a result of this change  the company s aggregate participation in the pooling agreement will increase from the current percent to percent and employers mutual s participation will decrease from the current percent to percent 
in connection with this change in the pooling agreement  the company s liabilities will increase  and assets will increase  the company will reimburse employers mutual  for expenses that were incurred to generate the additional business assumed by the company  but this expense will be offset by an increase in deferred policy acquisition costs 
the company will also receive  in interest income from employers mutual as the actual cash transfer did not occur until february  in addition to changing the individual pool participation percentages of employers mutual and three of the company s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries  the pooling agreement has been amended effective january  to comply with certain conditions established by the iowa insurance department and am best company 
these amendments provide for a fixed term of three years commencing january  and continuing until december   during which period the pooling agreement may not be terminated and the revised participation interests will not be further amended  absent the occurrence of a material event not in the ordinary course of business that could reasonably be expected to impact the appropriateness of the participation interests in the pool  provide that if a pool participant becomes insolvent  or is otherwise subject to liquidation or receivership proceedings  each of the other participants will  on a pro rata basis  adjust their assumed portions of the pool liabilities in order to assume in full the liabilities of the impaired participant  subject to compliance with all regulatory requirements applicable to such adjustment under the laws of all states in which the participants are domiciled  clarify that all development on prior years outstanding losses and settlement expenses of the participants will remain in the pool and be pro rated pursuant to the pooling agreement  and clarify that all liabilities incurred prior to a participant withdrawing from the pool  and associated with such withdrawing participant  shall remain a part of the pool and subject to the pooling agreement 
as a result of the planned change in aggregate pool participation  the reinsurance segment will have slightly less impact on the company s financial results in and beyond 
for example  the reinsurance segment represented approximately percent of total premiums earned in had the new percent aggregate pool participation been in effect in  the reinsurance segment would have represented approximately percent of total premiums earned 
the successful completion of the follow on stock offering will result in the company surpassing the securities and exchange commission s market value threshold for determination of accelerated filer status when the test is performed at june  as a result  the company will become subject to accelerated filing deadlines beginning with the december  annual report on form k 
industry overview an insurance company s underwriting results reflect the profitability of its insurance operations  excluding investment income 
underwriting results are calculated by subtracting losses and expenses incurred from premiums earned 
an underwriting profit indicates that a sufficient amount of premium income was received to cover the risks insured 
an underwriting loss indicates that premium income was not adequate 
the combined ratio is a measure utilized by insurance companies to gauge underwriting profitability and is calculated by dividing losses and expenses incurred by premiums earned 
a number less than generally indicates an underwriting gain  a number greater than generally indicates an underwriting loss 
insurance pricing has historically been cyclical in nature 
periods of excess capital and increased competition encourage price cutting and liberal underwriting practices referred to as a soft market as insurance companies compete for market share  while attempting to cover the inevitable underwriting losses from these actions with investment income 
as capital decreases and competition begins to subside in the interest of strengthening the balance sheet  premium pricing rises  sometimes dramatically  and underwriting practices are tightened referred to as a hard market 
during the late s the insurance industry had hit the depths of an extremely long soft market 
high interest rates and a strong stock market allowed insurers to cover ever growing underwriting losses with investment income 
as the year approached  declining interest rates and a weakening stock market prompted the insurance industry to begin a movement toward increased pricing 
this movement was dramatically accelerated by the terrorist attacks of september   pushing the industry toward a hard market 
the ensuing plunge in the stock market  a further decline in interest rates  high profile bankruptcies and rising concerns about reserve deficiencies lead the insurance industry to implement large premium rate increases in an effort to improve capitalization 
this hard market continued through  but began to level off somewhat during as premium rate increases slowed  or even flattened  in most lines of business 
premium rates were fairly stable during  but moderated slightly in certain lines of business and select territories due to an increase in price competition 
overall premium rate levels for are expected to remain steady or decline slightly due to improved industry capitalization and continued price competition 
a substantial determinant of an insurance company s underwriting results is its loss and settlement expense reserving 
insurance companies must estimate the amount of losses and settlement expenses that will ultimately be paid to settle claims that have occurred to date loss and settlement expense reserves 
this estimation process is inherently subjective with the possibility of widely varying results  particularly for certain highly volatile types of claims asbestos  environmental  and various casualty exposures  such as products liability  where the loss amount and the parties responsible are difficult to determine 
during a soft market  inadequate premium rates put pressure on insurance companies to under estimate their loss and settlement expense reserves in order to show a profit 
correspondingly  inadequate reserves play an integral part in bringing about a hard market  because increased profitability from higher premium rate levels can be used to strengthen an insurance company s loss and settlement expense reserves 
despite large reserve strengthening actions taken by the insurance industry during and  there continues to be concern about the magnitude of potential reserve deficiencies  particularly for asbestos and pollution exposures 
insurance companies collect cash in the form of insurance premiums and pay out cash in the form of loss and settlement expense payments 
additional cash outflows occur through the payment of acquisition and underwriting costs such as commissions  premium taxes  salaries and general overhead 
during the loss settlement period  which varies by line of business and by the circumstances surrounding each claim and may cover several years  insurance companies invest the cash premiums and earn interest and dividend income 
this investment income supplements underwriting results and contributes to net earnings 
the weakening economy during the period through prompted the federal reserve bank to reduce interest rates several times  to the point of historic lows 
as a result  called and matured fixed maturity securities have been reissued at much lower interest rates  which has had a negative impact on the insurance industry s investment income 
interest rates generally trended upward in  but are still significantly lower than historic levels 
recent actions by new york attorney general eliot spitzer have raised questions concerning the use of contingent commission arrangements whereby insurance companies provide agents with financial incentives in addition to the traditional commission structure 
the arrangements targeted by attorney general spitzer are variously referred to as placement service agreements or market service agreements and  in essence  compensate an agent for directing business to a particular insurance company 
the company  like many others in the insurance industry  uses contingent compensation arrangements to compensate independent agents for the valuable services they provide to their clients 
determination of the legality and propriety of the compensation arrangements targeted by attorney general spitzer will take time to resolve through the investigative and judicial processes 
the company intends to closely monitor these developments and will be diligent in reviewing and assessing its internal practices  as well as its contingent compensation arrangements  with a goal of ensuring that they are in compliance with all legal requirements 
attorney general spitzer has also alleged the use of bid rigging practices by some in the insurance industry 
bid rigging constitutes a violation of federal and state laws and is strictly prohibited by the company s code of corporate conduct 
the united states congress is currently studying  or has placed on their agenda  several issues of critical importance to the company and the insurance industry 
these issues include federal regulation on top of or in place of current state run regulation  tort and class action reform  extension for an additional year of the federal back stop for terrorism losses contained in tria  and asbestos liability determination and funding 
the company is closely monitoring activities by the united states congress on these issues through its membership in various trade organizations 
management issues and perspectives the insurance industry is highly regulated and very competitive  and its operations are impacted by many economic and social factors 
in order to be a viable source of insurance protection in today s marketplace  an insurance company must be strongly capitalized  carry a secure rating from am best company which is considered to be the leading insurance rating agency  and offer competitive products and excellent service 
management recognizes that insurance agents and their customers have many options to choose from when selecting an insurance carrier and continually emphasizes the need to meet and exceed their expectations in these areas 
management has long recognized the importance of adequate capitalization for its insurance subsidiaries and has strived to maintain a strong capital position by investing their assets conservatively and  more importantly  maintaining a consistent level of loss and settlement expense reserve adequacy 
carried reserves are analyzed on a regular basis and adjustments  if necessary  are implemented on a timely basis 
this procedure not only assures a consistent level of reserve adequacy  it also minimizes the impact that any required adjustment will have on current operations 
this dedication to reserve adequacy was demonstrated during and again during as the company strengthened loss and settlement reserves in the property and casualty insurance segment in response to the findings of regularly scheduled actuarial evaluations 
in addition to an ongoing review of claim files in the normal course of business  the company has for many years required each of its branch offices to perform a complete inventory of its open claim files during the fourth quarter of each year and to review the adequacy of each carried reserve based on current information 
this fourth quarter review process has not historically resulted in a significant increase in carried reserves  however  because of heightened emphasis placed on case reserve adequacy during  the review performed in the fourth quarter of generated a significant and unanticipated increase in carried reserves and a corresponding increase in settlement expense reserves 
in an effort to minimize the likelihood of this occurring in the future  beginning in the the branch offices will be required to perform a complete inventory and review of their open claim files semi annually rather than annually as previously required 
the first review is to be completed by the end of june and the second review is to be completed by the end of november each year 
this new procedure is designed to help assure that necessary reserve adjustments are implemented on a timely basis 
in addition to the recent actions taken to improve reserve adequacy  effective march   richard k 
schulz  a current employee of employers mutual  became the senior claims executive officer 
mr 
schulz has been the claims manager at the chicago branch office for the last five years and has over ten years of prior insurance industry experience 
mr 
schulz will report to william a 
murray  executive vice president and chief operating officer 
the participants in the emc insurance companies pooling agreement currently carry an a excellent rating from am best company 
management has worked diligently over the last several years to improve profitability through a combination of adequate pricing and focused underwriting practices 
maintaining a consistent level of profitability is a primary goal of management that will assist the company in its quest to achieve an even higher rating from am best company 
the products offered by an insurance company must be priced so that they are competitive in the marketplace  yet offer the prospect of producing an underwriting profit 
management is keenly aware of the need to achieve an underwriting profit in today s marketplace and has implemented focused underwriting initiatives that stress profitability over production 
achieving an underwriting profit has become increasingly important during the last several years as investment income  which is used to supplement underwriting results and contribute to net earnings  has been negatively impacted by the lingering low interest rate environment 
catastrophe and storm losses are unpredictable and can vary significantly from year to year 
management uses modeling software to help identify and estimate its potential loss exposure to a variety of events  both natural and manmade 
natural events that are modeled include hurricanes  tornados and windstorms  and earthquakes 
modeling activities for manmade events are primarily directed toward identifying concentrations of risk  such as workers compensation coverage for a business or property that is subject to a terrorist attack or other manmade event 
management purchases reinsurance protection to mitigate the company s loss potential to these types of exposures 
the company has completed the majority of the documentation of its work flow and internal controls over financial reporting as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of efforts during will focus on remediation of any identified gaps in existing controls  testing of the documented controls  remediation of any controls that are found to be not working as designed and the establishment of a maintenance process 
management expects to complete its evaluation of the company s internal controls over financial reporting by mid july  which will allow sufficient time for the company s independent auditors to perform their analysis and testing procedures and issue their audit report on the company s internal controls over financial reporting as of december  measurement of results the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states also known as gaap 
the company also prepares financial statements for each of its insurance subsidiaries based on statutory accounting principles that are filed with insurance regulatory authorities in the states in which they do business 
statutory accounting principles are designed to address the concerns of state regulators and stress the measurement of the insurer s ability to satisfy its obligations to its policyholders and creditors 
management evaluates the company s operations by monitoring key measures of growth and profitability 
management measures the company s growth by examining direct premiums written and  perhaps more importantly  premiums written assumed from affiliates 
management generally measures the company s operating results by examining the company s net income  return on equity  and the loss and settlement expense  acquisition expense and combined ratios 
the following provides further explanation of the key measures management uses to evaluate the company s results direct premiums written 
direct premiums written is the sum of the total policy premiums  net of cancellations  associated with policies underwritten and issued by the company s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries 
these direct premiums written are transferred to employers mutual under the terms of the pooling agreement and are reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements as premiums written ceded to affiliates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
premiums written assumed from affiliates 
premiums written assumed from affiliates reflects the company s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries percent aggregate participation interest in the total direct premiums written by all the participants in the pooling arrangement and the premiums written assumed by the company s reinsurance subsidiary from employers mutual under the quota share agreement 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
management uses premiums written assumed from affiliates and non affiliates  which excludes the impact of written premiums ceded to reinsurers  as a measure of the underlying growth of the company s insurance business from period to period 
net premiums written 
net premiums written is the sum of the premiums written assumed from affiliates plus premiums written assumed from non affiliates less premiums written ceded to non affiliates 
premiums written ceded to non affiliates is the portion of the company s direct and assumed premiums written that is transferred to reinsurers in accordance with the terms of the reinsurance contracts and based upon the risks they accept 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
management uses net premiums written to measure the amount of business retained after cessions to reinsurers 
loss and settlement expense ratio 
the loss and settlement expense ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of losses and settlement expenses to premiums earned and measures the underwriting profitability of a company s insurance business 
the loss and settlement expense ratio is generally measured on both a gross direct and assumed and net gross less ceded basis 
management uses the gross loss and settlement expense ratio as a measure of the company s overall underwriting profitability of the insurance business it writes and to assess the adequacy of the company s pricing 
the net loss and settlement expense ratio is meaningful in evaluating the company s financial results  which are net of ceded reinsurance  as reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
the loss and settlement expense ratios are generally calculated in the same way for gaap and statutory accounting purposes 
acquisition expense ratio 
the acquisition expense ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of net acquisition and other expenses to premiums earned and measures a company s operational efficiency in producing  underwriting and administering its insurance business 
for statutory accounting purposes  acquisition and other expenses of an insurance company exclude investment expenses 
there is no such industry definition for determining an acquisition expense ratio for gaap purposes 
as a result  management applies the statutory definition to calculate the company s acquisition expense ratio on a gaap basis 
the net acquisition expense ratio is meaningful in evaluating the company s financial results  which are net of ceded reinsurance  as reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
gaap combined ratio 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss and settlement expense ratio and the acquisition expense ratio and measures a company s overall underwriting profit 
if the combined ratio is at or above  an insurance company cannot be profitable without investment income and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient 
management uses the gaap combined ratio in evaluating the company s overall underwriting profitability and as a measure for comparison of the company s profitability relative to the profitability of its competitors who prepare gaap basis financial statements 
statutory combined ratio 
the statutory combined ratio is calculated in the same manner as the gaap combined ratio  but is based on results determined pursuant to statutory accounting rules and regulations 
the statutory trade combined ratio differs from the statutory combined ratio in that the acquisition expense ratio is based on net premiums written rather than premiums earned 
management uses the statutory trade combined ratio as a measure for comparison of the company s profitability relative to the profitability of its competitors  all of whom must file statutory basis financial statements with insurance regulatory authorities 
critical accounting policies the following accounting policies are considered by management to be critically important in the preparation and understanding of the company s financial statements and related disclosures 
the assumptions utilized in the application of these accounting policies are complex and require subjective judgment 
loss and settlement expense reserves processes and assumptions for establishing loss and settlement expense reserves liabilities for losses are based upon case basis estimates of reported losses and estimates of incurred but not reported ibnr losses 
for direct insurance business  the company s ibnr reserves are estimates of liability for accidents that have occurred  but have not yet been reported to the company 
for assumed reinsurance business  ibnr reserves are also used to record anticipated increases in reserves for claims that have previously been reported 
an estimate of the expected expenses to be incurred in the settlement of the claims provided for in the loss reserves is established as the liability for settlement expenses 
property and casualty insurance segment the company s claims department establishes case loss reserves for direct business 
branch claims personnel establish case reserves for individual claims  with mandatory home office claims department review of reserves that exceed a specified threshold 
this reserving process implicitly assumes a stable inflationary and legal environment 
the company s case loss reserve philosophy is exposure based and implicitly assumes a stable inflationary and legal environment 
when claims department personnel establish loss reserves they take into account various factors that influence the potential exposure  such as the types of injuries being claimed  whether the insured is a target defendant  the jurisdiction in which a potential court case would be litigated and negligence of other parties 
the goal of the claims department is to establish and maintain loss reserves that are sufficient  but not excessive 
most of the ibnr reserves for direct business are established through an actuarial analysis of ibnr claims that have emerged after the end of recent calendar years compared to the corresponding calendar year earned premiums adjusted for changes in rate level adequacy 
the methodology used in estimating these formula ibnr reserves assumes consistency in claims reporting patterns and immaterial changes in loss development patterns due to loss cost trends 
from this analysis  ibnr factors are derived for each line of business and are applied to the latest twelve months of earned premiums to generate the formula ibnr reserves 
ceded reserves are derived by applying the ceded contract terms to the direct reserves 
for excess of loss contracts excluding the catastrophe contract  this is accomplished by applying the ceded contract terms to the case reserves of the ceded claims 
for the catastrophe excess of loss contract  ceded reserves are calculated by applying the contract terms to both the aggregate case reserves on claims stemming from catastrophes and the estimate of ibnr reserves developed for each individual catastrophe 
for quota share contracts  ceded reserves are calculated as the quota share percentage multiplied by both case and ibnr reserves on the direct business 
the methodology used for reserving settlement expenses is based on an analysis of historical ratios of paid expenses to paid losses 
assumptions underlying this methodology include stability in the mix of business  consistent claims processing procedures  immaterial impact of loss cost trends on development patterns  and a consistent philosophy regarding the defense of lawsuits 
based on this actuarial analysis  factors are derived for each line of business  which are applied to loss reserves to generate the settlement expense reserves 
as of december   ibnr loss reserves accounted for  or percent  of the property and casualty insurance segment s total loss and settlement expense reserves  compared to  or percent at december  ibnr reserves are  by nature  less precise than case reserves 
a five percent change in ibnr reserves at december  would equate to a  change in loss reserves  which would represent percent of net income and percent of stockholders equity 
the company s direct ibnr reserves are established by applying factors to the latest twelve months premiums earned 
these factors are developed using a methodology that compares ibnr claims that have emerged after prior year ends to corresponding prior years premiums earned that have been adjusted to the current level of rate adequacy 
included in the rate adequacy adjustment is consideration of current frequency and severity trends compared to the trends underlying prior years calculations 
the selected trends are based on an analysis of industry and company loss data 
this methodology assumes that future emerged ibnr claims relative to ibnr claims that have emerged after prior year ends will reflect the change in frequency and severity trends underlying the rate adequacy adjustments 
if this projected relationship proves to be inaccurate  future ibnr claims may differ substantially from the estimated ibnr reserves 
following is a summary of the carried loss and settlement expense reserves for the property and casualty insurance segment at december  and december  settlement line of business case ibnr expense total in thousands commercial lines automobile     property     workers compensation     liability     bonds   total commercial lines     personal lines automobile     property     total personal lines     total property and casualty insurance segment     december  settlement line of business case ibnr expense total in thousands commercial lines automobile     property     workers compensation     liability     other  total commercial lines     personal lines automobile     property     total personal lines     total property and casualty insurance segment     internal actuarial evaluations of overall loss reserve levels are performed quarterly for all direct lines of business 
there is a certain amount of random variation in loss development patterns  which results in some uncertainty regarding projected ultimate losses  particularly for longer tail lines such as workers compensation  other liability and commercial auto liability 
therefore  the reasonability of the actuarial projections is regularly monitored through an examination of loss ratio and claims severity trends implied by these projections 
historically  individual case reserves established by the claims department have been adequate 
however  actuarial analyses performed during indicated that overall case reserves appeared to be somewhat inadequate 
this apparent inadequacy was driven by the workers compensation line of business  where adverse development more than offset the favorable development experienced on all other lines of business combined 
further analysis revealed that recent adverse development experienced in the workers compensation line of business was arising from both the indemnity and medical portion of the claims 
the underlying data indicated that the aggregate liability associated with time away from work was somewhat underestimated and that permanent injury awards were somewhat underestimated and or not anticipated when the reserves were established 
in response to these findings  the company established a bulk case reserve for the workers compensation line of business to supplement the individual case reserves 
an actuarial evaluation of case reserve adequacy is now performed each quarter  which resulted in additional increases in the bulk case reserve during to address the underlying cause of the indicated deficiency in case reserves  the home office claims department in early instructed each of the branch offices to review and carefully reevaluate all claim reserves for adequacy 
as a result of these reviews  case reserves were strengthened significantly in both the second and third quarters of and the third quarter actuarial review indicated that case reserves  as well as total loss and settlement expense reserves  were adequate 
however  during the required fourth quarter inventory and review process  the branch offices further strengthened their case reserves  generating a significant amount of adverse development on prior years reserves 
with this additional strengthening  carried loss and settlement expense reserves are toward the high end of the range of actuarial reserve indications at december  one of the variables impacting the estimation of ibnr reserves is the assumption that the vast majority of future construction defect losses will continue to occur in those states in which most construction defect claims have historically arisen 
since the vast majority of these losses have been confined to a relatively small number of states  which is consistent with industry experience  there is no provision in the ibnr reserve for a significant spread of construction defect claims to other states 
it is also assumed that various underwriting initiatives implemented in recent years will gradually mitigate the amount of construction defect losses experienced 
these initiatives include exclusionary endorsements  increased care regarding additional insured endorsements  a general reduction in the amount of contractor business written relative to the total commercial lines book of business and underwriting restrictions on the writing of residential contractors 
the estimation of the company s ibnr reserves also does not contemplate substantial losses from potential mass torts such as methyl tertiary butyl ether a gasoline additive that reduces emissions  but causes pollution  tobacco  silicosis  cell phones and lead 
further  consistent with general industry practice  the ibnr reserve for all liability lines does not provide for any significant retroactive expansion of coverage through judicial interpretation 
if these assumptions prove to be incorrect  ultimate paid amounts on emerged ibnr claims may differ substantially from the carried ibnr reserves 
as previously noted  the estimation of settlement expense reserves assumes a consistent claims department philosophy regarding the defense of lawsuits 
if the company should in the future take a more aggressive defense posture  defense costs would increase and it is likely that carried settlement expense reserves would be deficient 
however  such a change in philosophy could be expected to reduce losses  generating some offsetting redundancy in the loss reserves 
an important assumption underlying aggregate reserve estimation methods is that the claims inflation trends implicitly built into the loss and settlement expense development patterns will continue into the future 
to estimate the sensitivity of the estimated ultimate loss and settlement expense payments to an unexpected change in inflationary trends  the actuarial department derived expected payment patterns separately for each major line of business 
these patterns were applied to the december  loss and settlement expense reserves to generate estimated annual incremental loss and settlement expense payments for each subsequent calendar year 
then  for the purpose of sensitivity testing  an explicit annual inflationary trend of one percent was added to the inflationary trend that is implicitly embedded in the estimated payment pattern  and revised incremental loss and settlement expense payments were calculated 
this additional unexpected claims inflation trend could arise from a variety of sources including a general increase in economic inflation  social inflation and  especially for the workers compensation line of business  the introduction of new medical technologies and procedures  changes in the utilization of procedures and changes in life expectancy 
the estimated cumulative impact that this additional unexpected one percent increase in the inflationary trend would have on the company s results of operations over the lifetime of the underlying claims is shown below 
after tax line of business impact on earnings in thousands personal auto liability commercial auto liability auto physical damage workers compensation  other liability  property homeowners the property and casualty insurance companies have exposure to environmental and asbestos claims arising primarily from the other liability line of business 
this exposure is closely monitored by management  and the company has established ibnr reserves to cover estimated ultimate losses 
currently  asbestos reserves are based on the results of an independent consultant s ground up study of the company s asbestos exposures  which was completed in early environmental reserves are established with consideration to the implied three year survival ratio ratio of loss reserves to the three year average of loss payments 
estimation of ultimate liabilities for these exposures is unusually difficult due to unresolved issues such as whether coverage exists  the definition of an occurrence  the determination of ultimate damages and the allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties 
therefore  any estimation of these liabilities is subject to greater than normal variation and uncertainty  and ultimate payments for losses and settlement expenses for these exposures may differ significantly from the carried reserves 
reinsurance segment the reinsurance book of business is comprised of two major components 
the first is home office reinsurance assumed department horad  which is the reinsurance business that is underwritten by employers mutual 
the second is the mutual reinsurance bureau pool mrb  which is a voluntary reinsurance pool in which employers mutual participates with other unaffiliated insurers 
the primary actuarial methods used to project ultimate policy year losses on the assumed reinsurance business are paid development  incurred development and bornhuetter ferguson  a recognized actuarial methodology 
the assumptions underlying the various projection methods include stability in the mix of business  consistent claims processing procedures  immaterial impact of loss cost trends on development patterns  consistent case reserving practices and appropriate bornhuetter ferguson expected loss ratio selections 
for the horad component  employers mutual records the case and ibnr reserves reported by the ceding companies 
since many ceding companies in the horad book of business do not report ibnr reserves  employers mutual establishes a bulk ibnr reserve  which is based on an actuarial reserve analysis  to cover the lag in reporting 
for mrb  employers mutual records the case and ibnr reserves reported to it by the management of the pool  along with a relatively small ibnr reserve to cover a one month reporting lag 
to verify the adequacy of the reported reserves  an actuarial evaluation of mrb s reserves is performed at each year end 
settlement expense reserves for both the horad and mrb books of business are developed through the application of factors to carried loss reserves 
the factors are derived from an analysis of paid settlement expenses to paid losses 
the assumptions described for the property and casualty insurance segment also apply to the reinsurance segment settlement expense reserving process 
at december   the carried reserves for horad and mrb combined were in the upper quarter of the range of actuarial reserve indications 
this conservative selection reflects the fact that there are inherent uncertainties involved in establishing reserves for assumed reinsurance business 
such uncertainties include the fact that a reinsurance company generally has less knowledge than the ceding company about the underlying book of business and the ceding company s reserving practices 
because of these uncertainties  there is a risk that the reinsurance segment s reserves for losses and settlement expenses could prove to be inadequate  with a consequent adverse impact on the company s future earnings and stockholders equity 
at december   there was no backlog in the processing of assumed reinsurance information 
approximately  or percent of the reinsurance segment s carried reserves were reported by the ceding companies 
employers mutual receives loss reserve and paid loss data from the ceding companies on individual excess of loss business 
if a claim involves a single or small group of claimants  a summary of the loss and claim outlook is normally provided 
summarized data is provided for catastrophe claims and pro rata business  which is subject to closer review if inconsistencies are suspected 
unearned premiums are generally reported on pro rata accounts  but are usually calculated by employers mutual on excess of loss business 
carried reserves established in addition to those reported by the ceding companies totaled approximately  at december  since many ceding companies in the horad book of business do not report ibnr reserves  employers mutual establishes a bulk ibnr reserve to cover the lag in reporting 
for the few ceding companies that do report ibnr reserves  employers mutual carries them as reported 
these reported ibnr reserves are subtracted from the total ibnr reserve calculated by employers mutual s actuaries  with the difference carried as bulk ibnr reserves 
except for a small ibnr reserve established to cover a one month lag in reporting  the mrb ibnr reserve is established by the management of mrb 
employers mutual rarely records additional case reserves 
assumed reinsurance losses tend to be reported later than direct losses 
this lag is reflected in loss projection factors for assumed reinsurance that tend to be higher than for direct business 
the result is that assumed reinsurance ibnr reserves as a percentage of total reserves tend to be higher than for direct reserves 
ibnr reserves totaled  and  at december  and  respectively  and accounted for approximately and percent  respectively  of the reinsurance segment s total loss reserves 
ibnr reserves are  by nature  less precise than case reserves 
a five percent change in ibnr reserves at december  would equate to a  change in loss reserves  which would represent percent of net income and percent of stockholders equity

    to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information received from the ceding companies  the actuarial department carefully reviews the latest four horad policy years on a quarterly basis  and all policy years on an annual basis 
any significant departures from historical reporting patterns are brought to the attention of the reinsurance department staff  who check the bookings for accuracy and  if necessary  contact the ceding company or broker for clarification 
employers mutual s actuarial department annually reviews the mrb reserves for reasonableness 
these analyses use a variety of actuarial techniques  which are applied at a line of business level 
mrb staff supplies the reserve analysis data  which is verified for accuracy by employers mutual s actuaries 
this review process is replicated by certain other mrb member companies  using actuarial techniques they deem appropriate 
based on these reviews  employers mutual and the other mrb member companies have consistently found the mrb reserves to be appropriate 
for the horad book of business  paid and incurred loss development patterns for relatively short tail lines of business property and marine are based on data reported by the ceding companies 
employers mutual has determined that there is sufficient volume and stability in the reported losses to base projections of ultimate losses on these patterns 
for longer tail lines of business casualty  industry incurred development patterns are referenced due to the instability of development patterns based on reported historical losses 
for long tail lines of business  unreliable estimates of unreported losses can result from the application of loss projection factors to reported losses 
to some extent  this is also true for short tail lines of business in the early stages of a policy year s development 
therefore  in addition to loss based projections  we generate estimates of unreported losses based on earned premiums 
the latter estimates are sometimes more stable and reliable than projections based on losses 
disputes with ceding companies do not occur often 
employers mutual performs claims audits and reviews claim reports for accuracy  completeness and adequate reserving 
most reinsurance contracts contain arbitration clauses to resolve disputes  but such disputes are generally resolved without arbitration due to the long term and ongoing relationships that exist with those companies 
there were no matters in dispute at december  toxic tort primarily asbestos  environmental and other uncertain exposures toxic tort claims include those claims where the claimant seeks compensation for harm allegedly caused by exposure to a toxic substance or substance that increases the risk of contracting a serious disease  such as cancer 
typically the injury is caused by latent effects of direct or indirect exposure to a substance or combination of substances through absorption  contact  ingestion  inhalation  implantation or injection 
examples of toxic tort claims include injuries arising out of exposure to asbestos  silica  mold  drugs  carbon monoxide  chemicals or lead 
asbestos and environmental losses paid by the company have averaged only  per year over the past five years 
during  the company re evaluated the estimated ultimate loss projections for asbestos exposures 
based on this re evaluation  the company reallocated  of bulk ibnr reserves and  of settlement expense reserves to direct asbestos exposures 
in addition  the company diligently evaluated the adequacy of its asbestos reserves by commissioning a ground up study to better quantify its exposure to asbestos liabilities 
this study concluded that the company s exposure for direct asbestos claims ranged from  to  with a point estimate of  based on the results of this study  the company elected to increase the ibnr and settlement expense reserves carried for direct asbestos exposures by  at december   to  the study s results for asbestos exposures on assumed reinsurance business were received during  and the company elected to increase its ibnr reserves carried for assumed asbestos exposures by  to the study s point estimate 
the study and its results assume no improvement in the current asbestos litigation environment  however  continued efforts for federal legislation could reduce the ultimate loss projections for asbestos litigation below the levels currently projected for the industry 
since  the company has included an asbestos exclusion in liability policies issued for most lines of business 
the exclusion prohibits liability coverage for bodily injury  personal injury or property damage including any associated clean up obligations arising out of the installation  existence  removal or disposal of asbestos or any substance containing asbestos fibers 
therefore  the company s present asbestos exposures are primarily limited to commercial policies issued prior to at present  the company is defending approximately asbestos bodily injury lawsuits 
most of these defenses are subject to express reservation of rights based upon the lack of an injury within the company s policy periods because many asbestos lawsuits do not specifically allege dates of asbestos exposure or dates of injury 
the company s policyholders that have been named as defendants in these asbestos lawsuits are peripheral defendants who have had little or no exposure and are routinely dismissed from asbestos litigation with nominal or no payment at all ie  small contractors  insulators  electrical welding supply  furnace manufacturers  gasket  and building supply companies 
during  as a direct result of proposed federal legislation in the areas of asbestos and class action reform  the company was presented with several hundred additional lawsuits filed against three former policyholders representing approximately  claims related to exposure to asbestos or asbestos containing products 
these claims are based upon nonspecific asbestos exposure and nonspecific injuries 
as a result  management did not establish a significant amount of loss reserves associated with these claims 
the vast majority of the  claims are multi plaintiff suits filed in mississippi 
one lawsuit lists multiple named plaintiffs of approximately  individuals 
while the expense of handling these lawsuits is higher than what the company has averaged in the past  it is not proportional based upon the number of plaintiffs  and is mitigated to some extent through cost sharing agreements reached with other insurance companies 
the company believes its settlement expense reserve adequately accounts for these additional expenses 
the company has denied coverage to one of the former policyholders  representing approximately  claims  because of express asbestos exclusion language contained in the policy 
minimal expense payments have been made to date on the lawsuits related to the other two former policyholders and no payments have been made for either defense or indemnity 
four former policyholders and one current policyholder dominate the company s asbestos claims 
to date  actual losses paid have been minimal due to the plaintiffs failure to identify an asbestos containing product to which they were exposed that is associated with the company s policyholders 
defense costs  on the other hand  have typically increased due to the increased number of parties involved in the litigation and the length of time required to obtain a favorable judgment 
whenever possible  the company has participated in cost sharing agreements with other insurance companies to reduce overall asbestos claim expenses 
while proposed federal asbestos legislation was not successful in  plaintiffs attorneys have already altered their pleadings across the country to anticipate the enactment of federal legislation 
specifically  asbestos plaintiffs attorneys are pleading silica and pnuemoconisis dust exposure for new clients  as well as former asbestos plaintiffs 
the company is defending approximately such claims in texas and mississippi jurisdictions  some of which involve multiple plaintiffs 
the plaintiffs allege employment exposure to airborne respirable silica dust  causing serious and permanent lung injuries  ie  silicosis 
silicosis injuries are identified in the upper lobes of the lungs while asbestos injuries are localized in the lower lobes 
the plaintiffs in the silicosis lawsuits are sandblasters  gravel and concrete workers  ceramic workers and road construction workers 
all of these defenses are subject to express reservation of rights based upon the lack of an injury within the company s policy periods because many silica lawsuits  like asbestos lawsuits  do not specifically allege dates of exposure or dates of injury 
the company s policyholders a refractory product manufacturer  small local concrete and gravel companies and a concrete cutting machine manufacturer that have been named as defendants in these silica lawsuits have had little or no exposure and are routinely dismissed from silica litigation with nominal  or no  payment 
while the expense of handling these lawsuits is high  it is not proportional based upon the number of plaintiffs  and is mitigated to some extent through cost sharing agreements reached with other insurance companies 
in  the company developed  filed and attached pneumoconiosis dust exclusions in the majority of jurisdictions where such action was warranted 
mixed dust is defined as dust  or a mixture of dusts  composed of one or more of the following asbestos  silica  fiberglass  iron  tin  coal  cement  cadminium  carbon  mica  cobalt  barium  tungsten  kaolin  graphite  clay  ceramic  talc  vitallium  beryllium  zinc  cotton  hemp  flax or grain 
this exclusion precludes liability coverage for any injury  damage  expense  cost  loss  liability  defense or legal obligation arising out of  resulting from or in any way related to  in whole or in part mixed dust pneumoconiosis  pleural plaques  pleural effusion  mesothelioma  lung cancer  emphysema  bronchitis  tuberculosis or pleural thickening  or other pneumoconiosis related ailments such as arthritis  cancer other than lung  lupus  heart  kidney or gallbladder disease 
it is anticipated that this mixed dust exclusion will further limit the company s exposure in silica claims  and may be broad enough to limit exposure in other dust claims 
the company s environmental claims are defined as claims for bodily injury  personal injury  property damage  loss of use of property  diminution of property value  etc  allegedly due to contamination of air  and or contamination of surface soil or surface water  and or contamination of ground water  aquifers  wells  etc  or any all claims for remediation or clean up of hazardous waste sites by the united states environmental protection agency  or similar state and local environmental or government agencies  usually presented in conjunction with federal or local clean up statutes ie  cercla  rcra  etc examples include  but are not limited to chemical waste  hazardous waste treatment  storage and or disposal facilities  industrial waste disposal facilities  landfills  superfund sites  toxic waste spills  and underground storage tanks 
widespread use of pollution exclusions since in virtually all lines of business  except personal lines  has resulted in limited exposure to environmental claims 
absolute pollution exclusions have been used since the s 
the company s exposure to environmental claims is therefore limited primarily to accident years preceding the s 
the pre s exposures include municipality exposures for closed landfills  small commercial businesses involved with disposing waste at landfills or leaking underground storage tanks 
during  the company re evaluated the estimated ultimate losses for direct environmental exposures 
based on this re evaluation  the company reallocated  of bulk ibnr reserves and  of settlement expense reserves to direct environmental exposures 
no additional ibnr reserves were established for these exposures 
in  the company was presented with eight contamination claims filed against four of its petroleum marketers in iowa and indiana 
the claims arise out of alleged contamination of municipal public water systems by the gasoline additive methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe 
all mtbe lawsuits initiated in california  connecticut  florida  indiana  iowa  massachusetts  new hampshire  new jersey and new york were moved to their respective federal courts and were then transferred to the united states district court for the southern district of new york where they were consolidated under the caption  in re methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe products liability litigation 
the company is defending these claims under commercial auto policies which afford broadened pollution liability coverage for overfills 
these defenses are subject to express reservations of rights based upon the lack of property damage within the policy periods because these lawsuits do not specifically allege dates of property damage or contamination or any contamination that is the result of an overfill 
the company s exposure to asbestos and environmental claims through assumed reinsurance is very limited due to the fact that the company s reinsurance subsidiary entered into the reinsurance marketplace in the early s after much attention had already been brought to these issues 
the company took action to commute one reinsurance contract during the first quarter of that had some asbestos and environmental reserves associated with it 
at december   the company carried asbestos and environmental reserves for direct insurance and assumed reinsurance business totaling  which represents of total loss and settlement expense reserves 
the asbestos and environmental reserves include  of case reserves   of ibnr reserves and  of bulk settlement expense reserves 
the company s non asbestos direct product liability claims are considered to be highly uncertain exposures due to the many uncertainties inherent in determining the loss  and the significant periods of time that can elapse between the occurrence of the loss and the ultimate settlement of the claim 
the majority of the company s product liability claims arise from small to medium sized manufacturers  contractors  petroleum distributors  and mobile home and auto dealerships 
no specific claim trends are evident from the company s manufacturer policies  as the claims activity on these policies is generally isolated and can be severe 
specific product coverage is provided to the company s mobile home and auto dealership policyholders  and the claims from these policies tend to be relatively small 
certain construction defect claims are reported under product liability coverage 
during  of these claims were reported to the company 
the company s assumed casualty excess reinsurance is also considered to be a highly uncertain exposure due to the significant periods of time that can elapse during the settlement of the underlying claims and the fact that a reinsurance company generally has less knowledge than the ceding company about the underlying book of business and the ceding company s reserving practices 
the company attempts to account for this uncertainty by establishing bulk ibnr reserves  using conservative assumed treaty limits and  to a much lesser extent  booking of individual treaty ibnr if reported by the ceding company or establishing additional case reserves if the reported case reserves appear inadequate on an individual claim 
while the company s reinsurance subsidiary is predominantly a property reinsurer  it does write casualty excess business oriented mainly towards shorter tail casualty lines of coverage 
the company avoids reinsuring large company working layer casualty risks  and does not write risks with heavy product liability exposures  risks with obvious latent injury manifestation  medical malpractice  and for profit directors and officers coverage 
a small amount of casualty excess business on large companies is written  but generally on a clash basis only layers above the limits written for any individual policyholder 
the company has exposure to construction defect claims arising from general liability policies issued to contractors 
most of the company s construction defect claims are concentrated in a limited number of states  and the company has taken steps to mitigate this exposure 
construction defect is a highly uncertain exposure due to such issues as whether coverage exists  definition of an occurrence  determination of ultimate damages  and allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties 
the company has recently implemented additional coding to identify and monitor construction defect claims 
newly reported construction defect claims numbered   and in   and  respectively  and produced incurred losses and paid settlement expenses of approximately   and  in each respective period 
incurred losses and paid settlement expenses on all construction defect claims totaled approximately  in at year end  the company carried case reserves of approximately  on open construction defect claims

however  at each year end an actuarially determined range of estimates is developed for the major components of the loss and settlement expense reserves 
all reserves are reviewed  except for the involuntary workers compensation pools  for which reliance is placed on a reserve opinion received from the national council on compensation insurance certifying the reasonableness of those reserves 
shown below are the actuarially determined ranges of reserve estimates as of december   along with the carried reserves

during the loss settlement period  which may be many years  additional facts regarding individual claims become known  and accordingly  it often becomes necessary to refine and adjust the estimates of liability on a claim 
such changes in reserves for losses and settlement expenses are reflected in operating results in the year such changes are recorded 
during the three years ended december   the company has experienced adverse development in the provision for insured events of prior years 
the majority of this adverse development has come from the property and casualty insurance segment  primarily in the workers compensation and other liability lines of business 
following are the significant issues and trends that have been identified as contributors to this adverse development 
workers compensation claim severity has increased significantly over the past five years  with the projected ultimate average claim amount increasing approximately percent over the five year period 
an increase of this magnitude has made the establishment of adequate case reserves challenging 
a review of claim data indicates that claims adjusters have recently underestimated medical costs and the length of time injured workers are away from work 
in addition  partial disability benefits have been underestimated or unanticipated 
large increases in drug costs and the availability and utilization of new and costly medical procedures have contributed to rapidly escalating medical costs 
construction defect claims arising from general liability policies issued to contractors have contributed to adverse reserve development 
states with significant construction defect losses include alabama  arizona  california  colorado  nevada and texas 
large umbrella claims have recently contributed to the adverse development experienced in the other liability line of business 
a pattern of increasing umbrella claims severity is believed to be generally consistent with industry umbrella severity trends 
also contributing to overall umbrella reserve development is an increase in claims arising from underlying general liability policies 
legal expenses for the other liability line of business have also increased rapidly over the past three years  with defense costs increasing at an average rate of approximately percent per year 
this increase in legal expenses has occurred despite a reduction in the number of new lawsuits 
in response to an indicated deficiency in case reserves at december   the home office claims department in early instructed each of the branch offices to review and carefully reevaluate all claim reserves for adequacy 
as a result of these reviews  case reserves were strengthened in both the second and third quarters of however  during the required fourth quarter inventory and review process  the branch offices further strengthened their case reserves  generating a significant amount of adverse development on prior years reserves 
for detailed discussion of the factors influencing the adverse development on prior years reserves  see the discussion entitled loss and settlement expense reserves under the narrative description of business heading in the business section under item i of this form k 
deferred policy acquisition costs and related amortization deferred policy acquisition costs are used to match the expenses incurred in the production of insurance business to the income earned on this business 
this adjustment is necessary because statutory accounting principles require that expenses incurred in the production of insurance business be expensed immediately  while premium income is recognized ratably over the terms of the underlying insurance policies 
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs is calculated as the difference between the beginning and ending amounts of deferred policy acquisition costs plus the amount of costs deferred during the current year 
deferred policy acquisition costs and related amortization are calculated separately for the property and casualty insurance segment and the reinsurance segment 
the method followed in computing deferred policy acquisition costs limits the amount of such deferred costs to their estimated realizable value  which gives effect to the premium to be earned  related investment income  losses and settlement expenses and certain other costs expected to be incurred as the premium is earned 
deferred policy acquisition costs were not subject to limitation at december   and management does not anticipate future limitations to be likely due to the improved premium rate environment in both the insurance and reinsurance marketplaces 
deferred income taxes the realization of the deferred income tax asset is based upon projections that indicate that a sufficient amount of future taxable income will be earned to utilize the tax deductions that will reverse in the future 
these projections are based on the company s history of producing significant amounts of taxable income  the improved premium rate environment for both the property and casualty insurance segment and the reinsurance segment and loss and expense control initiatives that have been implemented in recent years 
in addition  management has formulated tax planning strategies that could be implemented to generate taxable income if needed 
should the projected taxable income and tax planning strategies not provide sufficient taxable income to recover the deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance would be required 
results of operations segment information and consolidated net income for the three years ended december  are as follows in thousands property and casualty insurance premiums earned    losses and settlement expenses    acquisition and other expenses    underwriting loss    loss and settlement expense ratio acquisition expense ratio combined ratio losses and settlement expenses insured events of current year    increase in provision for insured events of prior years    total losses and settlement expenses    catastrophe and storm losses    in thousands reinsurance premiums earned    losses and settlement expenses    acquisition and other expenses    underwriting income loss    loss and settlement expense ratio acquisition expense ratio combined ratio losses and settlement expenses insured events of current year    decrease increase in provision for insured events of prior years    total losses and settlement expenses    catastrophe and storm losses   consolidated revenues premiums earned    net investment income    realized investment gains losses    other income losses and expenses losses and settlement expenses    acquisition and other expenses    interest expense    other expense    income before income tax expense    income tax expense    net income    earnings per share loss and settlement expense ratio acquisition expense ratio combined ratio losses and settlement expenses insured events of current year    increase in provision for insured events of prior years    total losses and settlement expenses    catastrophe and storm losses    year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income decreased percent to  per share in from  per share in this decrease is attributed to a significant increase in the amount of adverse development experienced on prior years reserves 
the majority of this adverse development occurred during the fourth quarter and is attributed to a diligent review and reevaluation of the individual case reserves carried by the property and casualty insurance segment 
in addition to an ongoing review of claims files in the normal course of business  the company has for many years required each of its branch office to perform a complete inventory of its open claim files during the fourth quarter of each year and to review the adequacy of each carried reserve based on current information 
this review process has not historically resulted in a significant increase in case reserves  however  because of heightened emphasis placed on case reserve adequacy during  the review performed in the fourth quarter of generated a significant and unanticipated increase in carried reserves and a corresponding increase in settlement expense reserves 
catastrophe and storm losses declined percent in but remained at an unusually high level due to the four hurricanes that hit the southern united states in august and september 
to help assure that necessary case reserve adjustment are implemented on a timely basis in the future  beginning in the branch offices will be required to perform a complete inventory and review of their case reserves semi annually  rather than annually as previously required 
the first review is to be completed by the end of june and the second review is to be completed by the end of november each year 
the calculation of earning per share is impacted by the company s recently completed follow on stock offering in which million new shares of common stock were issued on october  the company earned approximately  of additional interest income on the net proceeds of the stock offering during the fourth quarter  however  this additional interest income was not sufficient to avoid an approximate percent dilution in the earnings per share calculation 
premium income premiums earned increased percent to  in from  in this increase is primarily attributed to rate increases implemented during the last few years in the property and casualty insurance business as well as moderate growth and improved pricing in the assumed reinsurance business 
the overall market for property and casualty insurance was stable during  but moderated slightly in certain lines of business and select territories due to an increase in price competition 
price competition is expected to increase for most lines of business in  but not to the extent seen in the last soft market 
the company will continue its efforts to maintain current pricing levels and will implement rate increases in those lines of business and or territories where such action is warranted  however  the overall impact of these rate increases will continue to dissipate as the increases become smaller and less frequent 
premiums earned for the property and casualty insurance segment increased percent to  in from  in this increase is primarily the result of rate increases that were implemented during the prior two years 
after the broad based rate increases implemented during the peak of the hard market in and  premium rate levels for most lines of business were considered to be at  or near  adequate levels at the end of accordingly  moderate and more targeted rate increases were implemented during and this fine tuning of the company s rate structure has been directed toward specific accounts  territories and lines of business where additional rate increases were warranted 
due to the timing of policy renewals and the earning of premiums ratably over the terms of the underlying policies  a time delay exists for implemented rate increases to have a noticeable impact on premiums earned 
during  premiums written increased only percent due to a decline in policy count and an increase in ceded premiums 
the decline in policy count is attributed to several factors  including the non renewal of existing business that was under priced and or under performing  a reluctance to accept new risks in under priced lines of business and a decrease in new business associated with a moderate increase in price competition 
the increase in ceded premiums primarily reflects an increase in the cost of the company s reinsurance programs 
premium rate levels for most lines of business are not expected to change significantly in in light of the improvements that have been achieved in both the pricing and the quality of the company s book of business  management has become more receptive to opportunities to write new business  but continues to stress profitability over production 
premiums earned for the reinsurance segment increased percent to  in from  in due to increased participation in the mrb reinsurance pool 
for  employers mutual s participation in the mrb reinsurance pool which is ceded to the reinsurance segment under the terms of the quota share agreement increased to percent from percent in  producing  of additional premiums earned 
the increase in the mrb premiums earned was partially offset by a decline in the horad book of business because employers mutual was unsuccessful in its attempt to renew several accounts during the january and july  renewal seasons due to its current a excellent am best rating 
employers mutual is attempting to replace this business with new accounts and increased participation on existing accounts 
following large across the board rate increases implemented in  premium rate increases on excess of loss contracts moderated during and due to the influx of new capital into the reinsurance marketplace  however  contracts with poor loss experience continued to receive large rate increases 
the rate increases implemented during the last several years have been realized in conjunction with moderate declines in the related exposure base due to increased retention levels and coverage exclusions for terrorist activities 
in addition  both excess of loss and pro rata contracts have benefited from improved industry wide rate levels at the primary company level 
premiums earned in reflect a decrease in the estimate of earned but not reported premiums of  compared to an increase of  in the board of directors of the mrb reinsurance pool  of which employers mutual is a member  recently authorized management to pursue the addition of one or two new assuming companies to the pool 
if additional assuming companies are added to the pool  employers mutual s participation would be reduced and the reinsurance segment s premium volume would decline in the short term  however  this action will strengthen mrb s surplus base and should favorably impact their ability to attract new business 
losses and settlement expenses losses and settlement expenses increased percent to  in from  in the loss and settlement expense ratio increased to percent in from percent in the increase in the ratio is primarily attributed to a significant amount of adverse development on prior years reserves in the property and casualty insurance segment  but was partially offset by a decline in reported losses in the reinsurance segment 
catastrophe and storm losses declined percent in  but remained at an unusually high level 
the loss and settlement expense ratio for the property and casualty insurance segment increased to percent in from percent in the increase in the ratio is primarily attributed to a significant increase in adverse development on prior years reserves 
the adverse development of reflects a combination of newly reported claims in excess of carried ibnr reserves  development on case reserves of previously reported claims  bulk reserve strengthening  and settlement expense reserve increases resulting from increases in case reserves 
this adverse development was partially offset by  of reinsurance recoveries associated with the case reserve development and ibnr emergence 
substantial case reserve strengthening performed at the branch offices  primarily in the workers compensation and other liability lines of business  is the underlying reason for the adverse reserve development that occurred during as discussed further under the critical accounting policies heading of this discussion  the economic factors behind this case reserve strengthening include  most notably  an increase in workers compensation claim severity  increases in construction defect claim activity  the recent occurrence of several large umbrella claims  and increasing legal expenses in the other liability line of business 
loss severity continued to trend upward during while overall loss frequency continued to trend downward  however  there are some indications that loss frequency may be leveling out 
catastrophe and storm losses for include  net of reinsurance from the four hurricanes that hit the southern united states in august and september 
the loss and settlement expense ratio for the reinsurance segment decreased to percent in from percent in  despite an increase in catastrophe and storm losses 
the decline in the ratio reflects a decrease in the ratio of reported losses to premiums earned for policy year business  an increase in favorable development on prior years reserves and continued improvement in overall premium rate adequacy 
the favorable development experienced in is attributed to reported policy year losses for property  casualty and multi line classes that are below implicit projections 
catastrophe and storm losses for include  associated with the four hurricanes that hit the southern united states in august and september 
the reinsurance segment had exposure to all four hurricanes and reached its  cap on losses assumed per occurrence on three of them 
during  two events midwest storms in the month of may and hurricane isabel reached the  cap 
acquisition and other expenses acquisition and other expenses increased percent to  in from  in the expense ratio acquisition and other expenses expressed as a percentage of premiums earned increased to percent in from percent in  primarily due to increases in contingent commission and policyholder dividend expenses 
for the property and casualty insurance segment  the acquisition expense ratio increased to percent in from percent in the rise in this ratio is primarily attributed to an increase in contingent commission expense from the company s agent profit share program and an increase in policyholder dividend expense 
the company will be implementing a new agent profit share program  which is designed to better equate agent compensation with the quality and quantity of the insurance business produced  effective january  under the new program  the company s best performing agents will be rewarded with increased compensation while agents with marginal business will experience a decline in compensation 
total profit share expense under the new program is expected to decline slightly 
the increase in contingent commission expense was partially offset by  of ceded contingent commission income recognized in the fourth quarter of related to a no claims bonus on the terrorism reinsurance contract for years and for the reinsurance segment  the acquisition expense ratio increased to percent in from percent in the increase is primarily attributed to a large amount of contingent commission expense reported by mrb during  but was reduced by a  increase in contingent commission income from a retrocession contract on the horad book of business 
both increases are a reflection of recent favorable underwriting performance 
the asset for deferred acquisitions costs increased in and in connection with the increased participation in the mrb pool 
these increases offset commission expense of  and  recorded for statutory purposes in those respective years with the increased participation in the mrb pool 
investment results net investment income remained relatively flat at  in compared to  in  despite an increase in invested assets 
this is primarily attributed to the lingering low interest rate environment  which has negatively impacted the rate of return earned on the company s investments 
during this prolonged period of low interest rates  many of the company s higher yielding securities have been called 
the proceeds from these called securities  and from maturing securities  have been reinvested at the current lower interest rates  resulting in less investment income 
in addition  until the second quarter of the company had been reluctant to invest in long term securities due to the low interest rate environment  and had therefore accumulated a significant amount of short term and cash equivalent investments 
since these investments carry lower interest rates than long term securities  the decline in the company s rate of return was magnified 
however  during the second quarter of interest rates became more attractive and the company began investing in long term securities 
the company reported net realized investment gains of  in and  in the large amount of realized investment gains in includes  of net gain recognized during the second quarter on the company s investment in mci communications corporation bonds in conjunction with a payout award received under a bankruptcy court approved plan of reorganization 
the mci bonds had previously been determined to be other than temporarily impaired during the second quarter of the new mci bonds were sold during the third quarter  resulting in an additional realized gain of  reflected in the gains of are  of other than temporary impairment losses recognized in the company s equity portfolio during the first quarter   of net losses recognized by the company s equity managers during the first quarter as they rebalanced the company s portfolios to enhance future returns  and  of losses recognized on the sale of american airlines and united airlines bonds during the first quarter 
these losses were more than offset by gains recognized on the sale of certain bond and equity investments during the remainder of the company has not recognized any additional other than temporary impairment losses since the first quarter of  and all the impaired equity securities were sold before year end  generating gross realized gains of  and gross realized losses of  other information income tax expense decreased percent to  in from  in the effective tax rate declined to percent in from percent in  primarily due to an increase in tax exempt investment income and a decline in pre tax income 
effective april   the company was included in employers mutual s consolidated tax return due to the fact that employers mutual attained percent ownership of the company at the end of march 
the company filed a short period tax return with its subsidiaries for the period january  through march  during october employers mutual s ownership of the company fell below percent upon successful completion of the follow on stock offering 
accordingly  the company will no longer be included in employers mutual s consolidated tax return effective october   and the company will file a short period tax return for the period october  through december  on december   the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act was signed into law 
the act expanded medicare to include  for the first time  coverage for prescription drugs 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued staff position fas no 
accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of because of various uncertainties  including employers mutual s response to this legislation and the appropriate accounting methodology for this event  the company elected to defer financial recognition of this legislation as permitted under fas in may  the fasb issued staff position fas no 
 which became effective for interim and annual periods beginning after june  fas no 
provides accounting guidance and disclosure requirements for the prescription drug subsidy established under the act 
the effect of the subsidy on the measurement of the employers mutual postretirement benefit plan resulted in a decrease in the accumulated projected benefit obligation of  and the net periodic postretirement benefit cost for was reduced by  adoption of fas resulted in a  reduction in the company s share of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost for employers mutual participated in the company s dividend reinvestment and common stock purchase plan during the first two quarters of and reinvested percent of its dividends in additional shares of the company s common stock 
due to its participation in the company s recent stock offering  employers mutual discontinued its participation in the plan for the third and fourth quarters of and has indicated that it will likely not participate in the plan in on november   president bush signed into law the terrorism risk insurance act of tria 
tria provides a temporary federal backstop on losses from certified terrorism events from foreign sources and is effective until december  coverage includes most direct commercial lines of business  including coverage for losses from nuclear  biological and chemical exposures 
each insurer has a deductible amount  which is calculated as a percentage of the prior year s direct earned commercial lines premium and a ten percent retention above the deductible 
the percentage used in the deductible calculation increased from seven percent in to ten percent in  and will increase to percent in tria caps losses at billion annually  no insurer that has met its deductible will be liable for payment of any portion above that amount 
congress is currently debating whether tria should be extended for one or possibly two years due to concerns that terrorism insurance may not be available in the private insurance market when tria expires  however  no action has yet been taken 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income increased percent to a record  per share in from  per share in this increase was attributed to improved premium rate adequacy  an improvement in the quality of the company s book of business and strong second half earnings in the reinsurance segment 
the improvement in net income was achieved even though the company experienced an unusually high level of catastrophe and storm losses and performed some necessary reserve strengthening in the property and casualty insurance segment 
premium income premiums earned increased percent to  in from  in this increase was attributed to rate increases that were implemented in the property and casualty insurance segment during the preceding two years as well as significant growth and improved pricing in the reinsurance segment 
the market for property and casualty insurance softened somewhat during but was considered to be firm at year end 
premiums earned for the property and casualty insurance segment increased percent to  in from  in  primarily as a result of rate increases that were implemented during the preceding three years 
the rate increases implemented in and were broad based in nature and resulted in premium rate levels for most lines of business that were considered to be at  or near  adequate levels at december  accordingly  moderate and more targeted rate increases were implemented during this fine tuning of the company s rate structure was directed toward specific accounts  territories and lines of business where additional rate increases were warranted 
due to the timing of policy renewals and the earning of premiums ratably over the terms of the underlying policies  a time delay exists for implemented rate increases to have a noticeable impact on premiums earned 
premiums earned for reflect this delay and continued to show strong growth as the rate increases obtained in became earned  however  the growth rate in was limited by a decline in policy count overall approximately percent from december  that resulted from a decrease in new business associated with a moderate increase in rate competition and a reluctance to accept new risks in under priced lines of business  and the non renewal of existing business that was under priced and or under performing 
premiums earned for the reinsurance segment increased percent to  in from  in  primarily as a result of improved premium rate levels and increased participation in the mrb reinsurance pool 
following the large across the board rate increases implemented in  premium rate increases on excess of loss contracts moderated in due to the influx of new capital into the reinsurance marketplace  however  contracts with poor loss experience continued to receive exceptionally large rate increases 
the rate increases implemented during and were realized in conjunction with moderate declines in the related exposure base due to increased retention levels and coverage exclusions for terrorist activities 
in addition  both excess of loss and pro rata contracts were benefiting from improved industry wide rate levels at the primary company level 
for  employers mutual s participation in the mrb reinsurance pool increased to percent from percent in  producing  of additional earned premium 
in addition to these factors  the growth in earned premiums for reflected an increase in the estimate of earned but not reported premiums of  compared to a decrease in this estimate of approximately  in losses and settlement expenses losses and settlement expenses increased percent to  in from  in the loss and settlement expense ratio losses and settlement expenses expressed as a percentage of premiums earned decreased to percent in from percent in  despite an unusually high level of catastrophe and storm losses that was second only to the record amount reported in storm plagued  and some necessary reserve strengthening 
this decline in the loss and settlement expense ratio was attributed to improved premium rate adequacy  an improvement in the quality of the company s book of business and unusually good loss experience in the reinsurance segment during the second half of the year 
the loss and settlement expense ratio for the property and casualty segment increased slightly to percent in from percent in despite an unusually high level of catastrophe and storm losses  in compared to  in and some necessary reserve strengthening  the loss and settlement expense ratio did not increase appreciably during this is due to management s diligent efforts over the last several years to improve both premium rate adequacy and the quality of the risks insured 
loss frequency continued to trend downward in while loss severity continued to increase 
the reserve strengthening performed in amounted to approximately  which represented only percent of the property and casualty insurance segment s carried reserves at december  the loss and settlement expense ratio for the reinsurance segment decreased to percent in from percent in this improvement was attributed to an unusually low level of reported loss activity from both proportional and excess of loss business  and from favorable development on prior years reserves 
however  this improvement was partially offset by a significant increase in catastrophe losses  in compared to  in 
during  two events midwest storms in the month of may and hurricane isabel reached the  cap on losses assumed per event from employers mutual 
in addition  the reinsurance segment established  of additional ibnr reserves in in response to the findings of an independent study conducted on the company s asbestos exposures 
acquisition and other expenses acquisition and other expenses increased percent to  in from  in the expense ratio acquisition and other expenses expressed as a percentage of premiums earned decreased to percent in from percent in  primarily due to the improvement in premium rate adequacy achieved in for the property and casualty insurance segment  the expense ratio increased to percent in from percent in this increase was primarily due to an increase in contingent commission expense and higher employee benefit costs 
the increase in contingent commission expense was a direct result of the fundamental improvement achieved in underwriting results 
the increase in employee benefit costs was associated with a basis point decrease in the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumptions utilized in the pension plan and postretirement benefit plans actuarial valuations 
for the reinsurance segment  the expense ratio decreased to percent in from percent in the decrease in was attributed to a decline in contingent commission expense and a shift in the mix of business towards property excess  which carries a lower commission rate 
the decline in contingent commission expense was attributed to several sources  including a decline of approximately  associated with the mrb pool and a marine syndicate account  a decline of approximately  associated with the commutation of a retrocession contract related to the world trade center catastrophe  and a general trend toward a reduction in the number of contracts with contingent commission provisions 
the asset for deferred acquisitions costs increased in and in connection with the increased participation in the mrb pool 
these increases offset commission expense of  and  recorded for statutory purposes in those respective years with the increased participation in the mrb pool 
investment results net investment income decreased percent to  in from  in  despite an increase in invested assets 
this decrease was primarily attributed to the lingering low interest rate environment  which negatively impacted the rate of return earned on the company s investments  but also reflected an increase in investment expenses 
during this period of low interest rates  many of the company s higher yielding securities were called 
the proceeds from those called securities  and from maturing securities  were reinvested at the current lower interest rates  resulting in less investment income 
in addition  until the latter half of the company was reluctant to invest in long term securities in this current low interest rate environment and therefore had accumulated a significant amount of short term and cash equivalent investments 
since these investments carry lower interest rates than long term fixed maturity securities  the decline in the company s rate of return was magnified 
realized investment gains totaled  in compared to a loss of  in reflected in the gains of were  of other than temporary impairment losses recognized in the company s equity portfolio during the first quarter of   of net losses recognized by the company s equity managers during the first quarter as they rebalanced the company s portfolios to enhance future returns  and  of losses recognized on the sale of american airlines and united airlines bonds during the first quarter 
these bonds were collateralized by aircraft with an appraised value sufficient to recover the company s investment at december   however  during the first quarter of the value of the collateral declined below the company s investment as a result of the war with iraq  a significant decline in air travel  and the prospects of a bankruptcy filing by american airlines and a liquidation of united airlines 
the losses recognized in the first quarter were more than offset by gains recognized on the sale of certain bond and equity investments during the remainder of the company did not recognize any additional other than temporary impairment losses during and all the impaired equity securities were sold before year end  generating gross realized gains of  and gross realized losses of  the realized investment loss for primarily reflected a  impairment loss on the company s investment in mci communications corporation bonds 
other information the company refinanced its  of surplus notes with employers mutual effective april  at an interest rate of percent  resulting in a percent decline in interest expense in income tax expense increased percent to  in from  in the effective tax rate increased slightly to percent in from percent in in response to the declining interest rate environment  employers mutual changed several key assumptions utilized in the preparation of the actuarial valuation reports for its pension and postretirement benefit plans during and key assumption changes include a reduction in the discount rate from percent in to percent in and a reduction in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets for the pension plan from percent in to percent in and for the postretirement benefit plans from percent in to percent in in addition  the assumed health care cost trend rate utilized in the postretirement benefit plan valuation report was decreased from percent in to percent in prior to  the company had concluded that it was not subject to the accounting requirements of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  since it received the current fair value for any common stock issued under employers mutual s stock option plans 
as a result  the company was recognizing as compensation expense its pool participation share of the stock option expense recorded by employers mutual for these plans 
during  the company concluded that it was subject to the accounting requirements of apb and  accordingly  should not be recognizing compensation expense from employers mutual s stock option plans since the exercise price of the options was equal to the fair value of the stock at the date of grant 
accordingly  during the company reversed the accrual for stock option expense allocated to it by employers mutual  resulting in  of pre tax income 
the company s insurance subsidiaries reimburse employers mutual for their share of the statutory basis compensation expense associated with stock option exercises under the terms of the pooling and quota share agreements 
beginning in  the statutory basis compensation expense that was paid by the company s subsidiaries to employers mutual  in was reclassified as a dividend payment to employers mutual in these gaap basis financial statements 
since the corresponding amounts for were not material  the financial statements for that year were not restated 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to generate sufficient cash to meet cash obligations as they come due 
the company generated positive cash flows from operations of  in   in and  in the company typically generates substantial positive cash flows from operations because cash from premium payments is generally received in advance of cash payments made to settle claims 
these positive cash flows provide the foundation of the company s asset liability management program and are the primary drivers of the company s liquidity 
when investing funds made available from operations  the company invests in securities with maturities that approximate the anticipated liabilities of the insurance issued 
in addition  the company maintains a portion of its investment portfolio in relatively short term and highly liquid assets as a secondary source of liquidity should net cash flows from operating activities prove inadequate to fund current operating needs 
as of december   the company did not have any significant variations between the maturity dates of its investments and the expected payment of its loss and settlement expense reserves 
the company is a holding company whose principal assets are its investments in its insurance subsidiaries 
as a holding company  the company is dependent upon cash dividends from its insurance company subsidiaries to meet its obligations and to pay cash dividends to its stockholders 
state insurance regulations restrict the maximum amount of dividends insurance companies can pay without prior regulatory approval 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding dividend restrictions 
the maximum amount of dividends that the insurance company subsidiaries can pay to the company in without prior regulatory approval is approximately million 
the company received   and  of dividends from its insurance company subsidiaries and paid cash dividends to its stockholders totaling   and  in  and  respectively 
the company s insurance company subsidiaries must have adequate liquidity to ensure that their cash obligations are met  however  because of their participation in the pooling agreement and the quota share agreement  they do not have the daily liquidity concerns normally associated with an insurance or reinsurance company 
this is due to the fact that under the terms of the pooling and quota share agreements  employers mutual receives all premiums and pays all losses and expenses associated with the insurance business produced by the pool participants and the assumed reinsurance business ceded to the company s reinsurance subsidiary  and then settles the inter company balances generated by these transactions with the participating companies on a quarterly basis 
at the insurance company subsidiary level  the primary sources of cash are premium income  investment income and maturing investments 
the principal outflows of cash are payments of claims  commissions  premium taxes  operating expenses  income taxes  dividends  interest and principal payments on debt  and investment purchases 
cash outflows can be variable because of uncertainties regarding settlement dates for unpaid losses and because of the potential for large losses  either individually or in the aggregate 
accordingly  the insurance company subsidiaries maintain investment and reinsurance programs generally intended to provide adequate funds to pay claims without forced sales of investments 
the company maintains a portion of its investment portfolio in relatively short term and highly liquid investments to ensure the availability of funds to pay claims and expenses 
the remainder of the investment portfolio  excluding investments in equity securities  is invested in securities with maturities that approximate the anticipated liabilities of the insurance written 
at december   approximately percent of the company s fixed maturity securities were in us government or us government agency issued securities 
a variety of maturities are maintained in the company s portfolio to assure adequate liquidity 
the maturity structure of the fixed maturity investments is also established by the relative attractiveness of yields on short  intermediate and long term securities 
the company does not invest in any high yield debt investments commonly referred to as junk bonds 
the company considers itself to be a long term investor and generally purchases fixed maturity investments with the intent to hold them to maturity 
despite this intent  the company has historically classified a portion of its fixed maturity investments as available for sale securities to provide flexibility in the management of the portfolio 
since the third quarter of  all newly acquired fixed maturity investments have been classified as available for sale securities to provide increased management flexibility 
the company had unrealized holding gains  net of deferred taxes  on fixed maturity securities available for sale totaling  and  at december  and  respectively 
the fluctuation in the market value of these investments is primarily due to changes in the interest rate environment during this time period 
since the company does not actively trade in the bond market  such fluctuations in the fair value of these investments are not expected to have a material impact on the operations of the company  as forced liquidations of investments are not anticipated 
the company closely monitors the bond market and makes appropriate adjustments in its portfolio as changing conditions warrant 
the majority of the company s assets are invested in fixed maturity securities 
these investments provide a substantial amount of investment income that supplements underwriting results and contributes to net earnings 
as these investments mature  or are called  the proceeds will be reinvested at current rates  which may be higher or lower than those now being earned  therefore  more or less investment income may be available to contribute to net earnings depending on the interest rate level 
the company participates in a securities lending program administered by mellon bank  na whereby certain fixed maturity securities from the investment portfolio are loaned to other institutions for short periods of time 
the company receives a fee for each security loaned out under this program and requires initial collateral  primarily cash  equal to percent of the market value of the loaned securities 
the cash collateral that secures the company s loaned securities is invested in a delaware statutory trust that is managed by mellon bank 
the earnings from this trust are used  in part  to pay the fee the company receives for each security loaned under the program 
the company held  and  in minority ownership interests in limited partnerships and limited liability companies at december  and  respectively 
the company does not hold any other unregistered securities 
the company s cash balance was  and  at december  and  respectively 
the balance at december  reflects a  transfer of funds out of the cash account on december  to purchase a fixed maturity security  however  due to timing  the account does not reflect the corresponding transfer of cash into the account to fund the purchase 
this timing difference resulted in the negative balance in the account 
the company carried a pension asset of  at december  at december  the company reported a pension liability of  including  of additional minimum liability 
this change in the funded status of the pension plan was driven by a  pension plan contributions made during along with the additional minimum liability reported on the company s pension plan at december  was an intangible asset of  postretirement benefit liabilities reflected in the company s financial statements totaled  and  at december  and  respectively 
capital resources capital resources consist of stockholders equity and debt  representing funds deployed or available to be deployed to support business operations 
for the company s insurance subsidiaries  capital resources are required to support premium writings 
regulatory guidelines suggest that the ratio of a property and casualty insurer s annual net premiums written to its statutory surplus should not exceed to all of the company s insurance subsidiaries were well under this guideline at december  the company s insurance subsidiaries are required to maintain certain minimum surplus on a statutory basis and are subject to regulations under which payment of dividends from statutory surplus is restricted and may require prior approval of their domiciliary insurance regulatory authorities 
the company s insurance subsidiaries are also subject to risk based capital rbc requirements that may further impact their ability to pay dividends 
rbc requirements attempt to measure minimum statutory capital needs based upon the risks in a company s mix of products and investment portfolio 
at december   the company s insurance subsidiaries had total adjusted statutory capital of  which is well in excess of the minimum rbc requirement of  the company had total cash and invested assets with a carrying value of million and million as of december  and december   respectively

   mortgage backed securities   public utilities    debt securities issued by foreign governments   corporate securities    total fixed maturity securities    equity securities    total securities available for sale    in december  three of the company s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries issued surplus notes totaling million to employers mutual at an annual interest rate of percent 
in june  the company s reinsurance subsidiary issued an million surplus note to employers mutual at an annual interest rate of percent 
effective april   these surplus notes were reissued at an annual interest rate of percent 
these notes do not have a maturity date 
payment of interest and repayment of principal can only be made out of the applicable subsidiary s statutory surplus and is subject to prior approval by the insurance commissioner of the respective state of domicile 
the surplus notes are subordinate and junior in right of payment to all obligations or liabilities of the applicable insurance subsidiaries 
the company s subsidiaries incurred interest expense of   and  in   and  respectively  on these surplus notes 
the surplus notes were issued in response to statutory capital adequacy concerns raised by certain rating agencies because the statutory surplus position of the subsidiaries had declined over the preceding three years due to unfavorable operating results and the payment of dividends to the parent corporation 
at december   the company s subsidiaries had received approval for the payment of interest accrued on the surplus notes during as of december   the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
off balance sheet arrangements employers mutual receives all premiums and pays all losses and expenses associated with the assumed reinsurance business ceded to the reinsurance subsidiary and the insurance business produced by the pool participants  and then settles the inter company balances generated by these transactions with the participating companies on a quarterly basis 
when settling the inter company balances  employers mutual provides the reinsurance subsidiary and the pool participants with full credit for the premiums written during the quarter and retains all receivable amounts 
any receivable amounts that are ultimately deemed to be uncollectible are charged off by employers mutual and the expense is charged to the reinsurance subsidiary or allocated to the pool members on the basis of pool participation 
as a result  the company has an off balance sheet arrangement with an unconsolidated entity that results in a credit risk exposure that is not reflected in the company s financial statements 
based on historical data  this credit risk exposure is not considered to be material to the company s results of operations or financial position 
investment impairments and considerations during the company had one fixed maturity security series mci communications corporation that was determined other than temporarily impaired 
mci communications corporation was owned by worldcom inc  whose corporate bonds were downgraded to junk status in may when it reported the detection of accounting irregularities 
on june  the company recognized  of realized loss when the carrying value of this investment was reduced from an aggregate book value of  to the then current fair value of  the fair value of the mci bonds then partially recovered  resulting in pre tax unrealized gains of  recognized during and  recognized during during the second quarter of the company received three new series of fixed maturity securities with impaired book values issued by mci communications corporation in conjunction with a payout award received under a bankruptcy court approved plan of reorganization 
this payout was recorded as a tax free exchange and the new bonds were assigned a book value equal to the book value of the defaulted bonds that were replaced 
the par value of the new bonds reflected the settlement amount of cents per dollar  and the fair value of the new bonds was  at the time of the payout 
based on these facts  a realized investment gain of  was recognized in the second quarter of to offset the other than temporary impairment loss previously recognized in the second quarter of and an other than temporary impairment loss of  was recognized to reduce the book value of the new bonds to fair value at the time of the payout 
the new bonds were sold during the third quarter of  resulting in an additional realized gain of  at december   the company had unrealized losses on held to maturity and available for sale securities as presented in the table below 
the estimated fair value is based on quoted market prices  where available  or on values obtained from independent pricing services 
none of these securities are considered to be in concentrations by either security type or industry 
the company uses several factors to determine whether the carrying value of an individual security has been other than temporarily impaired 
such factors include  but are not limited to  the security s value and performance in the context of the overall markets  length of time and extent the security s fair value has been below carrying value  key corporate events and collateralization of fixed maturity securities 
based on these factors  and the company s ability and intent to hold the fixed maturity securities until maturity  it was determined that the carrying value of these securities was not other than temporarily impaired at december  risks and uncertainties inherent in the methodology utilized in this evaluation process include interest rate risk  equity price risk and the overall performance of the economy  all of which have the potential to adversely affect the value of the company s investments 
should a determination be made at some point in the future that these unrealized losses are other than temporary  the company s earnings would be reduced by approximately  net of tax  however  the company s financial position would not be affected due to the fact that unrealized losses on available for sale securities are reflected in the company s financial statements as a component of stockholders equity  net of deferred taxes 
following is a schedule of the length of time securities have continuously been in an unrealized loss position as of december  description of securities fair value unrealized losses in thousands fixed maturity securities less than six months  six to twelve months  twelve months or longer  total fixed maturity securities  equity securities less than six months  six to twelve months twelve months or longer total equity securities

  due after ten years   the company has no fixed maturity securities available for sale that are non investment grade and have unrealized losses at december  as previously noted  the company does not invest in junk bonds 
any non investment grade securities held by the company are the result of rating downgrades that occurred subsequent to their purchase 
following is a schedule of gross realized losses recognized in along with the associated book values and sales prices aged according to the length of time the underlying securities were in an unrealized loss position 
this schedule does not include realized losses stemming from corporate actions such as calls  pay downs  redemptions  etc 
the company s equity portfolio is managed on a tax aware basis  which generally results in sales of securities at a loss to offset sales of securities at a gain  thus minimizing the company s income tax expense

these amounts are based on historical payment patterns and do not represent actual contractual obligations 
the actual payment amounts and the related timing of those amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
long term debt reflects the surplus notes issued by the company s insurance subsidiaries to employer mutual  which have no maturity date 
interest on the surplus notes amounts to  annually  and is subject to approval by the issuing company s state of domicile 
excluded from long term debt are pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
estimated guaranty fund assessments of  and  which are used by states to pay claims of insolvent insurers domiciled in that state  have been accrued as of december  and  respectively 
the guaranty fund assessments are expected to be paid over the next two years with premium tax offsets of  expected to be realized within ten years of the payments

the periods over which the assessments will be paid is not known 
the participants in the pooling agreement have purchased annuities from life insurance companies  under which the claimant is payee  to fund future payments that are fixed pursuant to specific claim settlement provisions 
the company s share of loss reserves eliminated by the purchase of these annuities was  at december  the company has a contingent liability of  should the issuers of these annuities fail to perform under the terms of the annuities 
the company s share of the amount due from any one life insurance company does not equal or exceed one percent of its subsidiaries policyholders surplus 
market risk the main objectives in managing the investment portfolios of the company are to maximize after tax investment income and total investment return while minimizing credit risks  in order to provide maximum support for the underwriting operations 
investment strategies are developed based upon many factors including underwriting results and the company s resulting tax position  regulatory requirements  fluctuations in interest rates and consideration of other market risks 
investment decisions are centrally managed by investment professionals and are supervised by the investment committees of the respective board of directors for each of the company s subsidiaries 
market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the market risks of the financial instruments of the company relate to the investment portfolio  which exposes the company to interest rate and equity price risk  and to a lesser extent credit quality and prepayment risk 
monitoring systems and analytical tools are in place to assess each of these elements of market risk 
interest rate risk includes the price sensitivity of a fixed maturity security to changes in interest rates  and the affect on future earnings from short term investments and maturing long term investments given a change in interest rates 
the following analysis illustrates the sensitivity of the company s financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices 
a hypothetical one percent increase in interest rates as of december  would result in a corresponding pre tax decrease in the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio of approximately  or percent 
in addition  a hypothetical one percent decrease in interest rates at december  would result in a corresponding decrease in pre tax income over the next twelve months of approximately  assuming the current maturity and prepayment patterns 
the company monitors interest rate risk through the analysis of interest rate simulations  and adjusts the average duration of its fixed maturity portfolio by investing in either longer or shorter term instruments given the results of interest rate simulations and judgments of cash flow needs 
the effective duration of the company s fixed maturity portfolio at december  was years 
the valuation of the company s marketable equity portfolios is subject to equity price risk 
in general  equities have more year to year price variability than bonds 
however  returns from equity securities have been consistently higher over longer time frames 
the company invests in a diversified portfolio of readily marketable equity securities 
a hypothetical percent decrease in the s p index as of december  would result in a corresponding pre tax decrease in the fair value of the company s equity portfolio of approximately  the company invests in high quality fixed maturity securities  thus minimizing credit quality risk 
at december   the portfolio of long term fixed maturity securities consists of percent us treasury  percent government agency  percent mortgage backed  percent municipal  and percent corporate securities 
at december   the portfolio of long term fixed maturity securities consisted of percent us treasury  percent government agency  percent mortgage backed  percent municipal  and percent corporate securities 
fixed maturity securities held by the company generally have an investment quality rating of a or better by independent rating agencies 
the following table shows the composition of the company s fixed maturity securities  by rating  as of december  securities securities held to maturity available for sale at amortized cost at fair value in thousands amount percent amount percent rating aaa   aa  a  baa  b  total fixed maturities   ratings for preferred stocks and fixed maturity securities with initial maturities greater than one year are assigned by moody s investor s services  inc moody s rating process seeks to evaluate the quality of a security by examining the factors that affect returns to investors 
moody s ratings are based on quantitative and qualitative factors  as well as the economic  social and political environment in which the issuing entity exists 
the quantitative factors include debt coverage  sales and income growth  cash flows and liquidity ratios 
qualitative factors include management quality  access to capital markets and the quality of earnings and balance sheet items 
ratings for securities with initial maturities less than one year are based on an evaluation of the underlying assets or the credit rating of the issuer s parent company 
prepayment risk refers to the changes in prepayment patterns that can shorten or lengthen the expected timing of principal repayments and thus the average life and the effective yield of a security 
such risk exists primarily within the portfolio of mortgage backed securities 
the prepayment risk analysis is monitored regularly through the analysis of interest rate simulations 
at december   the effective duration of the mortgage backed securities is years with an average life and current yield of years and percent  respectively 
at december   the effective duration of the mortgage backed securities was years with an average life and current yield of years and percent  respectively 
impact of inflation inflation has a widespread effect on the company s results of operations  primarily through increased losses and settlement expenses 
the company considers inflation  including social inflation that reflects an increasingly litigious society and increasing jury awards  when setting reserve amounts 
premiums are also affected by inflation  although they are often restricted or delayed by competition and the regulatory rate setting environment 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim and annual periods after june   with earlier adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously allowed under statement no 
will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
the transition methods for adoption include the modified prospective and modified retroactive methods 
the modified prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options that exist upon the adoption of statement r 
under the modified retroactive method  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the company is currently evaluating the requirements of statement r  but does not expect adoption of this statement to have a material effect on the operating results of the company 
in  the emerging issues task force eitf of the fasb reached a consensus on certain disclosures required by eitf issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which was effective for fiscal years ending after december  the company adopted this eitf in  which only required additional disclosures and did not have any effect on the operating results of the company
