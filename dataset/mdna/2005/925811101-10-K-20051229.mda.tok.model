the company is vigorously defending itself and is a party to a joint defense with certain other named defendants 
the company is unable to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss  if any  at this time 
although the company believes that it has meritorious defenses to such claims  there is a possibility that an unfavorable outcome could ultimately occur that could result in a liability that is material to the company s results of operations and financial position 
the company may attempt to settle the case 
however  there can be no assurance that any settlement can be reached 
in connection with this suit  the company filed a request with the us patent and trademark office for reexamination of the plaintiff s patent 
in april  such request was granted by the us patent and trademark office  who found sufficient evidence to warrant a reexamination of the plaintiff s patent 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
as it relates to product sales  revenue is generally recognized when products are sold and title is passed to the customer 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
advance service billings under a national supply contract with one customer are deferred and recognized as revenues on a pro rata basis over the term of the service agreement 
pursuant to the adoption of eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  the company evaluates multiple element revenue arrangements for separate units of accounting  and follows appropriate revenue recognition policies for each separate unit 
elements are considered separate units of accounting provided that i the delivered item has stand alone value to the customer  ii there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the delivered item  and iii if a general right of return exists relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially within the control of the company 
as applied to the company  under arrangements involving the sale of product and the provision of services  product sales are recognized as revenue when the products are sold and title is passed to the customer  and service revenue is recognized as services are performed 
for products that include more than incidental software  and for separate licenses of the company s software products  the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while the company engages in product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  its warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from its estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence and slow moving inventory equal to the difference between the carrying cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
technology changes and market conditions may render some of the company s products obsolete and additional inventory write downs may be required 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of its long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets with finite useful lives  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
the company evaluates the recoverability of such assets based upon the expectations of undiscounted cash flows from such assets 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss would be recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount 
the company s ability to recover the reported amounts of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient taxable income during the periods over which net temporary tax differences become deductible 
in fiscal  the company recognized a million charge to provide a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of future realization 
the establishment of such valuation allowance was determined to be appropriate during that period due to updated judgments in light of the company s operating losses in current and past years and the inherent uncertainties of predicting future operating results in periods over which such net tax differences become deductible 
the company plans to provide a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets until such time that it can achieve a sustained level of profitability or other positive evidence arises that would demonstrate an ability to recover such assets 
the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to labor  product and other matters 
the company assesses the likelihood of an adverse judgment or outcomes for these matters  as well as the range of potential losses 
a determination of the reserves required  if any  is made after careful analysis 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments 
recent accounting pronouncements as permitted by sfas no 
 the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values at the date of grant 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two prescribed methods 
the modified prospective method requires compensation cost to be recognized based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all outstanding vested stock option grants and all share based payments granted after the effective date 
such method allows for the use of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
the modified retrospective method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company has adopted statement r on october  the adoption of this statement will have the effect of reducing net income and earnings per share or increasing net loss and net loss per share as compared to what would have been reported under the current requirements 
the company is presently unable to determine the precise future annual impact of this statement on its results of operations since such determination would require knowledge of future events and facts unknown to the company at this time 
however  at september   the company had  unvested options on which future compensation cost will be recognized 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  which adopts wording from the international accounting standards board s ias  inventories  in an effort to improve the comparability of cross border financial reporting 
the new standard indicates that abnormal freight  handling costs and wasted materials are required to be treated as current period charges rather than as a portion of inventory costs 
additionally  the standard clarifies that fixed production overhead should be allocated based on the normal capacity of a production facility 
sfas no 
will become effective for the company s fiscal year ending september  the company does not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which replaces apb opinion no 
accounting changes and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas no 
is effective for the company s fiscal year ending september  and requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements of voluntary changes in accounting principle  unless it is impractical to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows will only be impacted by sfas no 
if it implements a voluntary change in accounting principle or correct accounting errors in future periods 
foreign currency activity the company s foreign exchange exposure is principally limited to the relationship of the us dollar to the british pound sterling  the euro and the israeli shekel

the company s israeli based subsidiary incurs shekel based operating expenses which are funded by the company in us dollars 
in past years  the company had purchased forward exchange contracts to minimize its currency exposure on these expenses during periods of favorable fluctuating exchange rates 
as of september   the company had forward exchange contracts outstanding with notional amounts aggregating million 
the company also attempts to reduce the impact of an unfavorable exchange rate condition through cost reductions from its suppliers and shifting product sourcing to suppliers transacting in more stable and favorable currencies 
in general  the company seeks lower costs from suppliers and enters into forward exchange contracts to mitigate short term exchange rate exposures 
however  there can be no assurance that such steps will be effective in limiting long term foreign currency exposure 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk factors the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company has a policy that prohibits the use of currency derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures and minimize the effect of such fluctuations on reported earnings and cash flow see foreign currency activity  note derivative instruments and fair value of financial instruments to the accompanying financial statements 
at september   the company s foreign currency exchange risks included an aggregate million of intercompany account balances between the company and its subsidiaries  which are short term and will be settled in fiscal the following sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in foreign currency exchange rates from year end levels  with all other variables held constant 
at september   a strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the british pound would result in a  decrease or increase  respectively  in the intercompany accounts receivable balance 
certain of such foreign currency exchange risk at september  has been hedged by million of forward exchange contracts 
at september   the company had million of outstanding floating rate bank debt which was covered by an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converts the foregoing floating rate debt to stated fixed rates see note long term debt to the accompanying financial statements 
thus  the company has substantially no net interest rate exposures on these instruments 
however  the company had approximately  of floating rate bank debt that is subject to interest rate risk as it was not covered by an interest rate swap agreement 
the company does not believe that a fluctuation in interest rates would have a material effect on its consolidated financial position and results of operations 
related party transactions refer to item and note related party transactions to the accompanying financial statements 
inflation the impact of inflation on the company has been minimal in recent years as the rate of inflation remains low
