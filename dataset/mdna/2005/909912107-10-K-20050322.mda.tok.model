item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition an d results of operations general the following discussion of the company s financial condition and results o f operations should be read in conjunction with the description of the company s business and properties contained in items and of part i and th e consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  included elsewhere in thi s report 
results of operations and net income for the year ended december  was million or pe r basic share  an increase of over net income of million or pe r basic share for the year ended december  income from continuin g operations increased to million or per basic share for th e current year versus million or per basic share for tota l revenues were million for the year ended december   an increase o f million or from the previous year 
the results of include million in pre tax gains on the sale of available for sale securities and million in gains on the sale of real estate  net of tax  and accounted for a s discontinued operations  above those recognized in the prior year 
the compan y is unable to predict whether these trends will continue  as it is dependent upo n future economic conditions and the sale of additional marketable securities an d real estate assets 
real estate operations rental revenues from real estate operations remained relatively consistent wit h those of the prior year  totaling million in each of the years ende d december  and there were  however  changes in the components o f rental revenues as follows a decrease in hotel operating revenue  partially offset by the recognition of non recurring transactions  i n in general  rental revenues do not fluctuate significantly due to th e long term nature of the company s leases 
however  future rental revenues coul d be affected by changes in hotel operating revenues  which are generall y influenced by local and other economic conditions  as well as by lease renewals terminations  step ups and escalations and by the purchase or sale of additiona l properties 
mortgage interest expense decreased  or to  for the yea r ended december   compared to  for the year ended december this decrease is the result of continuing mortgage amortization

mortgage interest expense on existin g obligations will continue to decline with scheduled principle reductions 
depreciation expense associated with real properties held for rental decrease d by  or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for this decrease was primarily attributable t o reduced depreciation expense associated with certain properties or improvement s becoming fully depreciated in the current and prior years 
other operating expenses associated with the management of real propertie s increased approximately  or to million during  versu s such expenses incurred of million in the increase is primarily th e result of increased real estate taxes  professional fees  and property maintenance expense  partially offset by a decrease i n hotel operating expense 
engineered products the company s engineered products segment includes metex and afp transformers the operating results of the engineered products segment are as follows year ended december  in thousands net sales   cost of sales   selling  general and administrative expenses   operating income   net sales of the engineered products segment increased million or fo r the year ended december   compared to net sales in the preceding year this increase is primarily due to increased demand  primarily in the company s transformer and engineered product lines  as well as a slight increase in th e automotive product line  which was brought about by a general improvement in th e us economy and an increase in capital spending  which had declined over th e last several years 
although management believes that sales of its engineere d products segment are directly influenced by general economic conditions worldwide automotive demand and industrial capital spending  future sales of th e company s engineered products segment could also be affected by changes i n technology  competitive forces or challenges to its intellectual property 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales remained relatively consistent fo r the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  fluctuating b y less then 
selling  general and administrative expenses of the engineered products segmen t increased  or for the year ended december  over th e previous year 
the increase is primarily due to increased freight cost s  as well as from higher payroll and payroll related costs  and commissions  which also fluctuated with the change in sales note d above 
these increases are partially offset by a reduction in professional fee s  license fees associated with an agreement that expired in  and a decrease in amortization expenses 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses not associated with the manufacturin g operations decreased  or during  compared to such expense s incurred in the preceding year 
the decrease is principally due to lowe r professional fees  and pension related expenses  offset b y higher insurance costs  and depreciation expenses 
other income and expense  net other income and expense  net increased million or to millio n for the year ended december   compared to the increase i s principally due to higher net gains on available for sale securities million  which primarily relates to the million gain recognized upon th e sale of the company s interest in prime hospitality corp  the receipt o f  in casualty insurance proceeds and a  gain on the sale of othe r assets 
these increases are partially offset by lower net realized an d unrealized gains on derivative instruments million  lower equity i n earnings of the hotel ventures  a non recurring deposit forfeitur e  which occurred in  and lower net realized and unrealized gain s on trading securities  during the current year 
the company is unabl e to predict whether these trends will continue  as it is dependent upon futur e economic conditions and the sale of additional marketable securities 
income taxes the effective tax rate from continuing operations was for the year ende d december   versus for the year ended december  th e reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of tax benefits fro m the donation of certain properties to qualified organizations during the curren t year

cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased for the year ende d  compared to  principally due to the continued implementation of cos t containment measures and favorable currency effects on sales denominated i n foreign currency 
selling  general and administrative expenses of the engineered products segmen t increased less than one percent for the year ended december   versus th e comparable period 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses not associated with the manufacturin g operations decreased  or during  compared to such expense s incurred in the preceding year 
the decrease is principally due to a reductio n in pension related expenses  and salary and salary related expense s  offset by an increase in professional fees  and franchis e taxes 
other income and expense  net other income and expense  net decreased million from million in to million in the decrease is principally due to lower net realize d and unrealized gains on derivative instruments and available for sale securitie s of million offset by equity in earnings of the hotel ventures of  and a deposit forfeiture of  discontinued operations income from operations on properties sold or held for sale and accounted for a s discontinued was million on a net of tax basis for versus millio n in prior year amounts have been reclassified to reflect the results o f real properties currently classified as held for sale or disposed of during th e last three years

net gains on the sale of real estate accounted for as discontinue d operations were million on a net of tax basis for the year ended decembe r   which includes a million gain  on a net of tax basis  relating t o a property sold in and recognized under the installment method i n accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states o f america offset by a  write down  on a net of tax basis  for a propert y disposed of in january for a sale price below its carrying value 
durin g  since the adoption of sfas no 
 the company sold three properties wit h proceeds of  net gains on the sale of real estate accounted for a s discontinued operations were  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended decembe r  the company experienced a net cash inflow from operations o f approximately million and million during the years ended december and  respectively 
the change in operating cash flow from to primarily results from an increase in net income partially offset by additiona l gains from available for sale securities million and net gains on th e sale of real estate accounted for as discontinued operations million  ne t of tax  changes in working capital million  primarily income taxe s payable  and lower net proceeds from the sale of trading securities million 
the  increase in operating cash flow from to primarily results from increases in net proceeds from the sale of tradin g securities and income from operations offset by changes in working capital 
net cash provided by investing activities increased million for the yea r ended december   compared with the year ended december  thi s increase primarily results from the timing of the purchase or sale o f available for sale securities and derivative instruments million and a n additional million in proceeds from the sale of real estate and othe r assets offset by a decrease in distributions from the company s investments i n joint ventures million 
in  cash provided by investing activities was million  whic h consisted primarily of a million net distribution from joint ventures an d million of proceeds from the sale of real estate assets offset by ne t purchases of available for sale securities of million 
the ne t distribution from joint ventures of million consists of million i n proceeds from financing of the joint venture hotels and million fro m capital distributions 
in addition  during the year the company purchased a n interest in a full service hotel for million and received proceeds of million from the sale of interests in the joint venture hotels 
in  million was used in investing activities  which consiste d primarily of a million investment in a joint venture hotel  net purchase s of available for sale securities and derivative instruments of million an d a million purchase of a note receivable 
these were partially offset b y proceeds from the sale of real estate assets of million 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately million  million and million during  and  respectively 
the reductio n in cash used for financing activities primarily results from the payment o f dividends of million during and the purchase and retirement of million and million of the company s common stock during and respectively 
such transactions did not occur in at december   the company s cash and marketable securities were million and working capital was million  compared to cash and marketabl e securities of million and working capital of million at decembe r  management continues to believe that the real estate market i s overvalued and accordingly acquisitions have been limited to those selec t properties that meet the company s stringent financial requirements 
managemen t believes that the available working capital  along with the million o f availability on the revolving credit facility  discussed below  puts the compan y in an opportune position to fund acquisitions and grow the portfolio if and whe n attractive long term opportunities become available 
the equity method of accounting is used for investments in to owne d joint ventures in which the company has the ability to exercise significan t influence  but not control 
these investments are recorded initially at cost an d subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions an d distributions 
the debt of the joint ventures in which the company has a n ownership interest are non recourse obligations and are collateralized by th e entity s real property 
in one instance  the company and another party hav e jointly and severally guaranteed not more than million of the joint venture s mortgage obligation 
the company believes  in each case  that the value of th e underlying property and its operating cash flows are sufficient to satisfy it s obligations 
except for this guarantee  the company is not obligated for th e debts of the joint ventures  but could decide to satisfy them in order t o protect its investment 
in such event  the company s capital resources an d financial condition would be reduced and  in certain instances  the carryin g value of the company s investment and its results of operations would b e negatively impacted 
on june   the board of directors of the company declared a specia l one time cash dividend of per common share split adjusted to al l stockholders of record as of june  this dividend  totaling million  was paid on july  while the company does not currently expec t to pay additional dividends  the board of directors could reevaluate thi s position in the future 
the cash needs of the company have been satisfied from funds generated b y current operations 
it is expected that future operational cash needs will als o be satisfied from existing cash balances  marketable securities  ongoin g operations and borrowings under the revolver as hereinafter defined 
th e primary source of capital to fund additional real estate acquisitions and t o make additional high yield mortgage loans may come from existing funds borrowings under the revolver  the sale  financing and refinancing of th e company s properties and from third party mortgages and purchase money note s obtained in connection with specific acquisitions 
in addition to the acquisition of properties for consideration consisting o f cash and mortgage financing proceeds  the company may acquire real properties i n exchange for the issuance of the company s equity securities 
the company ma y also finance acquisitions of other companies in the future with borrowings fro m institutional lenders and or the public or private offerings of debt or equit y securities 
the company currently has no agreements  commitments o r understandings with respect to the acquisition of other companies or th e acquisition of real properties in exchange for equity securities 
funds of the company in excess of those needed for working capital  purchasin g real estate and arranging financing for real estate acquisitions are invested b y the company in corporate equity securities  corporate notes  certificates o f deposit  government securities and other financial instruments 
changes in u 
s interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash and cas h equivalent balances and other interest bearing investments 
although interes t rates have begun to rise  given the level of cash and other interest bearin g investments currently held by the company and the decline in us interest rate s over the past several years  the company s earnings have been negativel y impacted 
effective december   the company entered into a credit agreement wit h five banks which provides for an million revolving credit facilit y revolver 
the revolver may be increased under certain circumstances an d expires on december  under the revolver  the company will be provided with eligibility based upon th e sum of i of the aggregate annualized and normalized year to date ne t operating income of unencumbered eligible properties  as defined  capitalized a t  ii of the aggregate annualized and normalized year to date ne t operating income of unencumbered eligible hotel properties  as defined capitalized at  not to exceed the lesser of million or of tota l eligibility  iii the lesser of million or of the aggregate annualize d and normalized year to date net operating income of encumbered eligibl e properties  as defined  capitalized at  iv the sum of of eligibl e accounts receivable  of eligible inventory and of eligible loans  a s defined  v cash and cash equivalents in excess of working capital  as defined and vi of marketable securities  as defined 
at december  eligibility under the revolver was million based upon the above terms an d there were no amounts outstanding under the revolver 
the credit agreement contains certain financial and restrictive covenants  a s follows i total debt cannot exceed of capitalization value  as defined ii equity value  as defined  must be at least million  iii interes t coverage  as defined  must not be less than  iv debt servic e coverage  as defined  must not be less than  v eligible propertie s debt service coverage  as defined  must be not less than  vi capita l expenditures  exclusive of real estate  must not exceed million annually vii capitalization value  as defined  must not be less than million an d viii operating lease obligations must not exceed million annually 
th e company was in compliance with all covenants at december  the credi t agreement also contains provisions which allow the banks to perfect a securit y interest in certain operating and real estate assets in the event of a default as defined in the credit agreement 
borrowings under the revolver  at th e company s option  bear interest at the bank s prime lending rate or at th e london interbank offered rate libor at december  plus fo r non cash collateralized borrowings and for cash collateralized borrowings 
in strategies designed to hedge overall market risk  the company may sell commo n stock short or participate in put and or call options 
these instruments do no t qualify for hedge accounting and therefore changes in such derivatives fai r value are recognized in earnings 
these derivatives are recorded as a componen t of accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company manufactures its products in the united states and mexico and sell s its products in those markets as well as in europe  south america and asia 
as a result  the company s operating results could be affected by factors such a s changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in th e foreign markets in which the company distributes its products 
most of th e company s sales are denominated in us dollars 
for the years ended decembe r   and   and of the net sales of the company s engineered products segment were denominated in euros  respectively 
as such  a portion of the company s receivables are exposed to fluctuations with the u 
s dollar 
however  the company does not believe this risk to be material to it s overall financial position 
since the euro has been relatively stable i n relation to the us dollar  the company s results have not been significantl y impacted by foreign exchange gains or losses in the past 
accordingly  th e company has not entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge this exposure if such exposure were to increase in the future  the company may reexamine thi s practice to minimize the associated risks the company has undertaken the completion of environmental studies and o r remedial action at metex two new jersey facilities and has recorded a liabilit y for the estimated investigation  remediation and administrative costs associate d therewith 
see environmental regulations in item of part i and note commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statement s for further discussion on this matter 
the company is subject to various other litigation  legal  regulatory and ta x matters that arise in the ordinary course of business activities 
whe n management believes it is probable that liabilities have been incurred and suc h amounts are reasonably estimable  the company provides for amounts that includ e judgments and penalties that may be assessed 
these liabilities are usuall y included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other long ter m liabilities in the consolidated financial statements  depending on th e anticipated payment date 
at december  and  the company ha d approximately million recorded in other long term liabilities relating t o such matters 
none of these matters are expected to result in a material advers e effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results o f operations 
previous purchases of the company s common stock have reduced the company s additional paid in capital to zero and  accordingly  any future purchases i n excess of par value will also reduce retained earnings 
future proceeds from th e issuance of common stock in excess of par value will be credited to retaine d earnings until such time that previously recorded reductions have bee n recovered 
the company has not purchased any shares of the company s commo n stock during repurchases of the company s common stock may be made fro m time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices or in privatel y negotiated transactions  subject to available resources

related party transactions the company has a interest in an unconsolidated limited liabilit y corporation  whose principal assets are two distribution centers leased t o kmart 
a group that includes the wife of the company s board chairman  tw o directors of the company and the wife of one of the directors has an interes t in this entity 
the company s share of income arising from this investment accounted for as a leveraged lease  was   and  for th e years ended december   and  respectively 
the company s two hotel properties  as well as the hotels owned by the hote l venture and quebec venture as hereinafter defined  are managed by brep i v hotel llc brep  the successor to prime hospitality corp 
prime 
th e company s board chairman and another director were directors and or an executiv e officer of prime prior to its sale to brep 
fees paid for the management of th e company s two hotel properties are based upon a percentage of revenue and wer e approximately   and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company has a interest in two joint ventures which each own and operat e a hotel 
the hotels are located in new jersey the hotel venture and quebec canada the quebec venture 
the new jersey hotel secures a millio n mortgage loan the mortgage with a bank 
in connection with the mortgage  th e company and prime  who also holds a interest in each of the joint ventures entered into a direct guaranty agreement with the bank whereby they  jointly an d severally  guaranteed not more than million of the mortgage 
amounts du e under the guaranty are reduced by the scheduled principal payments under th e mortgage 
the guaranty is enforceable upon the occurrence of certain events including a default as defined in the mortgage  and expires upon satisfaction o f the loan in april pursuant to the operating agreement  any payments mad e under the guaranty would increase the guarantors ownership interest 
th e company believes that the collateral of the underlying hotel is sufficient t o repay the mortgage without requiring enforcement of the guaranty 
accordingly the fair value of the guarantee was determined to be insignificant and therefore  no liability has been recorded 
critical accounting policies and management estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance wit h accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of americ a requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions tha t affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  an d related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
certain of th e estimates and assumptions required to be made relate to matters that ar e inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events 
while management believe s that the estimates and assumptions used were the most appropriate  actua l results could differ significantly from those estimates under differen t assumptions and conditions 
the following is a description of those accountin g policies believed by management to require subjective and complex judgment s which could potentially affect reported results 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable real estate investment an d management the company leases substantially all of its properties to tenants under ne t leases which are accounted for as operating leases 
under this type of lease the tenant is obligated to pay all operating costs of the property includin g real estate taxes  insurance and repairs and maintenance 
revenue is recognize d as earned and deemed collectible 
the effect of stepped rent increases o n significant leases are recorded  net of allowances  on a straight line basis gains on sales of real estate assets and equity investments are recorded whe n the gain recognition criteria under generally accepted accounting principles i n the united states of america have been met 
the company does not have leases that include significant rent concessions o r provisions that require the lessee to fund capital improvements or to pay th e lessor any revenues based upon indexes or rates that are not explicitly state d in the lease 
reimbursements of certain costs received from tenants are recognized as tenan t reimbursement revenues 
certain lease agreements provide for additional rent based on a percentage o f tenants sales 
these percentage rents are recorded once the required sale s levels are achieved 
income on leveraged leases is recognized by a method that produces a constan t rate of return on the outstanding investment in the lease  net of the relate d deferred tax liability  in the years in which the net investment is positive 
accounts receivable are recorded at the outstanding amounts  net of th e allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company makes estimates of th e uncollectibility of its accounts receivable related to base rents  tenan t escalations  expense reimbursements and other revenues 
the company analyze s accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels  customer credit worthines s and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance fo r doubtful accounts 
in addition  tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimate s are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre petition an d post petition claims 
the company s net income is directly affected b y management s estimate of the collectibility of accounts receivable 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable engineered products in general  sales are recorded when products are shipped  title has passed an d collection is reasonably assured 
management believes that adequate controls ar e in place to ensure compliance with contractual product specifications  a substantial history of such performance has been established and historica l returns and allowances have not been significant 
if actual sales returns an d allowances exceed historical amounts  the company s sales would be adversel y affected 
accounts receivable are recorded at the outstanding amounts  net of th e allowance for doubtful accounts 
estimates are used in determining the company s allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical collections experience current economic trends and a percentage of its accounts receivable by agin g category 
in determining these percentages  the company looks at historica l write offs of its receivables 
the company also looks at the credit quality o f its customer base as well as changes in its credit policies 
the compan y continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers 
while credi t losses have historically been within expectations and the provision s established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experienc e the same credit loss rates that it has in the past 
the company s net income i s directly affected by management s estimate of the collectibility of account s receivable 
marketable securities the company determines the appropriate classification of marketable securitie s at the time of purchase and reassesses the appropriateness of the classificatio n at each reporting date 
at december  and  all marketable securitie s held by the company have been classified as available for sale and  as a result are stated at fair value  based on quoted market prices 
unrealized gains an d losses on available for sale securities are recorded as a separate component o f stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses on the sale of securities  a s determined on a first in  first out basis  are included in the consolidate d statements of income 
the company reviews its investments on a regular basis to evaluate whether o r not each security has experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value if it is believed that an other than temporary decline exists  the company wil l write down the investment to market value and record the related write down as a loss in the consolidated statements of income 
the company s net income is directly affected by management s classification o f marketable securities  as well as its determination of whether a n other than temporary decline in the value of its investments exists 
inventories the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market  cost bein g determined on a first in  first out basis 
the company regularly review s inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolet e inventory based primarily on existing and anticipated design and engineerin g changes to its products as well as forecasts of future product demand 
th e company s net income is directly affected by management s estimate of th e realizability of inventories 
real estate land  buildings and improvements and equipment are recorded at cost  les s accumulated depreciation and amortization 
expenditures for maintenance an d repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
significant renovations an d replacements  which improve the life of the asset  are capitalized an d depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
depreciation is computed utilizing the straight line method over the estimate d useful lives of to years for buildings  ten to years for renovation s and improvements and five to years for equipment and fixtures 
assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fai r value less costs to sell and depreciation is discontinued 
property sales o r dispositions are recorded when title transfers 
upon disposition  the relate d costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts 
an y gain or loss on sale or disposition is recognized in accordance with accountin g principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in the norma l course of business  the company receives offers for the sale of properties either solicited or unsolicited 
for those offers that are accepted  th e prospective buyer usually requires a due diligence period before consummation o f the transaction 
it is not unusual for matters to arise that result in th e withdrawal or rejection of the offer during this process 
if circumstances aris e that previously were considered unlikely and  as a result  management decide s not to sell a property classified as held for sale  the property is reclassifie d as held for rental 
a property that is reclassified is measured and recorde d individually at the lower of its carrying amount before being classified as hel d for sale  adjusted for any depreciation expense that would have been recognize d had the property been continuously classified as held for rental or its fai r market value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives o f its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflec t on an annual basis with respect to those properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income 
should the company adjust th e expected useful life of a particular asset  it would be depreciated over th e adjusted years  and result in a revised depreciation expense and net income 
discontinued operations the company is required to make certain subjective assessments utilizing th e provisions of sfas no 
in determining whether a long lived asset to b e disposed of should be reclassified as discontinued operations 
the compan y considers real property to be held for sale and reported as discontinue d operations if management commits to a plan to sell the asset under usual an d customary terms and believes such sale will be completed within one year 
i n such event  the financial results associated with these assets are reclassifie d as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
although operating income income from continuing operations and income from discontinued operations ar e directly affected by management s assessments  the reclassification has n o impact on net income 
long lived assets on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators tha t the value of its long lived assets may be impaired 
an asset s value i s considered impaired only if management s estimate of current and projecte d operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the asse t over its remaining useful life is less than the net carrying value of the asset such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operatin g income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition an d other factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the carrying amount of th e asset would be written down to an amount to reflect the fair value of the asset the company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there ar e impairments in the value of its long lived assets and other investments 
th e company s net income is directly affected by management s estimate o f impairments 
in determining impairment  if any  the company has adopted sfas no pension plan pension plans can be a significant cost of doing business  but represen t obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and therefore ar e subject to estimates 
pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognitio n of future benefit costs over the employee s approximate service period based o n the terms of the plan and the investment and funding decisions made by th e company 
the company is required to make assumptions regarding such variables a s the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied t o determine service cost and interest cost to arrive at pension income or expens e for the year 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plan in accordance wit h sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas no 
 whic h requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on a n actuarial basis 
sfas no 
generally reduces the volatility of future incom e expense from changes in pension liability discount rates and the performanc e of the pension plan s assets 
the most significant element in determining the company s pension incom e expense in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets the company has assumed that the expected long term rate of return on pla n assets to be in each of the last three years 
based on the company s existin g and forecasted asset allocation and related long term investment performanc e results  the company believes that its assumption of future returns of i s reasonable 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value o f plan assets in a systematic manner 
this produces the expected return on pla n assets that is included in pension income expense 
the difference between thi s expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the ne t deferral of past asset gains losses affects the calculated value of pla n assets and  ultimately  future pension income expense 
a basis poin t change in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would hav e changed fiscal pension expense by  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from th e potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result o f fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates and in equity and commodit y prices 
derivative financial instruments are used by the company principally i n the hedging of overall market risks and the management of its interest rat e exposure 
the primary objective of the company s investment activities is to preserv e principal and maximize yields without significantly increasing market risk 
t o achieve this  management maintains a portfolio of cash equivalents an d investments in a variety of securities  primarily us investments in bot h common and preferred equity issues 
funds of the company in excess of those needed for working capital  purchasin g real estate and arranging financing for real estate acquisitions are invested b y the company in corporate equity securities  corporate notes  certificates o f deposit  government securities and other financial instruments 
changes in u 
s interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash and cas h equivalent balances and other interest bearing investments 
although interes t rates have begun to rise  given the level of cash and other interest bearin g investments currently held by the company and the decline in us interest rate s over the past several years  the company s earnings have been negativel y impacted 
the company s marketable securities consist of us investments in both commo n and preferred equity issues and are subject to the fluctuations in us stoc k markets 
most of the company s mortgages payable are fixed rate an d self amortizing from the net cash flow of the underlying properties 
th e company s derivative instruments primarily consist of put and or call options such derivatives are subject to the fluctuations in us stock markets 
the company manufactures its products in the united states and mexico and sell s its products in those markets as well as in europe  south america and asia 
as a result  the company s operating results could be affected by factors such a s changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in th e foreign markets in which the company distributes its products 
most of th e company s sales are denominated in us dollars 
for the years ended decembe r   and   and of the net sales of the company s engineered products segment were denominated in euros  respectively 
as such  a portion of the company s receivables are exposed to fluctuations with the u 
s dollar 
however  the company does not believe this risk to be material to it s overall financial position 
since the euro has been relatively stable i n relation to the us dollar  the company s results have not been significantl y impacted by foreign exchange gains or losses in the past 
accordingly  th e company has not entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge this exposure if such exposure were to increase in the future  the company may reexamine thi s practice to minimize the associated risks 
the company s manufacturing operations utilize various metal commoditie s principally stainless steel in the manufacturing process 
while key metal s purchased from foreign entities are generally denominated in us dollars fluctuations in the suppliers local currencies may impact pricing 
the compan y is unable to quantify the effects of such fluctuations  however  it does ente r into purchase commitments for certain key metals that generally do not excee d twelve months which tends to minimize short term currency fluctuations 
th e company s financial results  however  could be significantly affected b y fluctuations in metals pricing

forward looking statements certain statements in this annual report on form k and other statements mad e by the company or its representatives that are not strictly historical facts ar e forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securitie s litigation reform act of that should be considered as subject to the man y risks and uncertainties that exist in the company s operations and busines s environment 
the forward looking statements are based on current expectation s and involve a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties that coul d cause the actual results  performance and or achievements of the company t o differ materially from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied  by the forward looking statements 
readers are cautione d not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  and that i n light of the significant uncertainties inherent in forward looking statement s the inclusion of such statements should not be regarded as a representation b y the company or any other person that the objectives or plans of the company wil l be achieved 
the company also assumes no obligation to publicly update or revis e its forward looking statements or to advise of changes in the assumptions an d factors on which they are based 
the following are some of the risks that coul d cause actual results to differ significantly from those expressed or implied b y such statements our performance is subject to risks associated with the real estate industry 
although the company s leases are generally long term and may be below market real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk and ar e relatively illiquid 
among the factors that may impact our real estate propert y values or the revenues derived from our portfolio are changes in the national regional and local economic climate  the attractiveness of our properties t o tenants  competition from other available property owners and changes in marke t rental rates 
our performance also depends on the financial condition of ou r tenants and our ability to collect rent from tenants and to pay for adequat e maintenance  insurance and other operating costs  including real estate taxes which could increase over time 
also  the expenses of owning and operating a property are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factor s and competition cause a reduction in income from the property 
our results could be negatively affected by delinquencies in our mortgage o r high yield loan receivables 
on a limited basis we provide high yield  short term mortgage loans that w e believe are collateralized by desirable properties at substantial value to loa n ratios 
in addition  we have provided purchase money notes to buyers of certai n real estate properties 
although we believe that the collateral for these loan s is sufficient to recover its carrying value  changes in the real estate marke t in the locale in which the property is located or delinquencies by the borrowe r could negatively affect our carrying value for these loans and  ultimately  ou r results of operations and cash flows 
off balance sheet obligations could deplete our liquidity and capital resources we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that we believe are reasonabl y likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
the debt of the join t ventures in which we have an ownership interest are non recourse obligations an d are collateralized by the entity s real property 
in one instance  we an d another partner have jointly and severally guaranteed not more than millio n of the joint venture s mortgage obligation 
we believe that with eac h arrangement the value of the underlying property and its operating cash flow s are sufficient to satisfy its obligations 
in addition  except for th e guarantee  we are not obligated for the debts of the joint ventures 
however  w e could decide to satisfy the debts of the joint venture to protect ou r investment 
in such event  our capital resources and financial condition woul d be reduced and  in certain instances  the carrying value of our investment an d our results of operations would be negatively impacted 
our markets are highly competitive 
the markets for our engineered products are highly competitive 
we cannot assur e that we will be able to successfully compete or that our competitors will no t develop new technologies and products that are more commercially effective tha n our own 
some of our competitors have financial  technical  marketing  sales an d distribution resources greater than ours 
our engineered products segment relies on significant customers 
the company sells its engineered products to many customers throughout th e world 
historically  a small number of customers accounted for significan t portions of these sales 
for the year ended december   sales by th e engineered products segment to general motors  its largest customer  accounte d for of the segment s sales 
since our engineered products segmen t accounted for of our consolidated revenues for  the loss of genera l motors as a customer would adversely affect our revenues and results o f operations 
an interruption in the supply  or a significant increase in the cost  of our ra w materials could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  results o f operations and cash flows 
the principal raw materials used in the company s engineered products busines s are stainless steel wire and steel related products  which are typicall y purchased from multiple suppliers throughout the world 
the price an d availability of raw materials can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond ou r control  including general domestic and international economic conditions  labo r costs  supply and demand  competition  import duties and tariffs and currenc y exchange rates 
these factors could significantly affect the availability an d cost of our raw materials which are generally purchased at levels that w e believe will satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upo n contractual commitments  historical buying practices and market conditions 
w e may be unable to recover raw material cost increases due to contractual o r competitive conditions 
conversely  reductions in raw material prices coul d result in lower sales prices for our products and lower margins as we utiliz e existing inventories 
therefore  changing raw material costs could significantl y impact our revenues  gross margins  operating and net income 
if  in the future we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of stainless steel wire or othe r critical raw materials on a timely basis and at competitive prices  we may b e unable to fulfill our customers requirements  which could have a materia l adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations an d cash flows 
protection of our intellectual property is limited  we are subject to the ris k of third party claims of infringement 
our engineered products business relies in large part upon our proprietar y scientific and engineering know how and production techniques 
historically patents have not been an important part of our protection of our intellectua l property rights 
we rely upon the laws regarding unfair competition restrictions in licensing agreements and confidentiality agreements to protec t our intellectual property 
we limit access to and distribution of ou r proprietary information 
our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth wil l depend  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology an d operate without infringing upon the rights of others 
we are not currentl y involved in any litigation regarding the infringement upon our intellectua l property or regarding our infringement upon the intellectual property of others our operations are subject to environmental regulation and environmenta l problems which are possible and can be costly 
our engineered products segment is subject to a variety of federal  state an d local governmental regulations relating to the storage  discharge  handling emission  generation  manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardou s substances used to manufacture our products 
we believe that we are currently i n compliance in all material respects with such regulations and that we hav e obtained all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business nevertheless  the failure to comply with current or future regulations coul d result in the imposition of fines  suspension of production  alteration of ou r manufacturing processes or cessation of operations 
federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of th e environment require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate t o investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances at such property 
we have undertaken the completion of environmental studies and or remedia l action at metex two new jersey facilities and have recorded a liability for th e estimated investigation  remediation and administrative costs associat e therewith see environment regulations in item of part i and note commitments and contingences of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company may revise such estimates in the future due to the uncertaint y regarding the nature  timing and extent of any remediation efforts that may b e required at these sites  should an appropriate regulatory agency deem suc h efforts to be necessary 
the estimates may also be revised as new or additiona l information in these matters becomes available or should the njdep or othe r regulatory agencies require additional or alternative remediation efforts in th e future 
although we do not expect such events to significantly change ou r estimates  adverse decisions or events  particularly as to the merits of ou r factual and legal basis  could cause us to change our estimate of liability wit h respect to such matters in the future 
accordingly  we are unable to predic t whether our estimate of future remediation costs will materially increase in th e future
