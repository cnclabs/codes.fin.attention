management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction lehman brothers holdings inc holdings and subsidiaries collectively  the company  lehman brothers  we  us or our is one of the leading global investment banks  serving institutional  corporate  government and high net worth individual clients and customers 
our worldwide headquarters in new york and regional headquarters in london and tokyo are complemented by offices in additional locations in north america  europe  the middle east  latin america and the asia pacific region 
through our subsidiaries  we are a global market maker in all major equity and fixed income products 
to facilitate our market making activities  we are a member of all principal securities and commodities exchanges in the us  and we hold memberships or associate memberships on several principal international securities and commodities exchanges including the london  tokyo  hong kong  frankfurt  milan  australian and paris stock exchanges 
our principal businesses are investment banking  capital markets and investment management which  by their nature  are subject to volatility primarily due to changes in interest and foreign exchange rates  valuation of financial instruments and real estate  global economic and political trends and industry competition 
through our investment banking  trading  research  structuring and distribution capabilities in equity and fixed income products we continue to build on our customer flow business model  which focuses on customer flow activities 
the customer flow model is based on our principal focus of facilitating client transactions in all major global capital markets products and services 
we generate customer flow revenues from institutional  corporate  government and high net worth customers by i advising on and structuring transactions specifically suited to meet client needs  ii serving as a market maker and or intermediary in the global marketplace  including having securities and other financial instrument products available to allow clients to rebalance their portfolios and diversify risks across different market cycles  iii providing investment management and advisory services  and iv acting as an underwriter to clients 
as part of our customer flow activities  we maintain inventory positions of varying amounts across a broad range of financial instruments that are marked to market daily and  along with proprietary trading positions  give rise to principal transactions and net interest revenue 
the financial services industry is significantly influenced by worldwide economic conditions as well as other factors inherent in the global financial markets 
as a result  revenues and earnings may vary from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
all references to the years  and in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a refer to our fiscal years ended november   and  or the last day of such fiscal years  as the context requires  unless specifically stated otherwise 
forward looking statements some of the statements contained in this md a  including those relating to our strategy and other statements that are predictive in nature  that depend on or refer to future events or conditions or that include words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates and similar expressions  are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these statements are not historical facts but instead represent only management s expectations  estimates and projections regarding future events 
similarly  these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve uncertainties that are difficult to predict  which may include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed under certain factors affecting results of operations below 
as a global investment bank  our results of operations have varied significantly in response to global economic and market trends and geopolitical events 
the nature of our business makes predicting the future trends of revenues or financial condition difficult 
caution should be used when extrapolating historical results or conditions to future periods 
our actual results and financial condition may differ  perhaps materially  from the anticipated results and financial condition in any such forward looking statements and  accordingly  readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
certain factors affecting results of operations our financial condition and results of operations may be affected by uncertain or unfavorable economic  market  legal and other conditions 
these conditions include but are not limited to market risk changes in interest and foreign exchange rates  financial instruments and real estate valuations and increases in volatility can increase credit and market risks and may also affect customer flow related revenues and proprietary trading revenues as well as affect the volume of debt and equity underwritings and merger and acquisition transactions 
we use derivatives and other financial contracts to hedge many of these market risks 
competitive environment all aspects of our business are highly competitive 
our competitive ability depends on many factors  including our reputation  the quality of our services and advice  intellectual capital  product innovation  execution ability  pricing  and sales efforts and the talent of our personnel 
see part i  item business competition in this annual report on form k the form k for more information about competitive matters 
investor sentiment accounting and corporate governance scandals in recent years have had a significant effect on investor confidence 
in addition  concerns about geopolitical developments and oil prices  among other things  can affect the global financial markets 
see executive overview business environment and economic outlook in this md a for additional information 
liquidity liquidity and liquidity management are of critical importance in our industry 
liquidity could be affected by the inability to access the long term or short term debt  repurchase or securities lending markets or to draw under credit facilities  whether due to factors specific to us or to general market conditions 
in addition  the amount and timing of uncertain events  such as unfunded commitments and contingencies  could adversely affect cash requirements and liquidity 
to mitigate these risks  our liquidity and funding policies have been conservatively designed to maintain sufficient liquid financial resources to continually fund our balance sheet and to meet all expected cash outflows  for one year in a stressed liquidity environment 
see liquidity  funding and capital resources liquidity risk management in this md a for more information 
credit ratings our access to the unsecured funding markets is dependent on our credit ratings 
a reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our access to liquidity alternatives and our competitive position  and could increase the cost of funding or trigger additional collateral requirements 
see liquidity  funding and capital resources credit ratings in this md a for more information 
credit exposure credit exposure represents the possibility a counterparty will be unable to honor its contractual obligations 
although we actively manage credit exposure daily as part of our risk management framework  counterparty default risk may arise from unforeseen events or circumstances 
operational risk operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal or outsourced processes  people  infrastructure and technology  or from external events 
we minimize these risks through our strong internal control environment 
legal and regulatory the securities and financial services industries are subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws in the us and under the laws of the many other jurisdictions in which we do business 
we also are regulated by a number of self regulatory organizations such as the national association of securities dealers  the municipal securities rulemaking board and the national futures association  and by national securities and commodities exchanges  including the new york stock exchange 
violation of applicable regulations could result in legal and or administrative proceedings  which may impose censures  fines  cease and desist orders or suspension of a firm  its officers or employees 
the scrutiny of the financial services industry has increased  which has led to increased regulatory investigations and litigation against financial services firms 
legislation and rules adopted both in the us and around the world have imposed substantial new or more stringent regulations  internal practices  procedures and controls and disclosure requirements in such areas as financial reporting  corporate governance  auditor independence  equity compensation plans  restrictions on the interaction between equity research analysts and investment banking personnel and money laundering 
the trend and scope of increased compliance requirements may require us to invest in additional resources to ensure compliance 
we are involved in a number of judicial  regulatory and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of our business  including actions brought against us and others with respect to transactions in which we acted as an underwriter or financial advisor  actions arising out of our activities as a broker or dealer in securities and actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants against many securities firms and lending institutions  including us

executive overview summary of results net income totaled billion  billion and million in  and  respectively  up and from the corresponding and periods 
the results represent the highest net revenues  net income and earnings per share ever reported  with improved revenues in each of our three business segments and in each geographic region 
diluted earnings per share were  and in  and  respectively  up and from the corresponding and periods 
during  we continued to strengthen our franchise 
in investment banking we gained significant market share in key activities such as mergers and acquisitions m a and equity origination  while maintaining our considerable share in fixed income origination 
in capital markets we continued to broaden our client base  offer best in class research services to our clients and invest in technology to bring superior execution to our clients 
we also expanded our capital markets mortgage origination platform through several business acquisitions 
in investment management we continued to grow our various platforms by broadening our product offerings  enhancing performance and service levels and increasing our scale 
in addition  we have successfully integrated our acquisitions of neuberger  the crossroads group crossroads and lincoln capital management lincoln 
as a firm  we continue to invest in our infrastructure and facilities while maintaining our strict discipline around expenses  risk  and capital and liquidity management 
business environment as a global investment bank  our results of operations have varied significantly in response to global economic and market trends and geopolitical events 
a favorable business environment is characterized by many factors  including a stable geopolitical climate  transparent financial markets  low inflation  low interest rates  low unemployment  strong business profitability  and high business and investor confidence 
these factors influence levels of debt and equity security issuance and merger and acquisition activity  which affect our investment banking business  trading volumes and valuations in secondary financial markets  which affect our capital markets businesses  and workforce wealth creation  which affects both our capital markets and investment management businesses 
the global business environment in was mixed but generally favorable compared with recent years due to a combination of factors including positive economic growth  improved corporate profitability  stronger equity markets and low interest rates 
the european and japanese economies cooled as the year progressed  while activity in the us remained vibrant 
the market environment in the second half of became challenging  extending beyond the seasonal summer slowdown to incorporate a series of headline and event risk items that elevated the level of market uncertainty and held equity trading volumes and volatility down 
the federal reserve fed raised interest rates basis points in each of june  august  september and november and again in december  matching the markets expectations of a measured approach to monetary policy 
the bank of england also raised rates during the year  while the european central bank held rates unchanged 
while these developments were consistent with expectations  a host of uncertainties weighed on the market for much of the year 
continued turmoil in the middle east elevated geopolitical risk  and the possibility of terrorism hung over the athens olympic games and the political conventions and elections in the us increased oil demand and constrained supply elevated the price of oil to all time highs  fueled in part by supply disruptions in the middle east  events in russia  the venezuelan referendum and speculative activity 
election year politics in the us further raised market uncertainty  particularly with respect to future us foreign  tax and fiscal policy 
however  the quick resolution of the us presidential election  coupled with stronger payroll data and declining oil prices touched off rallies in both the equity and fixed income markets 
the s p  dow jones industrial and nasdaq indices rose  and  respectively  in the year ended november   with much of this growth occurring in the first and fourth quarters 
the european recovery  evident in  continued modestly through in the european equity markets  the ftse and the dax composite rose and  respectively  from november  the economies in asia excluding japan performed strongly in  underpinned by the synchronized global economic recovery and accommodative domestic macroeconomic policies 
japan s economy continues to recover  although deflation remains a persistent threat  which could result in yen depreciation 
against this backdrop  the nikkei and hang seng indices rose and  respectively  compared with november  equity markets 
the us equity markets in reflected lower volumes and volatility compared with monthly average trading volumes on the nasdaq declined while volumes on the new york stock exchange rose compared with in europe volumes were broadly comparable to  while in asia volumes increased significantly 
equity offerings improved significantly compared with  reflecting improved market dynamics and higher valuations 
the overall volume of initial public offerings ipos nearly tripled compared with as the global economy continued to grow and companies required more capital for expansion 
the improvement in ipo and secondary activity helped to offset a significant decline in convertible offerings 
fixed income markets 
despite the fed s shift in february from maintaining a low interest rate environment for a considerable period to a measured approach of raising rates beginning in june  interest rates remained low in both absolute and relative terms  and the fixed income markets overall remained strong 
certain credit asset classes experienced lower volatility and trading volumes during the year 
total global debt origination rose in fiscal compared with as growth in investment grade and high yield origination totaling and  respectively  was partially offset by declines in mortgage backed and agency origination of and  respectively 
mergers and acquisitions 
the improvement in equity valuations during coupled with strengthening cash flows enabled companies to consider strategic acquisitions 
completed and announced m a volumes improved significantly compared with  reflecting strong liquidity  continued interest from financial sponsors and the cautious return of the strategic buyer 
during  global m a announcements rose compared with and completed m a transactions rose compared with economic outlook the financial services industry is significantly influenced by worldwide economic conditions in both banking and capital markets 
in calendar  we expect the us and asian excluding japan economies to grow at and rates  respectively  while we expect more moderate growth rates of and in europe and japan  respectively 
we believe the fed will raise rates an additional basis points  to by mid year enough to slow growth and quell inflation pressures without creating the risk of a hard landing 
inflation remains a top concern of the fed  even though price and wage pressures remain fairly muted 
measured fed tightening amid solid gross domestic product growth and low inflation should help to create a benign interest rate environment in calendar  as the capital markets have largely factored in expected rate increases 
we also anticipate the european central bank and bank of japan will remain on hold 
corporate profitability remains resilient  even though expectations have moderated compared with although we remain somewhat wary about geopolitical risk  the growing deficits in the us  and china s efforts to rein in growth  we see resiliency in the global economy as a whole 
equity markets 
the equity markets became more constructive in late after many of the uncertainties of the third and early fourth quarters played themselves out 
after a round of postponements and cancellations during the summer of  offering pipelines stabilized  and companies continue to seek to fund growth 
we expect the equity offering calendar to remain robust into furthermore  reasonably strong corporate profitability and a benign inflation outlook would increase confidence in the marketplace 
fixed income markets 
we see continued signs of resiliency in the fixed income markets attributable to the expected measured pace of interest rate increases  stable credit spreads  the amount of debt maturing in  and the expected increase in m a related financings 
fixed income activity is driven in part by absolute interest rates but also is highly correlated with the degree of volatility  the shape of the yield curve and the general improvement in credit quality which  in the aggregate  is contributing to a relatively healthy business environment 
the investor base has changed dramatically from the long only investors of a few years ago to a rapidly growing hedge fund  and an expanding international investor base 
investors now employ far more developed risk mitigation tools to manage their portfolios 
unlike in  the fed has been far more transparent in communicating its intentions  and the market successfully absorbed five rate hikes in calendar and rallied in the process 
in addition  the size and diversity of the global fixed income marketplace is significantly larger and broader than ever before and we expect approximately trillion of global fixed income origination in calendar  a slight decrease from trillion in calendar mergers and acquisitions 
companies remain interested in growth  and many have reduced their cost structures as far as possible 
during  we saw increased activity from strategic buyers  and we expect the m a fee pool in to grow compared with at the same time  as companies seek to streamline operations or reduce debt  many are divesting non core businesses  which is helping to drive m a opportunities 
asset management and high net worth 
our outlook for asset management and services to high net worth individuals is also positive  given favorable demographics and the trends toward pension reform  higher savings rates globally and intergenerational wealth transfer 
the high net worth client increasingly seeks multiple providers and greater asset diversification along with a high service component 
we believe the significant expansion of our asset management business  and the generally strong investment return performance of our asset managers in positions us well for growth in consolidated results of operations overview net revenues were billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively  up and from the corresponding and periods 
net income totaled billion  billion and million in  and  respectively  up and from the corresponding and periods 
diluted earnings per share were  and in  and  respectively  up and from the corresponding and periods 
the results represent the highest revenue  net income and earnings per share we have ever reported 
the results reflect the enhanced scale we have built in part by acquisitions and the diversification we have achieved  coupled with continuing strict discipline in our core competencies around managing expenses  risk and capital 
the results also reflect the benefits of the increased scale of our asset management business and the growth of our mortgage origination platform through several business acquisitions

interest and dividends revenue and interest expense rose and  respectively  in compared with attributable to higher levels of interest and dividend earning assets and interest bearing liabilities coupled with a modest upward shift in interest rates

interest and dividends revenue and interest expense declined and  respectively  in compared with  primarily due to substantial declines in interest rates 
investment banking investment banking revenues totaled billion in and billion in both and investment banking revenues result primarily from fees and related revenues earned for underwriting public and private offerings of fixed income and equity securities  advising clients on m a activities and corporate financing activities

business acquisitions and dispositions capital markets 
during  we acquired three mortgage banking platforms for an aggregate cost of approximately million

investment management 
in october  we purchased neuberger as part of our strategic plan to build out our investment management business segment 
the neuberger acquisition increased our revenues from fee based activities  allowing for reduced cross cycle earnings volatility 
the acquisition is providing revenue synergies by making neuberger products available to our network of institutional and high net worth individual clients in all three geographic regions and offering neuberger clients an expanded range of investment and risk management products  including structured capital markets products  private equity  and other alternative asset management products

in both the capital markets and investment management business segments we evaluate revenue performance based on the aggregate of principal transactions  commissions and net interest revenues  which includes realized and unrealized gains and losses  commissions associated with transactions and the interest and dividend revenue or expense associated with financing or hedging positions 
caution should be used when analyzing these revenue categories individually because they may not be indicative of the overall performance of the capital markets and investment management business segments

the following business segment discussions exclude the special items 
investment banking percent change in millions year ended november investment banking revenues    non interest expenses    income before taxes excludes the special items 
the investment banking business segment is made up of advisory services and global finance activities that serve our corporate and government clients 
the segment is organized into global industry groups communications  consumer retailing  financial institutions  financial sponsors  healthcare  industrial  media  natural resources  power  real estate and technology that include bankers who deliver industry knowledge and expertise to meet clients objectives 
specialized product groups within advisory services  including m a and restructuring  and within global finance  including equity capital markets  debt capital markets  leveraged finance  private placements  derivatives and product development  are partnered with relationship managers in the global industry groups to provide comprehensive financial solutions for clients 
investment banking revenues percent change in millions year ended november debt underwriting  equity underwriting merger and acquisition advisory revenues totaled billion in and billion in both and revenues increased in compared with  reflecting significant improvements in m a advisory and global equity underwriting activities 
our increased market share in these areas  together with industry wide market volume increases  provided the basis for the revenue increases 
industry wide debt origination volumes remained robust in  up from investment banking revenues in were essentially unchanged compared with  as lower equity underwriting and m a advisory revenues were largely offset by higher debt underwriting revenues 
debt underwriting revenues were a record in for the third consecutive year  rising compared with  despite challenging market conditions including rising interest rates  corporate pre funding in late and the rally of the global equity markets 
our global debt origination volumes in rose compared with  while industry wide global debt origination volumes rose in the same period  as clients continued to take advantage of low interest rates and tight credit spreads 
improved leveraged finance revenues in essentially offset a decline in high grade revenues 
our global debt origination ranking improved to number four for calendar  up from number five for calendar  while our market share declined slightly to in calendar compared with in calendar our debt origination fee backlog at november  of approximately million rose compared with november  however  debt origination fee backlog is generally less indicative of the level of future business due to the increased use of the shelf registration process 
debt underwriting revenues increased in compared with  as the tightening of credit spreads and a full year of historically low interest rates resulted in near record debt underwriting volumes 
industry wide fixed income origination volume rose in compared with  while our fixed income origination volume was up 
investment grade and high yield market underwriting volumes were particularly strong as credit spreads tightened in compared with the market volume growth in was largely in high grade debt  which generally has lower fee spreads 
our market share of global debt underwriting volumes in calendar of was up slightly from in calendar equity underwriting revenues grew in compared with as improved investor confidence and corporate profitability drove improved equity origination volumes 
industry wide equity origination volumes rose in compared with  while our equity origination volumes rose in the same period 
the results reflect strong growth in our volumes of ipos and secondary issuances while convertible underwritings were essentially unchanged compared with we substantially increased our global equity origination market share to in calendar compared with in calendar our equity related fee backlog for both filed and unfiled transactions at november  of approximately million rose compared with november  equity underwriting revenues declined in compared with primarily due to change in the mix of equity underwriting  with ipos  which generally are more lucrative  contributing only of market volume in  down from in industry wide global equity market volumes declined in compared with our global equity related market share increased slightly to in calendar from in calendar m a advisory fees rose in compared with  as we substantially improved our m a market position for completed transactions in calendar with a market share  up from a market share for calendar m a completed market transaction volumes increased in fiscal to their highest levels since  driven by an improving economy and higher stock market valuations 
activity from strategic buyers improved and sponsor activity  which accounts for a growing percentage of volumes  remained strong

net revenues rose in compared with on higher customer flow levels and reflect strong contributions from both fixed income and equities 
fixed income revenues improved in compared with as a favorable interest rate environment helped drive strength in mortgage originations and securitizations as well as interest rate products  and the declining dollar drove higher foreign exchange activity 
equities delivered improved revenues in compared with on higher customer flow levels  particularly in equity derivatives products and our prime broker business  as equity market valuations improved compared with capital markets net revenues in represent the fifth consecutive year of record performance in fixed income and the second highest revenue level in equities 
net revenues rose in compared with  reflecting strong growth in both fixed income and equities 
fixed income net revenues were a record billion  increasing in compared with market conditions were generally favorable in as evidenced by continued low interest rates  tightening credit spreads and volatile currency markets 
our diverse set of fixed income asset classes experienced improved results across a broad range of asset classes reflecting the increased scale and regional diversity of our business 
the mortgage securitization business was notably strong  with revenues in mortgage products benefiting from the low rate environment as well as the continued vertical integration of our mortgage origination platforms 
interest rate products benefited from robust customer flow activity as investors sought derivative hedging solutions amid an environment of increased interest rate volatility in the first half of foreign exchange revenues also rose as the us dollar weakened in the latter half of partially offsetting these increases were reduced contributions from credit products in compared with high grade credit products saw reduced customer flow activity as investors sought additional yield amid the further tightening of credit spreads 
high yield credit products benefited from the continued tightening of credit spreads in  although at a reduced level compared with record results 
fixed income net revenues increased in compared with as historically low interest rates  significant credit spread tightening  and volatile currency markets all contributed to a highly favorable environment for fixed income products and strong customer flow activities 
results improved across a broad range of asset classes in compared with including high yield  mortgage  interest rate  and municipal products 
high yield products had record results  driven by strong customer trading activities and improved proprietary position revenues

equities net revenues grew in compared with on higher customer flow levels  particularly in equity derivative products and our prime broker activities  as equity market valuations improved compared with derivative revenues were particularly strong  as customers increasingly used customized derivative products to hedge risk and reduce concentrations 
prime broker activity continued to benefit from growth in customer financing balances and an expanding client base  as total balances increased compared with november  the results also reflect higher private equity gains compared with these improvements were partially offset by lower revenues from our convertibles business due to a sharp drop in market volatility globally resulting in lower valuations on convertible debt coupled with a lower level of origination activity  which also affected secondary activity 
equities net revenues rose in compared with as improvements in the global economy and stronger corporate earnings fueled a steady improvement in global equity indices that began in march and continued through year end 
the rise in global equity indices contributed to improved performance in a number of asset classes including derivatives  convertibles  and private equity investments 
while us equity trading volumes declined slightly  european and asian markets experienced a rise in trading volumes contributing to improved performance in these regions 
derivatives benefited from improved customer flow activity  as customers increasingly used customized derivative products to hedge risk and reduce concentrations

the capital markets improvement reflects strong mortgage securitization and foreign exchange results as well as equity cash and derivatives results

investment banking revenue also grew  driven by our improved position in advisory activity  where our completed m a market share improved to in calendar compared with in calendar liquidity  funding and capital resources management s finance committee is responsible for developing  implementing and enforcing our liquidity  funding and capital policies 
these policies include recommendations for capital and balance sheet size as well as the allocation of capital and balance sheet to the business units 
through the establishment and enforcement of capital and funding limits  management s finance committee oversees compliance with policies and limits with the goal of ensuring we are not exposed to undue funding or liquidity risk 
liquidity risk management we view liquidity and liquidity management as critically important in our industry 
our funding strategy seeks to ensure we maintain sufficient liquid financial resources to continually fund our balance sheet and meet all of our funding obligations across all market environments 
our liquidity strategy is based on the following principles liquidity providers are credit and market sensitive and quick to react to any perceived market or firm specific risks 
consequently  we remain in a state of constant liquidity readiness 
during a liquidity event  certain secured lenders will require higher quality collateral  resulting in a lower availability of secured funding for hard to fund asset classes 
consequently  we rely on secured funding only to the extent we believe it would be available in all market environments 
a firm s legal entity structure may constrain liquidity 
some regulators or rating agency considerations may prevent the free flow of funds between the subsidiaries they supervise restricted subsidiaries and holdings and its other subsidiaries unrestricted subsidiaries 
consequently  we seek to ensure the restricted subsidiaries on the one hand  and holdings and its unrestricted subsidiaries collectively on the other  have sufficient stand alone liquidity and that there is no cross subsidization of liquidity from these restricted subsidiaries to holdings and its unrestricted subsidiaries 
for planning purposes  we do not assume that  in a liquidity crisis  assets can be sold to generate cash  unsecured debt can be issued or any cash and unencumbered liquid collateral outside of the liquidity pool can be used to support the liquidity of holdings and its unrestricted subsidiaries 
when managing liquidity  we pay particularly close attention to the size of our liquidity pool  our long term funding sources and requirements and our reliable secured funding capacity 
each of these measures is explained in more detail below 
liquidity pool 
our policy is to maintain a liquidity pool for holdings and its unrestricted subsidiaries that would cover  in a stressed liquidity environment  all expected cash outflows for one year 
this liquidity pool is invested in cash and unencumbered liquid collateral that can be monetized at short notice in all market environments to provide liquidity to holdings  which issues most of the unsecured debt 
at november   the estimated pledge value of this portfolio  along with the undrawn portion of holdings committed credit facility see liquidity  funding and capital resources credit facilities in this md a  totaled approximately billion 
cash and unencumbered liquid assets that are presumed to be trapped in a restricted subsidiary or required for operational purposes are not counted as available liquidity to holdings and its unrestricted subsidiaries 
our liquidity pool is expected to be available to cover expected cash outflows in a stressed liquidity environment including the repayment of all unsecured debt of holdings and its unrestricted subsidiaries maturing within twelve months billion at november  
we assume that  in a stressed liquidity environment  we will have no access to the unsecured debt market for a full year 
the drawdown of commitments to extend credit made by holdings and its unrestricted subsidiaries based on an analysis of the probability of such drawdown see summary of contractual obligations and commitments lending related commitments in this md a 
additional collateralization of derivative contracts and other secured funding arrangements by holdings and its unrestricted subsidiaries to counterparties that would be required in the event of a lowering of debt ratings see liquidity  funding and capital resources credit ratings in this md a 
the funding of anticipated equity repurchases as we manage our equity base including offsetting the dilutive effect of our employee incentive plans see liquidity  funding and capital resources stock repurchase program in this md a 
these projected outflows are re assessed weekly and as they change we adjust the size requirement for the liquidity pool 
the liquidity of the restricted subsidiaries is separately managed to comply with their applicable liquidity and capital requirements and to minimize dependence on holdings and its unrestricted subsidiaries 
in addition to our liquidity pool described above  we have a significant amount of additional unencumbered assets as a result of our business activities 
at november   the estimated pledge value of these unencumbered assets totaled approximately billion billion of which was held by restricted subsidiaries 
long term funding sources and requirements 
cash capital ie  stockholders equity and liabilities with remaining terms of over one year is a measure we use to assess our long term funding sources and requirements 
our policy is to operate with an excess of long term funding sources over our long term funding requirements 
in  we added materially to our cash capital sources ie  total stockholders equity and long term debt excluding current portion  other liabilities with remaining terms greater than one year and deposit liabilities at our banking institutions  lehman brothers bank  fsb lbb and lehman brothers bankhaus ag lbbag 
these regulated bank entities operate in a deposit protected environment and are able to source low cost unsecured funds that are generally insulated from a company specific or market liquidity event  thereby providing a reliable funding source for the mortgage products and selected loan assets they fund 
we also consider the undrawn portion of our committed facilities at holdings and lbbag as a source of cash capital because  in contrast to regular backstop facilities  which remain undrawn  these facilities are drawn as part of our regular funding typically to of the time see liquidity  funding and capital resources credit facilities in this md a 
at november  and  we had cash capital sources of billion and billion  respectively  across all legal entities the majority of it being long term debt 
cash capital sources in billions november total stockholders equity preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption long term debt  excluding current portion core deposit liabilities at lbb and lbbag other long term secured obligations undrawn portion of unsecured committed facilities total cash capital sources cash capital is used to fund the following long term funding requirements less liquid assets  such as fixed assets and goodwill 
less liquid inventory  such as high yield loans  private equity investments  commercial mortgages and certain real estate positions 
unencumbered inventory  irrespective of collateral quality 
unencumbered inventory outside of restricted subsidiaries  unless intentionally held as part of the liquidity pool  is conservatively assumed to be unfundable on a secured basis due to operation inefficiencies for example  because it is in transit between depots 
we do not assume we can improve operational effectiveness during a liquidity event and therefore intentionally fund all unencumbered positions that are not boxed with cash capital 
secured funding haircuts ie  the difference between the market value of the available inventory and the value of cash advanced to us by counterparties against that inventory 
operational cash deposited at banks 
liquid investments held to fund certain projected cash outflows as described in liquidity  funding and capital resources liquidity pool in this md a 
these investments are managed as part of the liquidity pool 
at november  and  we had billion and billion  respectively  of cash capital surpluses across all legal entities 
of the billion in cash capital surplus at november   billion is available to holdings and its unrestricted subsidiaries 
we target maintaining a cash capital surplus available to holdings and its unrestricted subsidiaries of not less than billion 
reliable secured funding capacity 
we have adopted what management believes to be a conservative approach to secured funding by depending on it only to the extent it is deemed reliable in all market environments 
we regularly perform a detailed assessment of our secured funding capacity by asset class and by counterparty to determine how much is reliable in a stressed liquidity environment 
reliable secured funding capacity usually is set at a significant discount to normal funding capacity 
in particular  less liquid inventory such as high yield loans and commercial mortgages are funded entirely with cash capital any short term secured funding that might exist for these asset classes in a normal market environment is not considered to be reliable 
contingency funding plan 
we have developed and regularly update a contingency funding plan  which represents a detailed action plan to manage a stress liquidity event  including a communication plan for creditors  investors and clients 
the contingency plan considers two types of liquidity stress events a company specific event  where there are no issues with the overall market liquidity  but stress on our company liquidity  and a broader market wide event  which affects not just our company but the entire market 
in a company specific event  we assume we would lose access to the unsecured funding market for a full year and have to rely on the large liquidity pool available to holdings and its unrestricted subsidiaries to continue to fund our balance sheet 
minimizing refinancing risk in our debt portfolio by limiting maturity and investor concentration and using conservative assumptions regarding cash capital required to meet funding requirements are our principal liquidity risk mitigants in these circumstances 
in a market liquidity event  in addition to the pressure of a company specific event  we also assume that  because the event is market wide  counterparties to whom we have extended liquidity facilities draw on these facilities 
to mitigate the effect of a market liquidity event we have developed access to additional liquidity sources beyond the liquidity pool at holdings 
these sources include unutilized funding capacity in our banks  lbb and lbbag  special funding vehicles pre funded with short term liquid instruments  and unutilized capacity in bilateral bank facilities described under credit facilities below 
we perform regular assessments of our funding requirements in stress liquidity scenarios to ensure we can meet all our funding obligations in all market environments 
funding and capital resources we believe total capital defined as long term debt plus total stockholders equity is useful to investors as a measure of our financial strength because it aggregates our long term funding sources 
total capital in millions november long term debt senior notes   subordinated indebtedness   subtotal   preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption  stockholders equity preferred stockholders equity   common stockholders equity   subtotal   total capital   includes billion of junior subordinated debentures at november  we adopted fin r effective february   which required us to deconsolidate trusts that issue preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption 
accordingly  at february  and subsequent period ends  subordinated indebtedness includes junior subordinated debentures that at november  and prior period ends were classified as preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption 
see accounting and regulatory developments in this md a and note to the consolidated financial statements 
our total capital increased to billion at november  compared with billion at november  the increase in total capital primarily resulted from a net increase in long term debt and increased equity from the retention of earnings 
total stockholders equity plus junior subordinated debentures totaled billion and billion at november  and  respectively 
we believe total stockholders equity plus junior subordinated debentures to be a more meaningful measure of our equity because the junior subordinated debentures are subordinated and have a maturity at issuance of years and we can defer interest payments for up to consecutive quarters if the junior subordinated debentures are not in default 
in addition  a leading rating agency views these securities as equity capital for purposes of calculating net leverage 
see liquidity  funding and capital resources balance sheet and financial leverage in this md a and note to the consolidated financial statements 
we actively manage long term debt to minimize refinancing risk and investor concentration 
we set limits for the amount maturing over any three  six and twelve month horizon at  and of outstanding long term debt  respectively that is  billion  billion and billion  respectively  at november  if we were to operate with debt above these levels  we would not include the additional amount as a source of cash capital 
we seek to diversify our creditor base when issuing unsecured debt 
the quarterly long term debt maturity schedule over the next five years at november  is as follows long term debt maturity profile graphic extendibles are debt instruments with an extendible maturity date  ie  unless debt holders instruct us to redeem their debt  the earliest maturity date of these instruments is automatically extended 
extendibles are included in long term debt if the earliest maturity date is at least one year away 
based on past experience  we expect the majority of these extendibles to remain outstanding beyond their earliest maturity date and roll through the long term debt maturity profile 
during  we issued billion of long term debt billion of senior notes and billion of subordinated indebtedness 
these issuances were approximately billion in excess of maturing long term debt billion in excess of senior notes  partially offset by billion net repayments of subordinated indebtedness 
on february   we reclassified to subordinated indebtedness billion of junior subordinated debentures that at november  was classified as preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption 
see accounting and regulatory developments in this md a and note to the consolidated financial statements 
long term debt increased to billion at november  from billion at november  and had weighted average maturities of years and years at november  and  respectively 
in addition  we issued billion of floating rate cumulative preferred stock  series g  in holdings may redeem such preferred stock on or after february  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our preferred stock 
we also formed one trust in to which we issued billion of junior subordinated debentures  maturing in  which is redeemable beginning in see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about junior subordinated debentures 
credit facilities we maintain a revolving credit agreement the credit agreement with a syndicate of banks under which the banks have committed to provide up to billion through april the credit agreement contains covenants that require  among other things  that we maintain a specified level of tangible net worth 
we also maintain a billion multi currency unsecured committed revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks for lbbag the facility 
the facility has a term of three and a half years expiring on april  there were no borrowings outstanding under either the credit agreement or the facility at november   although drawings have been made under both and repaid from time to time during the year 
cash flows cash and cash equivalents declined billion at november  compared with november   as net cash used in operating activities of billion attributable primarily to growth in secured financing activities coupled with net cash used in investing activities of million exceeded net cash provided by financing activities of billion 
cash and cash equivalents increased by billion at november  compared with november   as net cash provided by operating activities of billion and net cash provided by financing activities of billion exceeded net cash used in investing activities of billion 
balance sheet and financial leverage assets 
our balance sheet consists primarily of cash and cash equivalents  securities and other inventory positions owned  and collateralized financing agreements 
the liquid nature of these assets provides us with flexibility in financing and managing our business 
the majority of these assets are funded on a secured basis through collateralized financing agreements 
our total assets at november  increased billion to billion at november  compared with billion at november   primarily due to an increase in secured financing transactions and net assets 
our net assets at november  increased billion compared with november   primarily due to increases in corporate debt and mortgages and mortgage backed inventory positions 
we believe net assets is a more useful measure than total assets to investors when comparing companies in the securities industry because it excludes certain assets considered to have a low risk profile including cash and securities segregated and on deposit for regulatory and other purposes  securities received as collateral  securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed and identifiable intangible assets and goodwill 
this definition of net assets is used by many of our creditors and a leading rating agency to evaluate companies in the securities industry 
under this definition  net assets were billion and billion at november  and november   respectively  as follows net assets in millions november total assets   cash and securities segregated and on deposit for regulatory and other purposes   securities received as collateral   securities purchased under agreements to resell   securities borrowed   identifiable intangible assets and goodwill   net assets   in  a leading rating agency changed its definition of net leverage to exclude cash and securities segregated and on deposit for regulatory and other purposes from the calculation of net assets 
accordingly  net assets at november   has been restated to conform with this new definition 
our net assets consist primarily of inventory necessary to facilitate customer flow activities and  to a lesser degree  proprietary activities 
as such  our mix of net assets is subject to change depending primarily on customer demand 
in addition  due to the nature of our customer flow activities and based on our business outlook  the overall size of our balance sheet will fluctuate from time to time and  at specific points in time  may be higher than the year end or quarter end amounts 
our gross assets at quarter end were  on average  approximately lower than amounts based on a monthly average over both the four and eight quarters ended november  our net assets at quarter end were  on average  approximately lower than amounts based on a monthly average over both the four and eight quarters ended november  leverage ratios 
balance sheet leverage ratios are one measure used to evaluate the capital adequacy of a company 
the gross leverage ratio is calculated as total assets divided by total stockholders equity 
our gross leverage ratios were x and x at november  and  respectively 
however  we believe net leverage based on net assets as defined above which excludes certain assets considered to have a low risk profile and identifiable intangible assets and goodwill divided by tangible equity capital total stockholders equity plus junior subordinated debentures less identifiable intangible assets and goodwill  to be a more meaningful measure of leverage in evaluating companies in the securities industry 
our net leverage ratio of x declined from x at november  because we increased our tangible equity capital proportionately more than we increased our net assets 
we believe tangible equity capital to be a more representative measure of our equity for purposes of calculating net leverage because we do not view the amount of equity used to support identifiable intangible assets and goodwill as available to support our remaining net assets 
this definition of net leverage is used by many of our creditors and a leading rating agency 
tangible equity capital and net leverage are computed as follows at november  and tangible equity capital and net leverage in millions november total stockholders equity   junior subordinated debentures subject to limitation  preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption subject to limitation  identifiable intangible assets and goodwill   tangible equity capital   net leverage x x under the definition of tangible equity capital used by a leading rating agency  the maximum equity credit given to junior subordinated debentures and preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption is of tangible equity capital junior subordinated debentures and preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption are included in the calculation to determine the limit 
in  a leading rating agency changed its definition of net leverage to exclude cash and securities segregated and on deposit for regulatory and other purposes from the calculation of net assets 
accordingly  net leverage at november   has been restated to conform with this new definition 
net assets  tangible equity capital and net leverage as presented above are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies in the securities industry because of different methods of calculation 
stock repurchase program the management of equity is a critical aspect of our capital management 
the determination of the appropriate amount of equity is affected by a number of factors  including the amount of risk equity the businesses require  rating agency considerations  balance sheet leverage and the dilutive effect of our equity based employee incentive programs 
equity requirements constantly are changing  and we actively monitor our risk requirements 
the principal purposes of our stock repurchase program are to manage our equity capital relative to the growth of our business and our risk requirements  and to offset the dilutive effect of equity based employee incentive programs 
the repurchase program is effected through regular open market purchases as well as through the acquisition of mature shares from employees upon stock option exercises and the withholding of shares for required tax withholding upon option exercises and conversion of restricted stock units to freely tradeable common stock 
during  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately billion  or per share  as authorized by our board of directors 
in and  we repurchased stock primarily to offset the dilutive earnings per share effect of equity based employee incentive programs 
when evaluating the net funding requirements of stock repurchases  we consider the cash outflows net of the proceeds received from employees upon the exercise of stock options  the incremental tax benefits from the issuance of stock based awards and the value of employee services received as represented by the amortization of deferred stock compensation that will be settled by delivering shares of common stock instead of by paying cash 
for  our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to approximately million shares of holdings common stock 
of this amount  up to approximately million shares were authorized for repurchase to offset dilution due to employee stock plans in  and up to an additional million shares were authorized for repurchase in fiscal  subject to market conditions 
credit ratings like other companies in the securities industry  we rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of our day to day operations 
the cost and availability of unsecured financing generally are dependent on our short term and long term credit ratings 
factors that may be significant to the determination of our credit ratings or otherwise affect our ability to raise short term and long term financing include our profit margin  our earnings trend and volatility  our cash liquidity and liquidity management  our capital structure  our risk level and risk management  our geographic and business diversification  and our relative positions in the markets in which we operate 
a deterioration in any of the previously mentioned factors or combination of these factors may lead rating agencies to downgrade our credit ratings  thereby increasing the cost of  or possibly limiting our access to  certain types of unsecured financings and triggering additional collateral requirements in derivative contracts and other secured funding arrangements 
in addition  our debt ratings can affect certain capital markets revenues  particularly in those businesses where longer term counterparty performance is critical  such as otc derivative transactions  including credit derivatives and interest rate swaps 
at november   we would have been required to post additional collateral pursuant to derivative contracts and other secured funding arrangements of approximately million in the event we were to experience a downgrade of our senior debt rating of one notch and million in the event we were to experience a downgrade of our senior debt rating of two notches 
at november   the short and long term debt ratings of holdings and lehman brothers inc lbi were as follows credit ratings holdings lbi short term long term short term long term fitch ratings f a f a a moody s investors service p a p aa a standard poor s ratings services a a a a a senior subordinated 
provisional ratings on shelf registration 
in september  standard poor s ratings services revised its outlook on holdings and its subsidiaries to positive from stable 
the a a counterparty credit ratings were affirmed 
the outlook change indicates that over the medium term  if current trends continue  holdings issuer credit ratings could be raised 
the positive outlook is based on the improvements over the long term in business line diversification  market position  and earnings 
standard and poor s also recognized holdings strong risk management culture and very strong liquidity 
summary of contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business  we enter into various commitments and guarantees  including lending commitments to high grade and high yield borrowers  private equity investment commitments  liquidity commitments and other guarantees 
in all instances  we mark to market these commitments and guarantees  with changes in fair value recognized in principal transactions in the consolidated statement of income 
lending related commitments through our high grade and high yield sales  trading and underwriting activities  we make commitments to extend credit in loan syndication transactions 
we use various hedging and funding strategies to actively manage our market  credit and liquidity exposures on these commitments 
we do not believe total commitments necessarily are indicative of actual risk or funding requirements because the commitments may not be drawn or fully used and such amounts are reported before consideration of hedges 
these commitments and any related drawdowns of these facilities typically have fixed maturity dates and are contingent on certain representations  warranties and contractual conditions applicable to the borrower 
we define high yield non investment grade exposures as securities of or loans to companies rated bb or lower or equivalent ratings by recognized credit rating agencies  as well as non rated securities or loans that  in management s opinion  are non investment grade 
in addition  our mortgage origination platforms in our capital markets mortgage business make commitments to extend mortgage loans 
from time to time  we provide contingent commitments to investment and non investment grade counterparties related to acquisition financing 
our expectation is  and our past practice has been  to distribute through loan syndications to investors substantially all the credit risk associated with these loans  if closed  consistent with our credit facilitation framework 
we do not believe these commitments are necessarily indicative of our actual risk because the borrower may not complete a contemplated acquisition or  if the borrower completes the acquisition  often will raise funds in the capital markets instead of drawing on our commitment 
amount of commitment expiration per period in millions november  total contractual amount and later high grade     high yield    mortgage commitments   investment grade contingent acquisition facilities   non investment grade contingent acquisition facilities   secured lending transactions  including forward starting resale and repurchase agreements    we view our net credit exposure for high grade commitments  after consideration of hedges  to be billion 
we view our net credit exposure for high yield commitments  after consideration of hedges  to be billion 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our lending related commitments 
other commitments and guarantees other commitments and guarantees at november  were as follows amount of commitment expiration per period in millions november  notional maximum payout and later derivative contracts     municipal securities related commitments   other commitments with special purpose entities   standby letters of credit   private equity and other principal investment commitments fair value of these derivative contracts is a more relevant measure of these obligations because we believe the notional amount overstates the expected payout 
at november   the fair value of these derivative contracts approximated billion 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our other commitments and guarantees 
contractual obligations contractual obligations at november  were as follows amount of obligation expiration per period in millions november  total and thereafter long term debt maturities     operating lease obligations   capital lease obligations   purchase obligations see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about long term debt maturities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about operating and capital lease obligations 
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations with variable pricing provisions are included in the table based on the minimum contractual amounts 
certain purchase obligations contain termination or renewal provisions 
the table reflects the minimum contractual amounts likely to be paid under these agreements assuming the contracts are not terminated 
excluded from the table are a number of obligations recorded in the consolidated statement of financial condition that generally are short term in nature  including securities financing transactions  trading liabilities  deposits  commercial paper and other short term borrowings and other payables and accrued liabilities 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business we engage in a variety of off balance sheet arrangements  including derivative contracts 
derivatives derivatives often are referred to as off balance sheet instruments because neither their notional amounts nor the underlying instruments are reflected as assets or liabilities in our consolidated statement of financial condition 
instead  the market or fair values related to the derivative transactions are reported in the consolidated statement of financial condition as assets or liabilities in derivatives and other contractual agreements  as applicable 
in the normal course of business we enter into derivative transactions both in a trading capacity and as an end user 
we use derivative products in a trading capacity as a dealer to satisfy the financial needs of clients and to manage our own exposure to market and credit risks resulting from our trading activities collectively  trading related derivative activities 
in this capacity we transact extensively in derivatives including interest rate  credit both single name and portfolio  foreign exchange and equity derivatives 
the use of derivative products in our trading businesses is combined with transactions in cash instruments to allow for the execution of various trading strategies 
derivatives are recorded at market or fair value in the consolidated statement of financial condition on a net by counterparty basis when a legal right of set off exists and are netted across products when such provisions are stated in the master netting agreement 
as an end user  we use derivative products to adjust the interest rate nature of our funding sources from fixed to floating interest rates and to change the index on which floating interest rates are based eg  prime to libor 
we conduct our derivative activities through a number of wholly owned subsidiaries 
our fixed income derivative products business is conducted through our subsidiary lehman brothers special financing inc  and separately capitalized aaa rated subsidiaries  lehman brothers financial products inc and lehman brothers derivative products inc 
our equity derivative products business is conducted through lehman brothers finance sa and lehman brothers otc derivatives inc in addition  as a global investment bank  we also are a market maker in a number of foreign currencies 
counterparties to our derivative product transactions primarily are us and foreign banks  securities firms  corporations  governments and their agencies  finance companies  insurance companies  investment companies and pension funds 
we manage the risks associated with derivatives on an aggregate basis  along with the risks associated with our non derivative trading and market making activities in cash instruments  as part of our firmwide risk management policies 
we use industry standard derivative contracts whenever appropriate 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our accounting policies and our trading related derivative activities 
special purpose entities in the normal course of business  we establish special purpose entities spes  sell assets to spes  transact derivatives with spes  own securities or residual interests in spes  and provide liquidity or other guarantees for spes 
spes are corporations  trusts or partnerships that are established for a limited purpose 
there are two types of spes qualifying special purpose entities qspes and variable interest entities vies 
spes  by their nature  generally are not controlled by their equity owners  because the establishing documents govern all material decisions 
our primary involvement with spes relates to securitization transactions through qspes  in which transferred assets are sold to an spe that issues securities supported by the cash flows generated by the assets ie  securitized 
a qspe can generally be described as an entity with significantly limited powers that are intended to limit it to passively holding financial assets and distributing cash flows to investors on pre set terms 
under sfas  we are not required to  and do not  consolidate qspes 
rather  we account for our involvement with qspes under a financial components approach in which we recognize any interest we retain after securitization at fair value  with changes in fair value reported in principal transactions in the consolidated statement of income 
we are a market leader in mortgage both residential and commercial  municipal and other asset backed securitizations that are principally transacted through qspes 
during and  we securitized approximately billion and billion of financial assets  respectively  including billion and billion of residential loans  billion and billion of commercial mortgages  and billion and billion of municipal and other asset backed financial instruments  respectively 
at november  and we had approximately billion and billion  respectively  of non investment grade retained interests from our securitization activities primarily junior security interests in securitizations 
in addition  we deal extensively with spes  which do not meet the qspe criteria due to their permitted activities not being sufficiently limited  or because the assets are not deemed qualifying financial instruments eg  real estate 
under fin r  we consolidate such spes if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of such entity 
the primary beneficiary is the party that has either a majority of the expected losses or a majority of the expected residual returns of such entity  as defined 
examples of our involvement with spes include collateralized debt obligations  synthetic credit transactions  real estate investments through spes  and other structured financing transactions 
for additional information about our involvement with spes see note to the consolidated financial statements 
other off balance sheet activities in the ordinary course of business we enter into various other types of off balance sheet arrangements

risk management as a leading global investment bank  risk is an inherent part of our business 
global markets  by their nature  are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks 
the principal risks we face are credit  market  liquidity  legal  reputation and operational risks 
risk management is considered to be of paramount importance in our day to day operations 
consequently  we devote significant resources including investments in personnel and technology to the measurement  analysis and management of risk 
while risk cannot be eliminated it can be mitigated to the greatest extent possible through a strong internal control environment 
essential in our approach to risk management is a strong internal control environment with multiple overlapping and reinforcing elements 
we have developed policies and procedures to identify  measure  and monitor the risks involved in our global trading  brokerage and investment banking activities 
our approach applies analytical rigor overlaid with sound practical judgment working proactively with the business areas before transactions occur to ensure appropriate risk mitigants are in place 
we also seek to reduce risk through the diversification of our businesses  counterparties and activities in geographic regions 
we accomplish this objective by allocating the usage of capital to each of our businesses  establishing trading limits and setting credit limits for individual counterparties 
our focus is balancing risk versus return 
we seek to achieve adequate returns from each of our businesses commensurate with the risks they assume 
nonetheless  the effectiveness of our approach to managing risks can never be completely assured 
for example  unexpected large or rapid movements or disruptions in one or more markets or other unforeseen developments could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the consequences of these developments can include losses due to adverse changes in inventory values  decreases in the liquidity of trading positions  increases in our credit exposure to customers and counterparties and increases in general systemic risk 
our overall risk limits and risk management policies are established by the executive committee 
on a weekly basis  our risk committee  which consists of the executive committee  the chief risk officer and the chief financial officer  reviews all risk exposures  position concentrations and risk taking activities 
the global risk management division the division is independent of the trading areas and reports directly to the firm s chief administrative officer 
the division includes credit risk management  market risk management  quantitative risk management and operational risk management 
combining these disciplines facilitates a fully integrated approach to risk management 
the division maintains staff in each of our regional trading centers as well as in key sales offices 
risk management personnel have multiple levels of daily contact with trading staff and senior management at all levels within the company 
these discussions include reviews of trading positions and risk exposures 
credit risk credit risk represents the possibility a counterparty or an issuer of securities or other financial instruments we hold will be unable to honor its contractual obligations to us 
credit risk management is therefore an integral component of our overall risk management framework 
the credit risk management department crm department has global responsibility for implementing our overall credit risk management framework 
the crm department manages the credit exposure related to trading activities by giving credit approval for counterparties  assigning internal risk ratings  establishing credit limits by counterparty  country and industry group  and by requiring master netting agreements and collateral in appropriate circumstances 
the crm department considers the transaction size  the duration of a transaction  along with the potential credit exposure for complex derivative transactions in making our credit decisions 
the crm department is responsible for the continuous monitoring and review of counterparty risk ratings  current credit exposures and potential credit exposures across all products and recommending valuation adjustments  where appropriate 
credit limits are reviewed periodically to ensure they remain appropriate in light of market events or the counterparty s financial condition 
credit also has responsibility for portfolio management of counterparty credit risks 
this includes monitoring and reporting large exposures current credit exposure and maximum potential exposure  managing concentrations across countries  industries and products  ensuring risk ratings are current and performing asset quality portfolio trend analyses 
our chief risk officer is a member of the investment banking commitment  investment and bridge loan approval committees 
members of credit and market risk management participate in committee meetings  vetting and reviewing transactions 
decisions on approving transactions not only take into account the creditworthiness of the transaction on a stand alone basis  but also they take into consideration our aggregate obligor risk  portfolio concentrations  reputation risk and importantly the impact that any particular transaction under consideration has on our overall risk appetite 
exceptional transactions and or situations are addressed and discussed with senior management  including where appropriate  the executive committee 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates derivatives and other contractual agreements in this md a and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about net credit exposure on otc derivative contracts 
market risk market risk represents the potential change in value of a portfolio of financial instruments due to changes in market rates  prices and volatilities 
market risk management also is an essential component of our overall risk management framework 
the market risk management department the mrm department has global responsibility for developing and implementing our overall market risk management framework 
to that end  it is responsible for the development of the policies and procedures of the market risk management process  determination of market risk measurement methodology in conjunction with the quantitative risk management department the qrm department  monitoring  reporting and analysis of the aggregate market risk of trading exposures  administration of market risk limits and the escalation process  and the communication of large or unusual risks as appropriate 
market risks inherent in positions includes  but is not limited to  interest rate  equity and foreign exchange exposures 
the mrm department uses qualitative as well as quantitative information in managing trading risk  believing a combination of the two approaches results in a more robust and complete approach to the management of trading risk 
quantitative information is developed from a variety of risk methodologies based on established statistical principles 
to ensure high standards of analysis  the mrm department has retained seasoned risk managers with the requisite experience and academic and professional credentials 
market risk is present in cash products  derivatives and contingent claim structures that exhibit linear as well as non linear price behavior 
our exposure to market risk varies in accordance with the volume of client driven market making transactions  the size of our proprietary positions  and the volatility of financial instruments traded 
we seek to mitigate  whenever possible  excess market risk exposures through appropriate hedging strategies 
we participate globally in interest rate  equity and foreign exchange markets 
our fixed income division has a broadly diversified market presence in us and foreign government bond trading  emerging market securities  corporate debt investment and non investment grade  money market instruments  mortgages and mortgage and asset backed securities  real estate  municipal bonds and interest rate derivatives 
our equities division facilitates domestic and foreign trading in equity instruments  indices and related derivatives 
our foreign exchange businesses are involved in trading currencies on a spot and forward basis as well as through derivative products and contracts 
we incur short term interest rate risk in the course of facilitating the orderly flow of customer transactions through the maintenance of government and other bond inventories 
market making in high grade corporate bonds and high yield instruments exposes us to additional risk due to potential variations in credit spreads 
trading in international markets exposes us to spread risk between the term structure of interest rates in different countries 
mortgages and mortgage related securities are subject to prepayment risk and changes in the level of interest rates 
trading in derivatives and structured products exposes us to changes in the level and volatility of interest rates 
we actively manage interest rate risk through the use of interest rate futures  options  swaps  forwards and offsetting cash market instruments 
inventory holdings  concentrations and agings are monitored closely and used by management to selectively hedge or liquidate undesirable exposures 
we are a significant intermediary in the global equity markets through our market making in us and us equity securities  including common stock  convertible debt  exchange traded and otc equity options  equity swaps and warrants 
these activities expose us to market risk as a result of price and volatility changes in our equity inventory 
inventory holdings also are subject to market risk resulting from concentrations and changes in liquidity conditions that may adversely affect market valuation 
equity market risk is actively managed through the use of index futures  exchange traded and otc options  swaps and cash instruments 
we enter into foreign exchange transactions to facilitate the purchase and sale of non dollar instruments  including equity and interest rate securities 
we are exposed to foreign exchange risk on our holdings of non dollar assets and liabilities 
we are active in many foreign exchange markets and have exposure to the euro  japanese yen  british pound  swiss franc and canadian dollar  as well as a variety of developed and emerging market currencies 
we hedge our risk exposures primarily through the use of currency forwards  swaps  futures and options 
if any of the strategies used to hedge or otherwise mitigate exposures to the various types of risks described above are not effective  we could incur losses 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our use of derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate  currency  equity and other market risks 
operational risk operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems  or from external events 
operational risk management the orm department is responsible for implementing and maintaining our overall global operational risk management framework  which seeks to minimize these risks through assessing  reporting  monitoring and mitigating operational risks 
reputational risk we recognize that maintaining our reputation among clients  investors  regulators and the general public is an important aspect of minimizing legal and operational risks 
maintaining our reputation depends on a large number of factors  including the selection of our clients and the conduct of our business activities 
we seek to maintain our reputation by screening potential clients and by conducting our business activities in accordance with high ethical standards 
potential clients are screened through a multi step process that begins with the individual business units and product groups 
in screening clients  these groups undertake a comprehensive review of the client and its background and the potential transaction to determine  among other things  whether they pose any risks to our reputation 
potential transactions are screened by independent committees in the firm  which are composed of senior members from various corporate divisions of the company including members of the global risk management division 
these committees review the nature of the client and its business  the due diligence conducted by the business units and product groups  and the proposed terms of the transaction  in order to determine overall acceptability of the proposed transaction 
in doing so  the committees evaluate the appropriateness of the transaction  including a consideration of ethical and social responsibility issues and the potential effect of the transaction on our reputation 
value at risk value at risk var measures the potential mark to market loss over a specified time horizon and is expressed at a given confidence level 
we report an empirical var calculated based upon the distribution of actual trading revenue 
we consider var based on net revenue volatility to be a comprehensive risk measurement tool as it incorporates virtually all of our trading activities and types of risk including market  credit and event risks 
the table below presents var in and for each component of risk using historical daily net trading revenues 
under this method  we estimate a reporting daily var using actual daily net trading revenues over the previous trading days 
such var is measured as the loss  relative to the median daily trading net revenue  at a confidence level 
value at risk revenue volatility year ended november at november in millions average high low average high low interest rate risk equity price risk foreign exchange risk diversification benefit the increase in interest rate risk at november  from november  reflects the increased scale of our fixed income businesses 
the increase in equity risk is primarily related to higher levels of equity positions held 
beginning with this annual report  we are disclosing an estimated var  which uses a historical simulation approach 
this var measures market risk associated with substantially all of our financial instruments 
our estimated var measures both linear and non linear risk at a very granular level to ensure we capture second order risks in addition to first order risk 
we believe both measures of var being disclosed provide relevant information to financial statement users 
historical simulation var utilizes end of day positions to determine the expected revenue loss at a confidence level over a one day time horizon 
specifically  the historical simulation approach involves constructing a distribution of hypothetical daily changes in the value of the trading portfolio based on risk factors embedded in the current portfolio and historical observations of daily changes in these risk factors 
our method uses four years of historical data weighted to give greater impact to more recent time periods in simulating potential changes in market risk factors 
as there is no uniform industry methodology for estimating var  different assumptions and methodologies could produce materially different results and therefore caution should be utilized when comparing such risk measures across firms 
we believe our models and assumptions utilized in these calculations to be reasonable and prudent 
we utilize a one day var which corresponds to the loss in portfolio value that  based on historically observed market risk factor movements  would have been exceeded with a frequency of  or once in every days if the portfolio were held constant 
we perform periodic back testing comparing actual daily trading revenues against historical simulation var to ensure reasonableness of the var model 
the following table sets forth historical simulation var at and for the annual period ended november  value at risk historical simulation year ended november  in millions at november  average high low interest rate risk equity price risk foreign exchange risk diversification benefit as with any predictive model  var measures have inherent limitations including past changes in market risk factors may not be accurate predictors of future market movements  the historical market risk factor data used for var estimation may provide only limited insight into losses that could be incurred under market conditions that are unusual relative to the historical period used in estimating the var  and var measurements are based on current positions while future risk depends on future positions 
in addition  a one day historical simulation var does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged within one day 
we are aware of these limitations and therefore use var as only one measure of our assessment of risk 
we also utilize other risk analytics to complement var  including stress tests and modeling of event and counterparty risks on a portfolio basis 
distribution of daily net revenues substantially all of the company s inventory positions are marked to market daily with changes recorded in net revenues 
the following chart sets forth the frequency distribution for daily net revenues for our capital markets and investment management business segments excluding asset management fees for the years ended november  and as discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we seek to reduce risk through the diversification of our businesses and a focus on customer flow activities 
this diversification and focus  combined with our risk management controls and processes  helps mitigate the net revenue volatility inherent in our trading activities 
although historical performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance  we believe our focus on business diversification and customer flow activities should continue to reduce the volatility of future net trading revenues 
average daily trading net revenues graphic in both and  daily trading net revenues did not exceed losses of million on any single day 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions 
we believe the estimates used in preparing our financial statements are reasonable and prudent 
actual results could differ from these estimates particularly in light of the industry in which we operate 
the following is a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of these and other accounting policies 
fair value the determination of fair value is a critical accounting policy that is fundamental to our financial condition and results of operations 
we record financial instruments classified as securities and other inventory positions owned and securities and other inventory positions sold but not yet purchased at market or fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reflected in principal transactions in the consolidated statement of income 
in all instances  we believe we have established rigorous internal control processes to ensure we use reasonable and prudent measurements of fair value on a consistent basis 
when evaluating the extent to which estimates may be required in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities reflected in our financial statements  we believe it is useful to analyze the balance sheet as shown in the following table summary balance sheet in millions november  assets securities and other inventory positions owned  securities received as collateral  secured financings  receivables and other assets  identifiable intangible assets and goodwill  total assets  liabilities and equity securities and other inventory positions sold but not yet purchased obligation to return securities received as collateral  secured financings  payables and other accrued liabilities  total capital  total liabilities and equity  the majority of our assets and liabilities are recorded at amounts for which significant management estimates are not used 
the following balance sheet categories  comprising of total assets and of total liabilities and equity  are valued either at historical cost or at contract value including accrued interest which  by their nature  do not require the use of significant estimates secured financings  receivables and other assets  payables and other accrued liabilities and total capital 
securities received as collateral and obligation to return securities received as collateral are recorded at fair value  but due to their offsetting nature do not result in fair value estimates affecting the consolidated statement of income 
securities and other inventory positions owned and securities and other inventory positions sold but not yet purchased long and short inventory positions  respectively  are recorded at market or fair value  the components of which may require  to varying degrees  the use of estimates in determining fair value 
when evaluating the extent to which management estimates may be used in determining the fair value for long and short inventory  we believe it is useful to consider separately derivatives and cash instruments 
derivatives and other contractual agreements 
the fair values of derivative assets and liabilities at november  were billion and billion  respectively see note to the consolidated financial statements 
included within these amounts were exchange traded derivative assets and liabilities of billion and billion  respectively  for which fair value is determined based on quoted market prices 
the fair values of our otc derivative assets and liabilities at november  were billion and billion  respectively 
the following table sets the fair value of otc derivatives by contract type and by remaining contractual maturity fair value of otc derivative contracts by maturity in millions november  less than year to years to years over years cross maturity and cash collateral netting total assets interest rate  currency and credit default swaps and options  foreign exchange forward contracts and options  other fixed income securities contracts  equity contracts   liabilities interest rate  currency and credit default swaps and options  foreign exchange forward contracts and options  other fixed income securities contracts equity contracts   cross maturity netting represents the netting of receivable balances with payable balances for the same counterparty across maturity and product categories 
receivable and payable balances with the same counterparty in the same maturity category are netted within the maturity category when appropriate 
cash collateral received or paid is netted on a counterparty basis  provided legal right of offset exists 
the majority of our otc derivatives are transacted in liquid trading markets for which fair value is determined using pricing models with readily observable market inputs 
examples of such derivatives include interest rate swap contracts  tbas  foreign exchange forward and option contracts in g currencies and equity swap and option contracts on listed securities 
however  the determination of fair value of certain less liquid derivatives required the use of significant estimates 
such derivatives include certain credit derivatives  equity option contracts with terms greater than five years  and certain other complex derivatives we provide to clients 
we strive to limit the use of significant estimates by using consistent pricing assumptions between reporting periods and using observed market data for model inputs whenever possible 
as the market for complex products develops  we refine our pricing models based on market experience to use the most current indicators of fair value 
cash instruments 
the majority of our non derivative long and short inventory ie  cash instruments is recorded at market value based on listed market prices or using third party broker quotes and therefore does not incorporate significant estimates 
examples of inventory valued in this manner include government securities  agency mortgage backed securities  listed equities  money market instruments  municipal securities and corporate bonds 
however  in certain instances we may deem such quotations to be unrealizable eg  when the instruments are thinly traded or when we hold a substantial block of a particular security such that the listed price is not deemed to be readily realizable 
in such instances  we determine fair value based on  among other factors  management s best estimate giving appropriate consideration to reported prices and the extent of public trading in similar securities  the discount from the listed price associated with the cost at date of acquisition and the size of the position held in relation to the liquidity in the market 
when the size of our holding of a listed security is likely to impair our ability to realize the quoted market price  we record the position at a discount to the quoted price reflecting our best estimate of fair value 
when quoted prices are not available  fair value is determined based on pricing models or other valuation techniques  including the use of implied pricing from similar instruments 
pricing models typically are used to derive fair value based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows including adjustments  when appropriate  for liquidity  credit and or other factors 
for the vast majority of instruments valued through pricing models  significant estimates are not required because the market inputs to such models are readily observable and liquid trading markets provide clear evidence to support the valuations derived from such pricing models 
examples of inventory valued using pricing models or other valuation techniques for which the use of management estimates are necessary include certain mortgages and mortgage backed positions  real estate inventory  non investment grade retained interests  certain derivative and other contractual agreements  certain high yield positions and certain private equity and other principal investments 
mortgages  mortgage backed and real estate inventory positions 
mortgages and mortgage backed positions include mortgage loans both residential and commercial and non agency mortgage backed securities 
we are a market leader in mortgage backed securities trading 
we originate residential and commercial mortgage loans as an extension of our securitization activities 
in we originated approximately billion of residential mortgage loans and we securitized approximately billion of residential mortgage loans  including both originated loans and those we acquired in the secondary market 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our securitization activities 
we record mortgage loans at fair value  with related mark to market gains and losses recognized in principal transactions in the consolidated statement of income 
management estimates are generally not required in determining the fair value of residential mortgage loans because these positions are securitized frequently 
certain commercial mortgage loans and investments  due to their less liquid nature  may require management estimates in determining fair value 
fair value for these positions is generally based on analyses of both cash flow projections and underlying property values 
we use independent appraisals to support our assessment of the property in determining fair value for these positions 
fair value for approximately billion and billion at november  and  respectively  of our total mortgage loan inventory is determined using the above valuation methodologies  which may involve the use of significant estimates 
because a portion of these assets have been financed on a non recourse basis  our net investment position is limited to billion and billion at november  and  respectively 
we invest in real estate through direct investments in equity and debt 
we record real estate held for sale at the lower of cost or fair value 
the assessment of fair value generally requires the use of management estimates and generally is based on property appraisals provided by third parties and also incorporates an analysis of the related property cash flow projections 
we had real estate investments of approximately billion and billion at november  and  respectively 
because a significant portion of these assets has been financed on a non recourse basis  our net investment position was limited to billion and billion at november  and  respectively 
high yield 
we underwrite  invest and make markets in high yield corporate debt securities 
we also syndicate  trade and invest in loans to below investment grade rated companies 
for purposes of this discussion  high yield debt instruments are defined as securities of or loans to companies rated bb or lower or equivalent ratings by recognized credit rating agencies  as well as non rated securities or loans that  in management s opinion  are non investment grade 
non investment grade securities generally involve greater risks than investment grade securities due to the issuer s creditworthiness and the lower liquidity of the market for such securities 
in addition  these issuers generally have relatively higher levels of indebtedness resulting in an increased sensitivity to adverse economic conditions 
we recognize these risks and seek to reduce market and credit risk through the diversification of our products and counterparties 
high yield debt instruments are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reflected in principal transactions in the consolidated statement of income 
such instruments at november  and included long positions with an aggregate fair value of approximately billion and billion and short positions with an aggregate fair value of approximately billion and billion  respectively 
at november   the largest industry and geographic concentrations were and  respectively  categorized within the broad manufacturing industrial classification and in the united states  respectively 
the majority of these positions are valued using broker quotes or listed market prices 
however  at november   approximately million of these positions were valued using other valuation techniques because there was little or no trading activity 
in such instances  we use prudent judgment in determining fair value  which may involve using analyses of credit spreads associated with pricing of similar instruments  or other valuation techniques 
we mitigate our aggregate and single issuer net exposure through the use of derivatives  non recourse financing and other financial instruments 
private equity and other principal investments 
our private equity business operates in five major asset classes merchant banking  real estate  venture capital  fixed income related investments and private funds investments 
we have raised privately placed funds in all of these classes  for which we act as general partner and in which we have general and in some cases limited partner interests 
in addition  we generally co invest in the investments made by the funds or may make other non fund related direct investments 
we carry our private equity investments  including our general and limited partnership interests  at fair value 
at november  and  our private equity related investments totaled billion and billion  respectively 
at november   the largest industry concentration was and the largest single investment exposure was million 
in addition to our private equity investments we held approximately million in energy related principal investments at november   compared with million at november  the determination of fair value for these investments often requires the use of estimates and assumptions because these investments generally are less liquid and often contain trading restrictions 
we estimate that approximately million of these investments have readily determinable fair values because they are publicly traded securities with limited remaining trading restrictions 
for the remainder of these positions  fair value is based on our assessment of the underlying investments incorporating valuations that consider expected cash flows  earnings multiples and or comparisons to similar market transactions 
valuation adjustments  which may involve the use of significant management estimates  are an integral part of pricing these instruments  reflecting consideration of credit quality  concentration risk  sale restrictions and other liquidity factors 
additional information about our private equity and other principal investment activities  including related commitments  can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
non investment grade retained interests 
we held approximately billion and billion of non investment grade retained interests at november  and  respectively 
because these interests primarily represent the junior interests in commercial and residential mortgage securitizations for which there are not active trading markets  estimates generally are required in determining fair value 
we value these instruments using prudent estimates of expected cash flows and consider the valuation of similar transactions in the market 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the effect of adverse changes in assumptions on the fair value of these interests 
identifiable intangible assets and goodwill we acquired neuberger in october for a net purchase price initially estimated to be approximately billion  excluding net cash and short term investments acquired of approximately million 
the cost was allocated to the underlying net assets based on preliminary estimates of their fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired which included certain intangible assets initially carried at million in the consolidated statement of financial condition was recorded as goodwill 
during we finalized the purchase price valuation and allocation of our acquisition of neuberger based on an independent third party study 
as a result  we reduced our initial estimate of the purchase price by approximately million related to certain securities we issued that were restricted from resale for periods extending through the initial allocation of the purchase price to identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed did not change 
determining the fair values and useful lives of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed associated with business acquisitions intangible assets in particular requires significant judgment 
in addition  we are required to assess for impairment goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually using fair value measurement techniques 
periodically estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and intangible assets with indefinite lives involves significant judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant effect on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of such a charge 
we completed our last goodwill impairment test as of august   and no impairment was identified 
real estate reconfiguration charges as a result of our decision to exit our downtown new york area facilities after the events of september  and our decision in to reconfigure certain of our global real estate facilities  we recognized real estate reconfiguration charges in  and the recognition of these charges required significant management estimates including estimates of the vacancy periods prior to subleasing  the anticipated rates of subleases  and the amounts of incentives eg  free rent periods that may be required to induce sub lessees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the real estate reconfiguration charges 
legal reserves in the normal course of business we have been named a defendant in a number of lawsuits and other legal and regulatory proceedings 
such proceedings include actions brought against us and others with respect to transactions in which we acted as an underwriter or financial advisor  actions arising out of our activities as a broker or dealer in securities and commodities and actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants against many securities firms  including us 
in addition  our business activities are reviewed by various taxing authorities around the world with regard to corporate income tax rules and regulations 
we estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of legal  regulatory and tax proceedings to the extent such losses are probable and can be estimated

accounting and regulatory developments in january  the fasb issued fin in december  the fasb revised fin fin r 
we have adopted fin r for all variable interest entities in which we hold a variable interest 
the effect of adopting fin r in fiscal was not material to our financial condition or results of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the effect of adopting fin r on certain delaware business trusts formed for the purpose of issuing trust securities

fas in our fourth quarter 
adoption did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in december the fasb issued sfas r 
we must adopt sfas r by our fourth quarter 
sfas r requires public companies to recognize expense in the income statement for the grant date fair value of awards of equity instruments to employees 
expense is to be recognized over the period during which employees are required to provide service 
sfas r also clarifies and expands the guidance in sfas in several areas  including measuring fair value and attributing compensation cost to reporting periods 
for periods before the required effective date  companies may elect to apply a modified version of retrospective application under which financial statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by sfas under the modified prospective transition method we expect to apply  compensation cost is recognized after the date of adoption for the portion of outstanding awards granted prior to the adoption of sfas for which service has not yet been rendered 
we do not expect adoption of sfas r will have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition  and expect to adopt sfas r in our fourth quarter 
in december the fasb issued an fsp regarding the accounting implications of the american jobs creation act of the act related to the one time tax benefit for the repatriation of foreign earnings 
the fsp is effective for financial statements for periods ended after october  the act creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the us by providing an percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
the deduction is subject to a number of limitations and uncertainty remains about how to interpret numerous provisions in the act 
we are reviewing the act to determine the implications of repatriating  out of our accumulated non us retained earnings pool  a portion of such earnings that we currently do not consider to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries 
we expect the tax benefits associated with any amount repatriated would not be material to our results of operations or financial condition 
in june the securities and exchange commission the sec approved a rule establishing a voluntary framework for comprehensive  group wide risk management procedures and consolidated supervision of certain financial services holding companies 
the framework is designed to minimize the duplicative regulatory burdens on us securities firms resulting from the european union the eu directive ec concerning the supplementary supervision of financial conglomerates active in the eu 
the rule also would allow lbi to use an alternative method  based on internal models  to calculate net capital charges for market and derivative related credit risk 
under this rule  the sec has the authority to regulate the holding company and any unregulated affiliate of a registered broker dealer  including subjecting the holding company to capital requirements generally consistent with the international convergence of capital measurement and capital standards published by the basel committee on banking supervision 
we expect to apply to the sec in early for permission to operate under the rule 
we cannot predict the effect these changes will have on our businesses  however  compliance with consolidated supervision and the imposition of revised capital standards could affect our decisions with respect to raising and using capital 
effects of inflation because our assets are  to a large extent  liquid in nature  they are not significantly affected by inflation 
however  the rate of inflation affects such expenses as employee compensation  office space leasing costs and communications charges  which may not be readily recoverable in the prices of services we offer 
to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects on the securities markets  it may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in certain businesses
