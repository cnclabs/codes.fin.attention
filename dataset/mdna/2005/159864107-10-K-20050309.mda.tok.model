item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading provider of critical research tools and integrated support services that enable innovative and efficient drug discovery and development 
we are the global leader in providing the animal research models required in research and development for new drugs  devices and therapies and have been in business for more than years 
our acquisition of inveresk during the fourth quarter of provides us with the platform to expand our preclinical business  service customers in the clinical market and develop additional closely related business with potential for future growth 
our expanded products and services capability resulting from the inveresk acquisition allows us to provide customers with broader support for their efforts to bring new drugs  devices and therapies to market 
we have created a global leader in research models and services  a leader in drug safety testing  a significant provider of phase i iv clinical development services and of biosafety testing 
the continued growth for drug discovery and development services  which was aided by customers increased outsourcing programs  along with our ongoing customer focus continued to strengthen our global business operations 
these factors resulted in strong financial performance in demonstrated by solid revenue growth  strong profitability and cash flow 
during the year we experienced favorable market conditions as demand remained strong especially for toxicology services 
customers continued to outsource services to aid them in their efforts to bring new drugs  devices and therapies to market 
we continue to see strong customer demand for toxicology services and specialty animals in our markets 
to support the growing demand overseas for our rms business  we opened two new facilities in in lyon  france and osaka  japan and a third new facility in the tokyo area which opened in february to meet the growing demand for our preclinical services  we have a number of expansion projects underway including new capacity in montreal  canada  which is scheduled to open in the first quarter of and in edinburgh  scotland  which is scheduled to open in early finally  our growth strategy has long included the acquisition of companies to serve as growth platforms 
we continue to see near and long term opportunities for adding new platforms through acquisition that complement our business and increase the rate of our growth 
our results for include the nine weeks in the year during which inveresk was owned by us 
total net sales in were million  an increase of over the same period last year 
inveresk contributed to the net sales gain and favorable foreign currency translation contributed approximately to the net sales gain 
our gross margin increased to of net sales  compared to of net sales for the same period last year 
operating income for the year was compared to for the operating margin was compared to for last year 
our operating margin was unfavorably impacted by due to amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of inveresk of million  stock based compensation related to the acquisition of inveresk of million and the proteomics write off of million 
net income was million in compared to million in diluted earnings per share for was compared to in the unfavorable impact of the inveresk amortization  inveresk related stock based compensation  proteomics write off and a deferred tax adjustment related to the european reorganization  partially offset by a favorable reversal of the tax valuation allowance  reduced diluted earnings per share by in we report three segments  research models and services rms  preclinical services and clinical services 
we changed our segments to reflect our results of operations and facilitate understanding of the company s business 
the changes in segments have no effect on our consolidated revenues or net income 
the rms segment aligns all the businesses that are based upon research models including sales of research models  transgenic services  laboratory services and contract staffing 
our preclinical services segment includes all the product and services to take a drug or medical device through the development process including sales of general and specialty toxicology services  pathology services  interventional and surgical services  biopharmaceutical services  pharmacokinetic and metabolic analysis and bioanalytical chemistry 
the clinical services segment was created with the acquisition of inveresk with its clinical service business 
our clinical services segment conducts phase i clinical trials and provides phase ii iv clinical trials management services which includes testing  medical data sciences services and regulatory support 
our rms segment represented of net sales in net sales for this segment increased over the same period in favorable foreign currency translation contributed approximately of the net sales gain 
operating income increased to of net sales in  compared to of net sales for the same period last year resulting from increased utilization due to the sales growth partially offset by the litigation settlement in which accounted for 
our preclinical services segment represented of net sales in sales for this segment increased over the same period last year 
favorable foreign currency translation contributed less than of the net sales gain during the year we experienced favorable market conditions as demand for toxicology services remained strong 
we see improving levels of customer demand in certain of our development services businesses  particularly large animal  reproductive toxicology and inhalation 
our clinical services segment represented of net sales in we acquired the clinical service business with the acquisition of inveresk during the fourth quarter 
the following tables show the net sales and the percentage contribution of each of our reportable segments for the past three years

the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and use assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and assumptions 
some of those estimates can be subjective and complex  consequently actual results could differ from those estimates 
management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
for any given estimate or assumption made by management  there may also be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable 
however  we believe that given the current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any such alternative judgments would materially impact the accompanying financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies are most effected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following summary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates include the following goodwill and other intangible assets revenue recognition pension plan accounting income taxes and deferred tax assets goodwill and other intangible assets 
with the acquisition of inveresk and other businesses we have acquired  we have material intangible assets  including goodwill and other identifiable finite and indefinite lived acquired intangibles 
the identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition  as well as the completion of annual impairment tests  require significant management judgments and estimates 
these estimates are made based on  among others  consultations with an accredited independent valuation consultant  reviews of projected future income cash flows and statutory regulations 
the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets  and potentially result in a different impact to our results of operations 
furthermore  changes in business strategy and or market conditions may significantly impact these judgments thereby impacting the fair value of these assets  which could result in an impairment of the goodwill 
we performed annual impairment tests in and concluded the goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset balances were not impaired 
as of december   we had recorded goodwill and other intangibles of billion in the consolidated balance sheet 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on product and services sales 
recognition of service revenue is primarily based on the completion of agreed upon service procedures including rate specified contracts and fixed fee contracts 
revenue of agreed upon rate contracts is recognized as services are performed  based on rates specified in the contract 
revenue of fixed fee contracts is recognized as services are performed in accordance with procedures specified by the customers in the form of study protocols 
the recognition of service revenue requires management judgments primarily relating to the determination of the level of service procedures performed during the period 
in some cases  a portion of the contract fee is paid at the time the study is initiated 
these advances are deferred and recognized as revenue as services are performed 
as of december   we had recorded unbilled revenue of million and deferred revenue of million in the consolidated balance sheet based on the difference between the estimated level of services performed and the billing arrangements within our service contracts 
pension plan accounting 
we have significant plan assets  liabilities and expenses based on information provided by independent actuaries 
as of december   we had recorded prepaid pension benefit of million and a long term liability of million 
the actuaries use assumptions to estimate the total benefits ultimately payable to employees and allocate this cost to the service periods 
the actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension costs are determined and reviewed annually by management after consulting with outside investment advisors and actuaries 
the assumed discount rate  which is intended to be the actual rate at which benefits could effectively be settled  is adjusted based on the change in the long term bond yield as of the measurement date 
as of december  the weighted average discount rate for our pension plans was 
the assumed expected return on plan assets is the average return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide future benefits to pension plan participants 
if the actual return is different from the assumed expected return in plan assets  the difference would be amortized over a period of approximately to years 
during  we lowered our expected return on plan assets resulting in a weighted average return of from for our pension plans 
this is expected to increase the annual pension expense by approximately million in income taxes and deferred tax assets 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure and assessing temporary and permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
as part of our recapitalization transaction  we elected under internal revenue code section h to treat the transaction as a purchase resulting in a step up in the tax basis of the underlying assets 
the election resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax asset in in the amount of million for the estimated future tax benefits associated with the increased tax basis of the assets 
the balance of this deferred tax asset as of december  was million 
in the first quarter of  we reorganized our european operations 
the purpose of the reorganization was to streamline the legal entity structure in order to improve operating efficiency and cash management  facilitate acquisitions and provide tax benefits 
the reorganization  which did not involve reductions of personnel or facility closures  resulted in a one time  non cash charge to earnings in the first quarter of of approximately million due primarily to the write off of a deferred tax asset 
in connection with the restructuring  we recorded a tax benefit of million on the reduction of a valuation allowance on its foreign tax credits 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
as of december   we had a valuation allowance of approximately million 
the valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards in jurisdictions where management does not believe it is more likely than not a benefit will be realized 
approximately million of the valuation was established against deferred tax assets acquired as part of the inveresk acquisition and any future recognition of the asset will result in an adjustment to goodwill 
we have recognized the balance of the deferred tax asset on the belief that it is more likely than not it will be realized 
this belief is based on all available evidence including historical operating results  projections of taxable income  and tax planning strategies 
we have provided million for us income taxes on inveresk s non us earnings as of october   the date of the inveresk acquisition 
the amount of the deferred tax liability is based on tax law as enacted on october  we intend to use the pre acquisition inveresk earnings to fund a portion of the debt incurred in the acquisition 
as of december   earnings of non us subsidiaries considered to be indefinitely reinvested totaled million 
no provision for us income taxes has been provided thereon 
upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to both us taxes and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on this undistributed foreign income 
on october   the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law 
the act creates a temporary incentive for us multinationals to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the us at an effective tax rate of 
this provision is applicable to our fiscal year we are currently in the process of evaluating whether or not  and to what extent  if any  this provision may benefit us 
if we decide to repatriate all of the pre acquisition earnings of inveresk in a distribution that qualifies for the reduced tax rate under the act  we estimate that we may recognize a one time tax benefit of million in the quarter in which the decision is made 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets 
the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease our deferred tax assets and materially impact our results of operations 
furthermore in the event that actual results differ from management s estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  our operating results and financial position could be materially affected 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales in were million  an increase of million  or  from million in research models and services 
in  net sales from our rms segment were million  an increase of million  or  from million in favorable foreign currency translation contributed approximately to our net sales gain 
rms global prices increased in a range up to with the weighted average increase approximately 
increased unit volume sales of both models and services added approximately to the net sales increase 
sales of our research models and services increased due to increased general price increases  increased market demand for our higher priced specialty units  increased units and greater demand for services in our foreign locations 
the rms sales increase was driven by increases in basic research and biotechnology spending which drove greater demand for our products and services 
preclinical services 
in  net sales from our preclinical services segment were million  an increase of million  or  compared to million in the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of inveresk in october and the increased customer demand in toxicology and other preclinical services 
our preclinical services business benefited from the growth of the preclinical market reflecting increased drug development efforts and customers outsourcing 
foreign currency contributed less than to the sales growth 
clinical services

cost of products sold and services provided 
cost of products sold and services provided in was million  an increase of million  or  from million in cost of products sold and services provided in was of net sales  compared to in with the improvement due to greater capacity utilization in the rms and preclinical services segments 
the acquired inveresk businesses cost of goods sold and services provided include the appropriate depreciation  facilities cost and other costs which is a refinement of their pre acquisition reporting where it was reported in selling  general and administrative expenses

selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses in were million  an increase of million  or  from million in selling  general and administrative expenses in were of net sales compared to of net sales in the increase was due primarily to the write off related to the closure of the proteomics business in the fourth quarter  the inveresk compensation charge for options and increased professional fees related to compliance with the internal control certification requirements of sarbanes oxley and inveresk integration costs 
research models and services 
selling  general and administrative expenses for rms in were million  an increase of million  or  compared to million in selling  general and administrative expenses increased slightly as a percentage of sales to in from in preclinical services 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the preclinical services segment in were million  an increase of million  or  compared to million in selling  general and administrative expenses in increased to of net sales  compared to of net sales in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in was due primarily to the impairment of the proteomics business  the inveresk compensation charge for stock options and increased professional fees related to the inveresk merger 
clinical services 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the clinical services segment in were million 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the clinical services segment were of net sales in unallocated corporate overhead 
unallocated corporate overhead  which consists of various corporate expenses including those associated with pension  executive salaries and departments such as corporate accounting  legal and investor relations  was million in  compared to million in the substantial increase in unallocated corporate overhead in was due to professional fees associated with the european reorganization  increased bonuses and increased professional fees related to compliance with internal control certification requirements of sarbanes oxley and the inveresk merger 
other operating expenses income 
during  we recorded a million charge in the preclinical services segment associated with the closure of a contract manufacturing facility 
also during  our french subsidiaries settled a breach of contract claim they had asserted against a customer 
after legal and related expenses  the net settlement amounted to a gain of approximately million which was recorded in the rms segment 
amortization of other intangibles 
amortization of other intangibles in was million  an increase of million  from million in the increased amortization is primarily due to the acquisition of inveresk 
research models and services 
in  amortization for our rms segment was million  a decrease of million from million in preclinical services 
in  amortization of other intangibles for our preclinical services segment was million  an increase of million from million in the increase in amortization of other intangibles was primarily due to the acquisition of inveresk

in  amortization for our clinical services segment was million due to the acquisition of inveresk 
operating income 
operating income in was million  an increase of million  or  from million in operating income in was of net sales  compared to of net sales in the decrease as a percent of sales is due primarily to the inveresk related amortization  the inveresk stock based compensation charge and the write off associated with the closure of the proteomics business 
research models and services 
in  operating income for our rms segment was million  an increase of million  or  from million in operating income as a percentage of net sales in was  compared to in the increase was primarily due to increased sales and a higher gross margin partially offset by the prior year gain on the settlement of a breach of contract claim of million or preclinical services 
in  operating income for our preclinical services segment was million  an increase of million  or  from million in operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to  compared to of net sales in the increase in operating income in was primarily due to increased customer demand  the acquisition of inveresk and a charge related to the write down of certain contract manufacturing assets in  partially offset by the increased amortization expense 
clinical services 
in  operating income for our clinical services segment was million 
operating income as a percentage of net sales was in interest expense 
interest expense in was million  compared to million in the million increase was primarily due to the increased borrowing as a result of the inveresk acquisition 
other income 
other income for was million compared to in the decrease was primarily due to less favorable foreign currency exchange rates in income taxes 
income tax expense for was million  an increase of million compared to million in our effective tax rate for was 
excluding charges associated with the deferred tax write off and the benefit from the reversal of the valuation allowance  the effective tax rate for was  compared to the effective tax rate of for net income 
net income in was million  an increase of million from million in fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales in were million  an increase of million  or  from million in the increase in net sales was primarily due to the increase in sales in our rms segment during research models services 
in  rms net sales were million  an increase of million  or  compared to million in favorable foreign currency translation contributed approximately to our net sales gain 
rms prices increased at certain geographical locations in a range up to with the weighted average increase of approximately 
increased unit volume sales of both models and services added approximately to the net sales growth 
research model unit sales increased primarily due to increased demand for our higher priced specialty units 
sales of our research model services increased in due to increased pricing  the consolidation of our mexican joint venture  an increased market demand and an increase in in vitro safety testing sales 
the rms increase was driven by basic research and biotechnology spending  which drove greater demand for our services that support research models  primarily transgenics and laboratory services 
this growth reflects the increasing number of new disease models being created and the corresponding need for sophisticated housing and related high value services 
preclinical services 
in  preclinical services segment net sales were million  an increase of million  or  from million in favorable foreign currency translation contributed approximately to our net sales gain 
preclinical services segment sales increased in primarily due to our acquisitions  partially offset by the impact of reduced market demand for toxicology services in early  lower sales in our biosafety testing services business  and the closure of our contract manufacturing facility 
the acquisitions of biolabs and springborn contributed million  or  to the net sales growth in during  preclinical services experienced pricing pressures due to decreased demand earlier in the year resulting in a nominal price decline for the year 
our preclinical services group recovered from the slower demand for toxicology services we experienced during late and early we believe there is still some excess capacity in certain segments of the market for outsourced development services  causing lingering price sensitivity 
cost of products sold and services provided 
cost of products sold and services provided in was million  an increase of million  or  from million in cost of products sold and services provided in was of net sales  compared to in the increase in cost of products sold and services provided was due primarily to adverse foreign currency exchange of approximately  increased product volume and general inflation 
the decrease in cost of products sold and services provided as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to better utilization of existing capacity and greater operating efficiencies 
research models services 
cost of products sold and services provided for rms in was million  an increase of million  or  compared to million in cost of products sold and services provided as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in the decrease in cost of product sold and services provided as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to better utilization of existing capacity and greater operating efficiencies  mainly in north american and european research models and research models services

in  operating income from our rms segment was million  an increase of million  or  from million in operating income in increased to of net sales  compared to of net sales in the increase in operating income in was primarily due to increased sales and higher gross margins primarily from improved capacity utilization  along with stable selling  general and administrative expenses and the settlement of the french lawsuit 
preclinical services 
in  operating income from our preclinical services segment was million  a decrease of million  or  from million in operating income from sales of preclinical services in was of net sales  compared to in the decrease in operating income in was primarily due to the decline in demand for these services which impacted gross margins  a charge related to the write down of certain contract manufacturing assets and a full year of amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions  partially offset by our cost containment program 
interest income 
interest income in was million  compared to million in the lower interest income was due primarily to lower interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense in was million  compared to million in the million decrease was primarily due to the early retirement of debt 
loss on debt retirement 
in  we recorded a loss of million relating to premiums paid and the write off of deferred financing costs and issuance discount in connection with the tender offer for all of our remaining senior subordinated notes  other debt repayments and the termination of our revolving credit facility 
other income 
other income for was million compared to million for the decrease was primarily due to lower net foreign currency gains then in income taxes 
the effective tax rate for was compared to the rate of  which included a million benefit associated with the release of a valuation allowance in during  we reassessed the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset associated with state net operating loss carryforwards due to state tax planning initiatives and the completion of the state income tax returns 
net income 
net income in was million  an increase of million or  from million in liquidity and capital resources fiscal compared to fiscal cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december   compared to million at december  net cash provided by operating activities in and was million and million  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operations was primarily due to increased net income  the non cash write off of the deferred tax asset in the first quarter of and increased deferred income 
in connection with the acquisition of inveresk  we have revised our days sales outstanding to include deferred revenue as an offset to accounts receivable in the calculation 
our days sales outstanding decreased to days as of december   from days as of december   primarily due to the acquisition of inveresk as well as improvements in other businesses 
net cash used in investing activities in and was million and million  respectively 
in we used cash of million to acquire inveresk and rvf 
our capital expenditures in were million of which million was related to rms  million related to preclinical services and million was related to clinical services 
for  we project capital expenditures to be approximately million 
in  cash of million provided by proceeds from sales of marketable security was partially offset by cash used to purchase marketable securities of million 
this compared to during which we used net cash of million to acquire an additional of equity of charles river japan and used million for capital expenditures of which million was used in rms and million was used in preclinical services  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities in was million and cash used by financing activities in was million 
during  to finance a portion of the inveresk acquisition  we entered into a credit agreement which provided a million term loan facility and a million revolving facility 
additionally  we borrowed and repaid million as part of our european reorganization 
in we made payments on our long term debt and capital lease obligations in the amount of million 
minimum future payments of our contractual obligations at december  are as follows contractual obligations total less than year years years after years debt interest payments capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations the contractual obligation for debt assumes the senior convertible debentures will be repurchased by us in when holders of the debentures may exercise the right to require such repurchase 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements during any of fiscal  or fiscal compared to fiscal cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december   compared to million at december  net cash provided by operating activities in and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by operations was primarily a result of the increase in accounts receivable and decrease in accrued compensation partially offset by the utilization of our deferred tax asset 
our revised days sales outstanding calculation includes the benefit of our deferred income 
our days sales outstanding decreased to days as of december   compared to days as of december  in addition  in we had a significant improvement in dso  which added million to cash flow 
net cash used in investing activities in and was million and million  respectively 
in we used million for capital expenditures  million for the purchase of marketable securities and million for the acquisition of an additional of the equity of charles river japan 
this compared to during which we used net cash of million to acquire biolabs and springborn and million for capital expenditures 
in  we made capital expenditures in rms and preclinical services which were million and million  respectively 
we anticipate that the future capital expenditures will be funded by cash provided by operating activities 
we continue to evaluate acquisitions to serve as growth platforms as evidenced by our acquisition of river valley farms rvf in january we have various options for financing future acquisitions  including our existing cash and investments  cash flow provided by operations  and our ability to raise capital through debt and equity financing 
net cash used in financing activities in was million  compared to net cash provided by financing activities in of million 
during  we received debt proceeds of million and repaid debt of million 
in  we issued million par value of senior convertible debentures and we used million of the proceeds to repay all of the senior subordinated notes and million to repay our outstanding senior secured credit facilities 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
revised  shared based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
this revised standard will be effective for us beginning with the third quarter in as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have an impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of the modified prospective adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be estimated at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk certain of our financial instruments are subject to market risks  including interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rates 
we generally do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
interest rate risk the fair value of our marketable securities is subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by basis points from levels at december   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by less than million 
on october   we entered into a credit agreement which provides for a million term loan facility and a million revolving facility 
our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in libor or the base rates which are used to determine the applicable interest rates under our term loan and revolving credit facility 
our potential loss over one year that would result from a hypothetical  instantaneous and unfavorable change of basis points in the interest rate would be approximately million on a pre tax basis 
the fair value of our senior convertible debenture is subject to interest rate risk and is impacted by our stock price 
the estimated fair value of our long term debt at december  was million 
fair values were determined from available market prices  using current interest rates and terms to maturity 
our senior convertible debentures accrue interest at an initial rate of  which will be reset but not below the initial rate of or above on august   august  and august  fluctuations in interest rates will not affect the interest payable on the senior convertible debentures  which is fixed through august  foreign currency exchange rate risk we also have exposure to some foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for the cash flows received from our foreign affiliates
