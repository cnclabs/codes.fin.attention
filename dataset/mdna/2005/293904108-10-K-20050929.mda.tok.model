our convertible notes are payable on july  results of operations fiscal years ended june    and revenues 
total revenues for the year ended june  were million compared to million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  the components of revenues are product sales  contract manufacturing revenue  royalties we earn on the sale of our products by others  and contract revenues 
net product sales for the year ended june  decreased by to million compared to million for the year ended june  the decrease in net product sales was attributable to a decline in north american sales of our intravenous antifungal product  abelcet  due to increasingly competitive market conditions 
during the year ended june   north american abelcet sales were million  as compared to million for the year ended june  oncaspar net sales increased to million for the year ended june   as compared to million for the year ended june  primarily due to a higher weighted average price 
adagen net sales were million  as compared million for the year ended june  the growth in adagen sales for the year ended june  was primarily driven by an increase in the number of patients over the prior year  as well as a higher weighted average price 
depocyt net sales were million for the year ended june   as compared to million for the year ended june  primarily due to increased demand  which reflects more focused sales and marketing efforts  and to a lesser extent a higher weighted average price 
net product sales for the year ended june  increased by to million  as compared to million for the year ended june  due to the acquisitions of the north american commercialization rights to abelcet and depocyt during the year ended june   as well as higher sales of oncaspar and adagen 
during the year ended june   north american abelcet sales were million  as compared to million for the year ended june  in november  we acquired the north american abelcet business from elan 
oncaspar net sales increased to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  oncaspar growth was primarily driven by increased demand  which reflects additional sales and marketing efforts to support oncaspar 
in june  we reacquired the north american rights to oncaspar from sanofi aventis 
net sales of adagen were million for the year ended june   as compared to million for the year ended june  adagen s growth reflects an increase in the number of patients receiving adagen therapy 
depocyt net sales were million for the year ended june   as compared to million for the year ended june  primarily due to our january acquisition of the north american commercialization rights to depocyt from skyepharma 
contract manufacturing revenue for the year ended june  was million compared to million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  contract manufacturing revenues were comprised of revenues from the manufacture of myocet and abelcet for the european market  and to a lesser extent the manufacture of an injectable multivitamin  mvi  for mayne 
our contract manufacturing revenue commenced in november  when we entered into a long term manufacturing and supply agreement with elan for the manufacture of myocet and abelcet for the european market in connection with our acquisition of the north american abelcet business 
during february  elan sold its european sales and marketing business to zeneus  which included the transfer of the manufacturing and supply agreement 
approximately million of the million of contract manufacturing revenue recorded during the year ended june  related to a payment of million from elan related to previously disputed invoices 
royalties for the year ended june  increased to million  as compared to million for the year ended june  royalties are primarily comprised of royalties we receive on sales of peg intron  a peg enhanced alpha interferon product that is marketed worldwide by schering plough for the treatment of hepatitis c 
the improvement in royalties over the prior year was due to the january launch of macugen in the us for the treatment of neovascular wet age related macular degeneration amd  an eye disease associated with aging that destroys central vision  and to a lesser extent the december launch of peg intron combination therapy in japan 
under a strategic alliance we formed in with nektar  nektar provides eyetech with pegylation technology for use in macugen and we receive a share of the royalties nektar receives from eyetech 
royalties for the year ended june  decreased to million compared to million for the year ended june  the decrease was primarily due to increased competition  as well as contracting market conditions 
in december  hoffmann la roche launched a pegylated interferon based combination therapy for hepatitis c that competes directly with schering plough s peg intron combination therapy 
prior to december  peg intron was the only approved pegylated interferon 
due to the december launch of peg intron combination therapy in japan  we believe royalties from sales of peg intron may continue to be positively impacted in the near term 
in september  hoffmann laroche reported that it received fast track review in japan for its pegylated interferon based combination therapy with approval expected in the third quarter of calendar in markets outside of japan  peg intron competes in a highly competitive market that schering plough has reported is experiencing contracting market conditions 
we cannot assure you that the positive impact of peg intron in japan will offset this market contraction and competitive conditions or that any particular sales levels of peg intron will be achieved or maintained 
since december  a new executive management team has been named and a significant focus is being placed on improving our revenues by supporting our four marketed brands  abelcet  oncaspar  adagen  and depocyt  and expanding their market potential through new initiatives 
despite our efforts  north american sales of abelcet may continue to be negatively impacted by the increasingly competitive conditions in the intravenous antifungal market due to the introduction of newer agents from pfizer  merck  and astellas  as well as increased pricing pressure in the lipid based amphotericin b market 
we cannot assure you that our efforts to support our products will be successful or that any particular sales levels of abelcet  oncaspar  adagen  and depocyt will be achieved or maintained 
contract revenues for the year ended june  increased to million  as compared to million for the year ended june  the increase was attributable to revenue related to an agreement with pharmagene plc to apply our proprietary peg technology to engineer an enhanced version of pharmagene s drug candidate  pgn contract revenues for the year ended june  were million  as compared to million for the year ended june  the increase was due to the recognition of revenue related to a million technology access fee  which we received in connection with a strategic collaboration with skyepharma formed in january the million payment is being recognized into income based on the term of the agreement 
we had export sales and royalties recognized on export sales of million for the year ended june   million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  of these amounts  sales in europe and royalties recognized on sales in europe  were million for the year ended june   million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  cost of sales and manufacturing revenue 
cost of sales and manufacturing revenue  as a percentage of net product sales and manufacturing revenue  increased to for the year ended june  as compared to for the year ended june  the increase was attributable to inventory write offs  as well as increased capacity costs 
cost of sales and manufacturing revenue  as a percentage of net product sales and manufacturing revenue  improved to for the year ended june  as compared to for the year ended june  the decrease was principally due to the higher inventory costs as a result of certain purchase accounting adjustments to the inventory acquired with the abelcet acquisition  which was sold during the year ended june   and million of manufacturing revenue for the year ended june  which related to a payment from elan for invoices that had no related cost of sales for the period 
research and development expense 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  patent filing fees  contractor and consulting fees  principally related to clinical and regulatory projects  costs related to research and development partnerships or licenses  drug supplies for clinical and preclinical activities  as well as other research supplies and allocated facilities charges 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended june   as compared to million for the year ended june  the increase was attributable to increased costs related to marqibo  which included the impact of a million payment related to the termination of our partnership with inex  as well as increased personnel related expenses 
these increases were offset in part by decreased spending related to clinical and preclinical development programs  which was primarily attributable to the termination of our clinical development program for pegamotecan 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended june   as compared to million for the year ended june  the increase was primarily due to increased spending related to i our antibody collaboration with micromet  ii our clinical development programs for pegamotecan and a us formulation of atg fresenius s  iii a partnership with inex for marqibo  iv preclinical programs  and v personnel related expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense

selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  increased to million  as compared to million in the increase was primarily due to increased sales and marketing expenses related to i the hiring of our north american sales force in connection with our acquisition of abelcet  ii the continued build out of a sales and marketing presence in oncology for oncaspar and depocyt  and iii personnel related expenses 
amortization 
amortization expense was million for the year ended june   as compared to million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  amortization expense is related to the intangible assets acquired in connection with the abelcet acquisition during november amortization of intangible assets is provided over their estimated lives ranging from years on a straight line basis

during the year ended june   we recorded a write down of the carrying value of our investment in micromet that resulted in a non cash charge of million 
in april  we entered into an agreement with micromet  which was amended in june  related to antibody based therapeutics 
in connection with the april agreement  we made an million investment in micromet in the form of a convertible note that is payable to us in march and bears interest at an annual rate of 
this note is convertible into micromet common stock at the election of either party 
our decision to write down the note was based on a decline in the estimated fair value of this investment that was deemed to be other than temporary 
during the year ended june   we recorded a write down of the carrying value of our investment in nektar that resulted in a non cash charge of million 
as part of our january agreement with nektar  we purchased million of newly issued nektar convertible preferred stock which is currently convertible into nektar common stock at a conversion price of per share 
under the cost method of accounting  investments are carried at cost and are adjusted only for other than temporary declines in fair value  and additional investments 
as a result of a continued decline in the price of nektar s common stock that was determined to be other than temporary  we recorded a write down of the carrying value of our investment in nektar 
the adjustment was calculated based on an assessment of the fair value of the investment at the time of the write down 
the estimated fair value of the nektar preferred stock was determined by multiplying the number of shares of common stock that would be received based on the conversion rate in place as of the date of the agreement per share by the closing price of nektar common stock on december   less a discount to reflect the fact that the shares were not convertible as of the december  valuation date 
acquired in process research and development 
acquired in process research and development for the year ended june  was million 
this expense was attributable to an up front payment that we made to inex related to the execution of a partnership for the clinical development of marqibo 
restructuring charge 
during the year ended june  we incurred charges totaling million pertaining to a realignment of our costs through a restructuring 
this decision was based on the aforementioned increasingly competitive conditions in the intravenous antifungal market  as well as the discontinuation of certain research and development projects 
the charges were primarily attributable to employee termination benefits 
other income expense 
other income expense for the year ended june  was an expense of million  as compared to income of million for the year ended june  and income of million for the year end june  other income expense includes net investment income  interest expense  and other income 
other income expense for the year ended june  also included income related to a merger termination fee 
net investment income for the year ended june  decreased by million to million  as compared to million for the year ended june  this decrease was principally due to the prior year s sale of  shares of nektar therapeutics common stock that resulted in a net gain of approximately million  which was recorded during the year ended june  this decrease in investment income was partially offset by a increase in interest income for the year ended june   as compared to the year ended june  net investment income for the year ended june  increased by million to million for the year ended june   as compared to million for the year ended june  the increase was primarily due to a net realized gain of million principally related to the sale of approximately of our investment in nektar 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in our interest bearing investments as a result of the previous year s purchase of the north american rights to abelcet in november for a cash payment of million plus acquisition costs  as well as a decrease in interest rates 
interest expense was million for each of the years ended june    and interest expense is related to the convertible subordinated notes  which were outstanding for each of the periods 
during the year ended june   we recorded nps merger termination income of million 
this amount reflects the aggregate consideration of million we received from nps in the form of nps common stock related to the termination of our proposed merger with nps in june net of million in costs incurred related to the proposed merger with nps primarily investment banking  legal  and accounting fees 
other income expense is primarily related to the million shares of nps common stock we received under a june merger termination agreement and a financial instrument we formed to reduce our exposure to the change in fair value associated with such shares  specifically a zero cost protective collar arrangement the collar 
for the year ended june   other expense was million  as compared to other income of million for the year ended june  during the year ended june   we recognized i a realized loss of million related to the sale and repurchase of  shares of nps common stock  ii an unrealized gain of million related to change in the fair value of the collar  and iii a realized loss of million related to the maturation of a portion of the collar and the sale of the underlying shares

for the year ended june   other income was million  as compared to other income of million for the year ended june  during the year ended june   we recognized i an unrealized gain of million related to the change in the fair value of our nps common stock ii a realized gain of million related to the sale and repurchase of million shares of nps common stock  and iii an unrealized gain of million related to change in the fair value of the collar 
there was million of other miscellaneous non operating income for the year ended june  income taxes 
during the year ended june   we recorded a non cash charge of million  which represents a full reserve against our existing deferred tax assets of million  a deferred tax liability charge of associated with our goodwill  as well as a million income tax provision for the twelve months ended june  this charge was determined based on our assessment of the likelihood that we will benefit from these assets 
realizing a benefit is ultimately dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income prior to the expiration of the tax benefits that are recognized as deferred tax assets on our balance sheet 
based on an analysis of the continued decline in our abelcet revenues  which reflect the previously mentioned competitive conditions in the intravenous antifungal market  as well as the potential impact these conditions may have on our future financial performance  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would not realize the tax benefits attributable to our deferred tax assets 
for the year ended june  we recognized a net tax expense of approximately million for federal and state purposes  as compared to net tax expense of million for the year ended june  income tax expense for the year ended june  is comprised of a tax provision for income taxes payable and a charge of million primarily related to an increase in our valuation allowance for certain research and development tax credits and capital losses based on our assessment that it was more likely than not that we would be able to utilize these assets 
during the year ended june   we sold approximately million of our state net operating loss carryforwards for proceeds of million which was recorded as a tax benefit and we purchased approximately million of gross state net operating loss carryforwards for million 
critical accounting policies in december  the sec requested that all registrants discuss their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the us all professional accounting standards effective as of june  have been taken into consideration in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
some of those estimates are subjective and complex  and  consequently  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following accounting policies have been highlighted as significant because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect our consolidated financial statements 
revenues from product sales and manufacturing revenue are recognized at the time of shipment and a provision is made at that time for estimated future credits  chargebacks  sales discounts  rebates and returns 
these sales provision accruals  except for rebates which are recorded as a liability  are presented as a reduction of the accounts receivable balances 
we continually monitor the adequacy of the accruals by comparing the actual payments to the estimates used in establishing the accruals 
we ship product to customers primarily fob shipping point and utilize the following criteria to determine appropriate revenue recognition pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  selling price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
the majority of our net product sales are to wholesale distributors who resell the products to the end customers 
we provide chargeback payments to these distributors based on their sales to members of buying groups at prices determined under a contract between enzon and the member 
administrative fees are paid to buying groups based on the total amount of purchases by their members 
chargeback amounts are based upon the volume of purchases multiplied by the difference between the wholesaler acquisition cost and the contract price for a product 
we estimate the amount of the chargeback that will be paid using historical trends  adjusted for current changes  and record the amounts as a reduction to accounts receivable and a reduction of gross sales when we record the sale of the product 
the settlement of the chargebacks generally occurs within three months after the sale to the wholesaler 
we regularly analyze the historical chargeback trends and make adjustments to recorded reserves for changes in trends 
in addition  state agencies  which administer various programs  such as the us medicaid and medicare program  also receive rebates 
medicaid rebates and administrative fees are recorded as a liability and a reduction of gross sales when we record the sale of the product 
medicaid rebates are typically paid within six to nine months after sale 
in determining the appropriate accrual amount we consider our historical medicaid rebate and administration fee payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trend 
current medicaid rebate laws and interpretations  and the percentage of our products that are sold to medicaid patients are also evaluated 
factors that complicate the rebate calculations are the timing of the average manufacturer pricing computation  the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate and the level of reimbursement by state agencies 
the following is a summary of reductions of gross sales accrued as of june  and june  the end of our last fiscal year june  june  accounts receivable reductions chargebacks   cash discounts other including returns total   accrued liabilities medicaid rebates   administrative fees total   there were no revisions to the estimates for gross to net sales adjustments that would be material to income from operations for the year ended june  and royalties under our license agreements with third parties are recognized when earned through the sale of the product by the licensor net of any estimated future credits  chargebacks  sales discount rebates and refunds 
contract revenues are recorded as the earnings process is completed 
non refundable milestone payments that represent the completion of a separate earnings process are recognized as revenue when earned  upon the occurrence of contract specified events and when the milestone has substance 
non refundable payments received upon entering into license and other collaborative agreements where we have continuing involvement are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the estimated service period 
under the asset and liability method of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets is provided for when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we believe that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will not be realized  including our net operating losses from operating activities and stock option exercises  based on future operations 
we assess the carrying value of our cost method investments in accordance with sfas no 
and sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
commencing with the first quarter of the year ended june  the company began evaluating its investments in accordance with eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
an impairment write down is recorded when a decline in the value of an investment is determined to be other than temporary 
these determinations involve a significant degree of judgment and are subject to change as facts and circumstances changes 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life acquired in a purchase business combination  are not subject to amortization  are tested at least annually for impairment  and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the company completed its annual goodwill impairment test during july  which indicated that goodwill was not impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
this determination is made at the company level because we are in one reporting unit and consists of two steps 
first  we determine the fair value of our reporting unit and compares it to the carrying amount 
second  if the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with fasb statement no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of our goodwill 
recoverability of amortizable intangible assets is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted net cash flow to be generated by the asset 
the evaluations involve amounts that are based on management s best estimate and judgment 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
if recorded values are less than the fair values  no impairment is indicated  however  if fair values are less than recorded values  we would record a charge for the impairment  such a charge may have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimated useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives 
through june   we applied the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  in accounting for its fixed plan stock options

 we elected to continue to apply the intrinsic value based method of accounting described above  and has adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 as amended 
when the exercise price of employee or director stock options is less than the fair value of the underlying stock on the grant date  we record deferred compensation for the difference and amortize this amount to expense over the vesting period of the options

previously required that most voluntary changes in an accounting principle be recognized by including the cumulative effect of the new accounting principle in net income of the period of the change 
sfas no 
now requires retrospective application of changes in an accounting principle to prior period financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in march  the fasb published fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  which clarifies that the term  conditional asset retirement obligations  as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
the interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of this interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first annual reporting period that begins after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we are required to adopt sfas r no later than july  under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we have evaluated the requirements of sfas r and determined the adoption of sfas r will result in a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
we have adopted the new standard effective july  and have selected the black scholes method of valuation for stock based compensation 
the charge will be distributed and reported in research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions sfas 
sfas eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph b of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
sfas specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas is effective for the fiscal periods beginning after june  we adopted sfas on july  and do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
among other provisions  the new rule requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal as stated in arb no 
additionally  sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  on july   we adopted sfas and do not expect its adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in response to the enactment of the american job creation act of the jobs act on october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  for the tax deduction provided to us based manufacturers by the american job creation act of fsp no 
clarifies how to apply sfas no 
to the new law s tax deduction for income attributable to domestic production activities 
the fully phased in deduction is up to nine percent of the lesser of taxable income or qualified production activities income 
the staff position requires that the deduction be accounted for as a special deduction in the period earned  not as a tax rate reduction 
as a result  we will recognize a reduction in our provision for income taxes for domestic production activities in the quarterly periods in which we are eligible for the deduction 
in march  the financial accounting standards board s fasb emerging issues task force eitf released issue  meaning of other than temporary impairment  which addressed other than temporary impairment for certain debt and equity investments 
various disclosure requirements of issue had been finalized previous to issuance and were required as of june  the recognition and measurement requirements of issue  and other disclosure requirements not already implemented  were effective for periods beginning after june  in september  the fasb staff issued fasb staff position fsp eitf  which delayed the effective date for certain measurement and recognition guidance contained in issue the fsp requires the application of pre existing other than temporary guidance during the period of delay until a final consensus is reached 
the disclosure requirements set forth in issue were not delayed as a result of the issued fsp 
our management does not anticipate the issuance of the final consensus will have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
risk factors our business is heavily dependent on the continued sales of peg intron and abelcet 
if revenues from either of these products fail to increase or materially decline  our financial condition and results of operations will be materially harmed 
our results of operations are heavily dependent on the revenues derived from the sale and marketing of peg intron and abelcet 
under our agreement with schering plough  pursuant to which schering plough applied our peg technology to develop a modified form of schering plough s intron a  we are receiving royalties on worldwide sales of peg intron 
during the fiscal year ended june   total royalties comprised approximately of our total revenues 
during  hoffmann la roche received fda and european union approval for pegasys  which competes with peg intron in all international markets 
the launch of pegasys has led to greater competitive pressure on peg intron sales 
pegasys has continued to take market share away from peg intron and the overall market for pegylated alpha interferon for the treatment of hepatitis c has been contracting 
as a result  sales of peg intron in certain markets where it competes with pegasys and the royalties we receive on those sales have declined 
we cannot assure you that pegasys will not continue to gain market share at the expense of peg intron which could result in lower peg intron sales and lower royalties to us 
although during the year ended june   schering plough received approval for and launched peg intron in japan  in combination with rebetol for the treatment of hepatitis c  there can be no assurance that schering plough will successfully market peg intron in japan 
in september  hoffmann laroche reported that pegasys combination therapy would receive a fast track review in japan and approval is expected during the third quarter of calendar hoffmann la roche s subsidiary chugai pharmaceutical co 
ltd currently markets other pharmaceutical products in japan 
even if schering plough continues to be successful marketing peg intron in japan  it is likely that the future launch in japan of hoffmann la roche s competing pegylated interferon based combination therapy will have a negative impact on peg intron s japanese market share and sales 
schering plough is responsible for conducting and funding the clinical studies  obtaining regulatory approval  manufacturing and marketing peg intron on an exclusive basis 
currently  schering plough markets peg intron worldwide both as a monotherapy and as a combination therapy for the treatment of hepatitis c 
if schering plough fails to effectively market peg intron or discontinues the marketing of peg intron for these indications  this would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
even though the use of peg intron as a stand alone therapy and as combination therapy with rebetol has received fda approval  we cannot assure you that schering plough will be successful in marketing peg intron or that schering plough will not continue to market intron a  either as a stand alone product or in combination therapy with rebetol 
the amount and timing of resources dedicated by schering plough to the marketing of peg intron is not within our control 
if schering plough breaches or terminates its agreement with us  the commercialization of peg intron could be slowed or blocked completely 
in addition  any ensuing dispute between us and schering plough would be expensive and time consuming  which could have a material  adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our revenues will be negatively affected if schering plough continues to market intron a in competition with peg intron or if it cannot meet the manufacturing demands of the market 
in  schering plough was unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of peg intron to meet market demand due to overwhelming demand for the peg intron and ribavirin combination therapy 
as a result  schering plough implemented a temporary wait list program for newly enrolled patients in order to ensure uninterrupted access for those patients already using peg intron 
as of october   the wait list was terminated as a sufficient quantity of peg intron and ribavirin was available to meet market demand 
during the year ended june   net sales of abelcet in north america accounted for million or approximately of our total revenues and we expect that abelcet will account for a significant portion of our future total revenues 
the continued sale of newer products from merck and pfizer in the antifungal market  as well as the entry of a new product from astellas pharma formerly fujisawa healthcare  inc  is currently negatively impacting abelcet sales  as clinicians explore the use of these other therapeutic agents 
vicuron pharmaceuticals  which in september was acquired by pfizer  is expected to obtain approval for and introduce an additional new product in the antifungal market within the next year 
in addition  astellas pharma and gilead pharmaceuticals are currently marketing ambisome  and three rivers pharmaceuticals  inc is marketing amphotec  each of which is a lipid based version of amphotericin b  for the treatment of fungal infections 
ambisome and amphotec compete with abelcet and sales of these competitive products have resulted in greater competitive pressure on abelcet sales 
during the fiscal year ended june   we began to experience increasing pricing pressure with respect to abelcet 
in particular  astellas pharma and gilead sciences  inc  have aggressively lowered the price of their product in certain regions and for certain customers in the us this has resulted in the shrinkage or loss of certain of our customer accounts 
we are developing strategies to address this competitive threat  but there can be no assurance as to when or whether we will be successful in stopping or reversing this trend 
during the year ended june   north american abelcet sales decreased by million or to million  as compared to million for the year ended june  while we are developing and implementing strategies to address the competitive threats facing abelcet  we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase sales of abelcet or prevent further decreases in abelcet sales 
we incurred a loss for the fiscal year ending june   and we expect to incur losses over the next several years 
prior to the fiscal year ended june   we had incurred substantial losses 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
although we earned a profit for the fiscal years ended june   and  during the fiscal year ended june  we incurred a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended june  our net loss in was primarily the result of lower sales of abelcet and an million charge we incurred to increase our valuation allowance associated with our deferred tax assets based upon our assessment that it was not more likely than not that we would benefit from these assets 
both the lower abelcet sales and such increases in our valuation allowance were caused by increasingly competitive conditions in the intravenous antifungal market 
we are currently investing in new programs to better support abelcet and our other marketed brands  however  we cannot predict the ultimate success of such programs or when our business will return to profitability 
our ability to return to profitability will depend primarily on schering plough s effective marketing of peg intron and our effective marketing of abelcet  as well as on the rate of growth in our other product sales or royalty revenue and on the level of our expenses 
our ability to achieve long term profitability will depend upon our and our licensees ability to obtain regulatory approvals for additional product candidates 
even if our product candidates receive regulatory approval  we cannot assure you that our products will achieve market acceptance or will be commercialized successfully or that our operations will sustain profitability 
we are subject to extensive regulation 
compliance with these regulations can be costly  time consuming and subject us to unanticipated delays in developing our products 
the regulatory approval process is highly uncertain and we may not successfully secure approval for new products 
the manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products in the us and abroad are subject to stringent governmental regulation 
the sale of any of our products for use in humans in the us will require the prior approval of the fda 
similar approvals by comparable agencies are required in most foreign countries 
the fda has established mandatory procedures and safety standards that apply to the clinical testing  manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products 
obtaining fda approval for a new therapeutic product may take several years and involve substantial expenditures 
adagen was approved by the fda in oncaspar was approved in the us and in germany in for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who are hypersensitive to native forms of l asparaginase 
oncaspar was approved in russia in april for therapeutic use in a broad range of cancers 
peg intron was approved in europe and the us for the treatment of hepatitis c in may and january  respectively 
abelcet received us approval in november and canadian approval in september depocyt received us approval in april except for these approvals  none of our other products has been approved for sale and use in humans in the us or elsewhere 
we cannot assure you that we or our licensees will be able to obtain or maintain fda or other relevant marketing approval for any of our other products 
in addition  any approved products are subject to continuing regulation 
if we or our licensees fail to comply with applicable requirements it could result in o criminal penalties  o civil penalties  o fines  o recall or seizure  o injunctions requiring suspension of production  o orders requiring ongoing supervision by the fda  or o refusal by the government to approve marketing or export applications or to allow us to enter into supply contracts 
if we or our licensees fail to obtain or maintain requisite governmental approvals or fail to obtain or maintain approvals of the scope requested  it will delay or preclude us or our licensees or marketing partners from marketing our products 
it could also limit the commercial use of our products 
any such failure or limitation may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have experienced problems complying with the fda s regulations for manufacturing our products  and have had to conduct voluntary recalls of certain of our products 
these problems could materially harm our business 
manufacturers of drugs also must comply with the applicable fda current good manufacturing practice cgmp regulations  which include quality control and quality assurance requirements as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation 
manufacturing facilities are subject to ongoing periodic inspection by the fda and corresponding state agencies  including unannounced inspections  and must be licensed as part of the product approval process before they can be used in commercial manufacturing 
we or our present or future suppliers may be unable to comply with the applicable cgmp regulations and other fda regulatory requirements 
we manufacture abelcet  oncaspar and adagen 
schering plough is responsible for manufacturing peg intron and skyepharma is responsible for manufacturing depocyt 
adagen and oncaspar use our earlier peg technology which tends to be less stable than the peg technology used in peg intron and our products under development 
due  in part  to the drawbacks in the earlier technologies we have had and may continue to have manufacturing problems with these products 
manufacturing and stability problems required us to implement voluntarily recalls for one adagen batch in march and certain batches of oncaspar in june  july  september  and march to date  we have been unable to identify the cause of the manufacturing and stability problems related to the batches of oncaspar that we voluntarily recalled in july  september  and march in addition to voluntary recalls  mandatory recalls can also take place if regulators or courts require them  even if we believe our products are safe and effective 
recalls result in lost sales of the recalled products themselves  and can result in further lost sales while replacement products are manufactured or due to customer dissatisfaction 
we cannot assure you that future product recalls will not materially adversely affect our business  our financial conditions  results of operations or our reputation and relationships with our customers 
during  we experienced manufacturing problems with oncaspar 
the problems were due to increased levels of white particulates in batches of oncaspar  which resulted in an increased rejection rate for this product 
during this period we agreed with the fda to temporary labeling and distribution restrictions for oncaspar and instituted additional inspection and labeling procedures prior to distribution 
in november  as a result of manufacturing changes we implemented  the fda withdrew this distribution restriction 
in july  the fda conducted an inspection of our manufacturing facility in connection with our product license for adagen 
following that inspection  the fda documented several deviations from cgmp in a form report 
we provided the fda with a corrective action plan 
in november  the fda issued a warning letter citing the same cgmp deviations listed in the july form  but it also stated that the fda was satisfied with our proposed corrective actions 
as a result of the deviations  the fda decided not to approve product export requests from us for oncaspar until it determined that all noted cgmp deviations were either corrected or in the process of being corrected 
this restriction was removed in august since november  the fda and the mhra  the british equivalent of the fda  have conducted follow up inspections  as well as routine inspections of our manufacturing facilities related to abelcet  oncaspar and adagen 
following certain of these inspections  the fda has issued form reports citing deviations from cgmp  the most recent ones of which were issued in october for our new jersey facility and august for our indianapolis facility 
we have or are in the process of responding to such reports with corrective action plans 
we are aware that the fda has conducted inspections of certain of the manufacturing facilities of schering plough  and those inspections have resulted in the issuance of form s citing deviations from cgmp 
if we or our partners  including schering plough  face additional manufacturing problems in the future or if we or our licensees are unable to satisfactorily resolve current or future manufacturing problems  the fda could require us or our licensees to discontinue the distribution of our products or to delay continuation of clinical trials 
in addition  if we or our licensees  including schering plough  cannot market and distribute our products for an extended period  sales of the products and customer relationships will suffer  which would adversely affect our financial results 
our clinical trials could take longer to complete and cost more than we expect 
we will need to conduct significant additional clinical studies of all of our product candidates  which have not yet been approved for sale 
these studies are costly  time consuming and unpredictable 
any unanticipated costs or delays in our clinical studies could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a phase clinical trial is being conducted for peg intron for one cancer indication 
peg intron is also being evaluated in a number of earlier stage investigator sponsored clinical trials for other cancer indications 
clinical trials are also being conducted for peg intron as a long term maintenance therapy the copilot study and separately as combination therapy with rebetol in patients with chronic hepatitis c who did not respond to or had relapsed following previous interferon based therapy 
we are currently conducting a double blind  randomized phase dose ranging study for atg fresenius s 
the rate of completion of clinical trials depends upon many factors  including the rate of enrollment of patients 
the enrollment of patients and the intensifying competitiveness of patient recruitment activities is increasingly a delaying factor in the completion of clinical trials 
if we or the other sponsors of these clinical trials are unable to recruit sufficient clinical patients in such trials during the appropriate period  such trials may be delayed and will likely incur significant additional costs 
in addition  fda or institutional review boards may require us to delay  restrict  or discontinue our clinical trials on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
the cost of human clinical trials varies dramatically based on a number of factors  including o the order and timing of clinical indications pursued  o the extent of development and financial support from corporate collaborators  o the number of patients required for enrollment  o the difficulty of obtaining clinical supplies of the product candidate  and o the difficulty in obtaining sufficient patient populations and clinicians 
all statutes and regulations governing the conduct of clinical trials are subject to change in the future  which could affect the cost of our clinical trials 
any unanticipated costs or delays in our clinical studies could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  we rely on corporate collaborators or academic institutions to conduct some or all aspects of clinical trials involving our product candidates 
we will have less control over the timing and other aspects of these clinical trials than if we conducted them entirely on our own 
we cannot assure you that these trials will commence or be completed as we expect or that they will be conducted successfully 
we depend on third parties in the conduct of clinical trials and any failure of those parties to fulfill their obligations could adversely affect our development and commercialization plans 
we depend on independent clinical investigators  contract research organizations  and other third party service providers in the conduct of clinical trials 
we rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials  but do not control many aspects of their activities 
for example  the clinical investigators are not our employees 
however  we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial 
third parties may not complete activities on schedule  or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols 
the failure of these third parties to carry out their obligations could delay or prevent the development and commercialization of future product candidates 
if preclinical and clinical trials do not yield positive results  our product candidates will fail 
if preclinical and clinical testing of one or more of our product candidates does not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of product candidates for the desired indications  those potential products will fail 
numerous unforeseen events may arise during  or as a result of  the testing process  including the following o the results of preclinical studies may be inconclusive  or they may not be indicative of results that will be obtained in human clinical trials  o potential products may not have the desired effect or may have undesirable side effects or other characteristics that preclude regulatory approval or limit their commercial use if approved  o results attained in early human clinical trials may not be indicative of results that are obtained in later clinical trials  and o after reviewing test results  we or our strategic partners may abandon projects which we might previously have believed to be promising 
clinical testing is very costly and can take many years 
the failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a therapeutic product under development would delay or prevent regulatory approval  which could adversely affect our business and financial performance 
even if we obtain regulatory approval for our products  they may not be accepted in the marketplace 
the commercial success of our products will depend upon their acceptance by the medical community and third party payors as clinically useful  cost effective and safe 
even if our products obtain regulatory approval  we cannot assure you that they will achieve market acceptance of any kind 
the degree of market acceptance will depend on many factors  including o the receipt  timing and scope of regulatory approvals  o the timing of market entry in comparison with potentially competitive products  o the availability of third party reimbursement  and o the establishment and demonstration in the medical community of the clinical safety  efficacy and cost effectiveness of drug candidates  as well as their advantages over existing technologies and therapeutics 
if any of our products do not achieve market acceptance  we will likely lose our entire investment in that product  giving rise to a material  adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on our collaborative partners 
if we lose our collaborative partners or they do not apply adequate resources to our collaborations  our product development and financial performance may suffer 
we rely heavily and will depend heavily in the future on collaborations with collaborative partners  primarily pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  for one or more of the research  development  manufacturing  marketing and other commercialization activities relating to many of our product candidates 
if we lose our collaborative partners  or if they do not apply adequate resources to our collaborations  our product development and financial performance may suffer 
the amount and timing of resources dedicated by our collaborators to their collaborations with us is not within our control 
if any collaborator breaches or terminates its agreements with us  or fails to conduct its collaborative activities in a timely manner  the commercialization of our product candidates could be slowed or blocked completely 
we cannot assure you that our collaborative partners will not change their strategic focus or pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products as a means for developing treatments for the diseases targeted by these collaborative programs 
our collaborators could develop competing products 
in addition  our revenues will be affected by the effectiveness of our corporate partners in marketing any successfully developed products 
for example  our royalty revenues relating to peg intron have been negatively impacted by peg intron s loss of market share to roche s pegasys 
we cannot assure you that our collaborations will be successful 
disputes may arise between us and our collaborators as to a variety of matters  including financing obligations under our agreements and ownership of intellectual property rights 
these disputes may be both expensive and time consuming and may result in delays in the development and commercialization of products 
we purchase some of the compounds utilized in our products from a single source or a limited group of suppliers  and the partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers could cause production delays and a substantial loss of revenues 
we purchase the unmodified compounds and bulk pegs utilized in our approved products and products under development from outside suppliers 
we may be required to enter into supply contracts with outside suppliers for certain unmodified compounds 
for example  we have agreements with merck co  inc and kyowa hakko to produce the unmodified forms of l asparaginase used in the manufacture of oncaspar 
we purchase the unmodified adenosine deaminase enzyme used in the manufacturing of adagen from roche diagnostics  however  we no longer have a supply agreement with roche diagnostics 
we have two suppliers that produce the amphotericin b used in the manufacture of abelcet  bristol myers squibb and alpharma aps we have a supply agreement with bristol myers squibb  but not with alpharma 
if we experience a delay in obtaining or are unable to obtain any unmodified compound including unmodified adenosine deaminase  unmodified l asparaginase or amphotericin b  on reasonable terms  or at all  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we purchase the lipids used in the manufacture of abelcet and the pegs used in the manufacture of oncaspar and adagen from a limited number of suppliers 
we do not have formal supply agreements with any of these suppliers 
no assurance can be given that alternative suppliers with appropriate regulatory authorizations could be readily identified if necessary 
if we experience delays in obtaining or are unable to obtain any such raw materials on reasonable terms  or at all  it could have a material  adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are required to obtain an alternate source for an unmodified compound utilized in a product  the fda and relevant foreign regulatory agencies will likely require that we perform additional testing to demonstrate that the alternate material is biologically and chemically equivalent to the unmodified compound previously used in our clinical trials 
this testing could delay or stop development of a product  limit commercial sales of an approved product and cause us to incur significant additional expenses 
if we are unable to demonstrate that the alternate material is chemically and biologically equivalent to the previously used unmodified compound  we will likely be required to repeat some or all of the preclinical and clinical trials conducted for the compound 
the marketing of an fda approved drug could be disrupted while such tests are conducted 
even if the alternate material is shown to be chemically and biologically equivalent to the previously used compound  the fda or relevant foreign regulatory agency may require that we conduct additional clinical trials with the alternate material 
the period covered by our supply agreement with merck for l asparaginase for the manufacture of oncaspar for the north american market will conclude on december  if we are unable to successfully renew our supply agreement for l asparaginase for the north american market  it will have a potentially negative impact on our business and results of operations 
roche diagnostics  which is based in germany  is the only fda approved supplier of the adenosine deaminase enzyme  or ada  used in adagen 
during we obtained fda approval of the use of the ada enzyme obtained from bovine intestines from cattle of new zealand origin 
new zealand currently certifies that its cattle are bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease free 
beginning in september  the us department of agriculture usda required all animal sourced materials shipped to the us from any european country to contain a veterinary certificate that the product is bse free  regardless of the country of origin 
in september  roche diagnostics notified us that it has elected to terminate our ada supply agreement 
we are currently seeking to develop recombinant ada as an alternative to the bovine derived product 
this is a difficult and expensive undertaking as to which success cannot be assured 
roche diagnostics has indicated that it will continue to supply us with our requirements of ada for a reasonable period of time after termination of our supply agreement as we work to develop another source of ada 
if we are unable to secure an alternative source of ada before roche diagnostics discontinues supplying the material to us  we will likely experience inventory shortages and potentially a period of product unavailability and or a long term inability to produce adagen 
if this occurs  it will have a measurable and potentially material negative impact on our business and results of operations and it could potentially result in significant reputational harm and regulatory difficulties 
we have received a notice from bristol myers squibb company bms terminating our amphotericin b supply agreement with bms effective march  we currently have an alternative source of supply of amphotericin b and are seeking to qualify at least one additional source of supply 
the termination by bms may give rise to future increased costs for the acquisition of amphotericin b  as well as increased capital expenditures related to readying a new supplier s facilities for cgmp production and regulatory approval of abelcet incorporating the alternative amphotericin b 
although there can be no assurance as to the timing of these increased costs and additional capital expenditures  we anticipate that these may be incurred beginning in calendar the fda recently conducted an inspection of the manufacturing facility of merck co  inc  and that inspection resulted in the issuance on july   of a form citing deviations from cgmp 
if merck is unable to satisfactorily resolve its current or future manufacturing problems  the fda could require merck to discontinue the manufacture and distribution of the unmodified form of l asparaginase used in the manufacture of oncaspar  which could require us to discontinue the manufacture and distribution of oncaspar 
in addition  if we cannot market and distribute oncaspar for an extended period  sales of the product and customer relationships will suffer  which would adversely affect our financial results 
the us and foreign patents upon which our original peg technology was based have expired 
we depend on patents and proprietary rights  which may offer only limited protection against potential infringement and the development by our competitors of competitive products 
research corporation technologies  inc held the patent upon which our original peg technology was based and had granted us a license under such patent 
research corporation s patent contained broad claims covering the attachment of peg to polypeptides 
however  this us patent and its corresponding foreign patents expired in december based upon the expiration of the research corporation patent  other parties will be permitted to make  use or sell products covered by the claims of the research corporation patent  subject to other patents  including those which we hold 
we have obtained numerous patents with claims covering improved methods of attaching or linking peg to therapeutic compounds 
we cannot assure you that any of these patents will enable us to prevent infringement or that competitors will not develop alternative methods of attaching peg to compounds potentially resulting in competitive products outside the protection that may be afforded by our patents 
we are aware that others have also filed patent applications and have been granted patents in the us and other countries with respect to the application of peg to proteins and other compounds 
however  other than hoffmann la roche s pegasys  we are unaware of any other pegylated products that compete with our pegylated products 
the expiration of the research corporation patent or other patents related to peg that have been granted to third parties may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the pharmaceutical industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies  products and processes 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to develop and maintain a strong patent position for our products and technologies both in the us and in other countries 
we have been issued patents in the us  of which are currently active and many of which have foreign counterparts 
these patents  if extensions are not granted  are expected to expire beginning in through we have also filed and currently have pending patent applications in the us under our license agreements  we have access to large portions of micromet s and nektar s patent estates as well as a small number of individually licensed patents 
of the patents owned or licensed by us  relate to peg intron  relate to abelcet  and relate to depocyt 
although we believe that our patents provide certain protection from competition  we cannot assure you that such patents will be of substantial protection or commercial benefit to us  will afford us adequate protection from competing products  or will not be challenged or declared invalid 
in addition  we cannot assure you that additional us patents or foreign patent equivalents will be issued to us 
the scope of patent claims for biotechnological inventions is uncertain  and our patents and patent applications are subject to this uncertainty 
to facilitate development of our proprietary technology base  we may need to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights from other parties 
if we are unable to obtain such licenses  our product development efforts may be delayed or blocked 
we are aware that certain organizations are engaging in activities that infringe certain of our peg and sca technology patents 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to enforce our patent and other rights against such organizations 
we expect that there will continue to be significant litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries regarding patents and other proprietary rights 
we have in the past been involved in patent litigation  and we may likely become involved in additional patent litigation in the future 
we may incur substantial costs in asserting any patent rights and in defending suits against us related to intellectual property rights 
such disputes could substantially delay our product development or commercialization activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also rely on trade secrets  know how and continuing technological advancements to protect our proprietary technology 
we have entered into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  advisors and collaborators 
however  these parties may not honor these agreements  and we may not be able to successfully protect our rights to unpatented trade secrets and know how 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and know how 
our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others  which could increase our costs and negatively affect our profitability 
our success also depends on avoiding infringement of the proprietary technologies of others 
in particular  there may be certain issued patents and patent applications claiming subject matter which we or our collaborators may be required to license in order to research  develop or commercialize at least some of our products 
in addition  third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us 
an adverse outcome in these proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require us to cease or modify the use of our technology 
if we are required to license such technology  we cannot assure you that a license under such patents and patent applications will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
further  we may incur substantial costs defending ourselves in lawsuits against charges of patent infringement or other unlawful use of another s proprietary technology 
we have limited marketing and distribution capabilities 
although we have a person us pharmaceutical sales and marketing organization to support our products  we may be required to seek one or more corporate partners to augment our marketing and sales efforts with respect to future products 
any delay in developing these resources could substantially delay or curtail the marketing of such products 
in our sales or marketing efforts  we may compete with other companies that currently have extensive sales operations 
our marketing and sales efforts may be unable to compete successfully against such other companies 
in addition  we have an agreement with nova factor  inc to purchase and distribute adagen  oncaspar and depocyt in the us and canada 
if nova factor does not perform its obligations  our ability to distribute those products may be severely restricted 
we may acquire other companies or products and may be unable to successfully integrate such companies with our operations 
we may expand and diversify our operations with acquisitions 
if we are unsuccessful in integrating any such company or product with our operations  or if integration is more difficult than anticipated  we may experience disruptions that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
some of the risks that may affect our ability to integrate or realize any anticipated benefits from any acquisition include those associated with o unexpected losses of key employees or customers of the acquired company  o conforming the acquired company s standards  processes  procedures and controls with our operations  o coordinating our new product and process development  o diversion of existing management relating to the integration and operation of the acquired company  o hiring additional management and other critical personnel  and o increasing the scope  geographic diversity and complexity of our operations 
we may need to obtain additional financing to meet our future capital needs  and this financing may not be available when we need it 
our current development projects require substantial capital 
we may require substantial additional funds to conduct research activities  preclinical studies  clinical trials and other activities relating to the successful commercialization of potential products 
in addition  we may seek to acquire additional products  technologies and companies  which could require substantial capital 
in addition  we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to obtain significant revenue from peg intron 
additional funds from other sources may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are unavailable from operations or additional sources of financing  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or one or more of our proposed acquisitions of technologies or companies which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operations 
while we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and investments will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future  our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  including o the level of revenues we receive from our fda approved products and product candidates  o continued progress of our research and development programs  o our ability to establish additional collaborative arrangements  o changes in our existing collaborative relationships  o progress with preclinical studies and clinical trials  o the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory clearance for our products  o the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  o competing technological and market developments  and o our ability to market and distribute our products and establish new collaborative and licensing arrangements 
we may seek to raise any necessary additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or other sources which may be dilutive to existing stockholders 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to o delay  reduce the scope or eliminate one or more of our development projects  o obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves  or o license rights to technologies  product candidates or products on terms that are less favorable to us than might otherwise be available 
we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel  which would harm our business 
because of the specialized scientific nature of our business  we are highly dependent upon qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel including our chief executive officer 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical field  therefore  we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business 
although we have employment agreements with our chief executive officer and certain other executive officers  our ability to continue to retain such officers  as well as other senior executives or key managers is not assured 
the loss of the services of one or a combination of our senior executives or key managers  particularly our chief executive officer  as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific  technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner  would have an adverse effect on our business 
risks related to our industry we face rapid technological change and intense competition  which could harm our business and results of operations 
the biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid technological change 
our future success will depend on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to technological advances 
rapid technological development by others may result in our products and technologies becoming obsolete 
many of our competitors have substantially greater research and development capabilities and experience and greater manufacturing  marketing and financial resources than we do 
accordingly  our competitors may develop technologies and products that are superior to those we or our collaborators are developing and render our technologies and products or those of our collaborators obsolete and noncompetitive 
in addition  many of our competitors have much more experience than we do in preclinical testing and human clinical trials of new drugs  as well as obtaining fda and other regulatory approval 
if we cannot compete effectively  our business and financial performance would suffer 
we face intense competition from established biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  as well as academic and research institutions that are pursuing competing technologies and products 
we know that competitors are developing or manufacturing various products that are used for the prevention  diagnosis or treatment of diseases that we have targeted for product development 
for example  hoffmann la roche s pegasys has received fda and european union approval for treatment of hepatitis c as a monotherapy and in combination with ribavirin 
pegasys competes with peg intron in the us and the european union and has led to intensive competitive pressure on peg intron sales 
since its launch  pegasys has taken market share away from peg intron and the overall market for pegylated alpha interferon in the treatment of hepatitis c has not increased sufficiently so as offset the effect the increasing pegasys sales have had on sales of peg intron 
as a result  quarterly sales of peg intron in the markets where it competes with pegasys and the royalties we receive on those sales have been negatively impacted in recent quarters 
we cannot assure you that pegasys will not continue to gain market share at the expense of peg intron which could result in lower peg intron sales and lower royalties to us 
similarly  astellas pharma and gilead pharmaceuticals are currently marketing ambisome  and three rivers pharmaceuticals is marketing amphotec  each of which is a lipid based version of amphotericin  for the treatment of fungal infections 
ambisome and amphotec compete with abelcet and sales of these competitive products have resulted in intensive competitive pressure on abelcet sales 
depocyt  an injectable  sustained release formulation of the chemotherapeutic agent cytarabine for the treatment of lymphomatous meningitis  competes with the generic drugs  cytarabine and methotrexate  and oncaspar  a peg enhanced version of a naturally occurring enzyme called l asparaginase  competes with elspar r asparaginase to treat patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
existing and future products  therapies and technological approaches will compete directly with our products 
current and prospective competing products may provide greater therapeutic benefits for a specific problem or may offer comparable performance at a lower cost 
any product candidate that we develop and that obtains regulatory approval must then compete for market acceptance and market share 
our product candidates may not gain market acceptance among physicians  patients  healthcare payors and the medical community 
we may be subject to a variety of types of product liability or other claims based on allegations that the use of our products has resulted in adverse effects  whether by participants in our clinical trials or by patients using our products 
although we maintain product liability insurance for claims arising from the use of our products in clinical trials prior to fda approval and for claims arising from the use of our products after fda approval at levels that we believe are appropriate  we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our existing insurance coverage or obtain additional coverage on commercially reasonable terms for the use of our other products in the future 
also  our insurance coverage and our resources may not be sufficient to satisfy any liability resulting from product liability claims  and a product liability claim may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
because of the uncertainty of pharmaceutical pricing  reimbursement and healthcare reform measures  we may be unable to sell our products profitably in the us the availability of reimbursement by governmental and other third party payors affects the market for any pharmaceutical product 
in recent years  there have been numerous proposals to change the healthcare system in the us and further proposals are likely 
some of these proposals have included measures that would limit or eliminate payments for medical procedures and treatments or subject the pricing of pharmaceuticals to government control 
in addition  government and private third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both the coverage and the level of reimbursement of drug products 
for example  under the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of the act  medicare benefits will be primarily provided through private entities that will attempt to negotiate price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers  which may increase pressure to lower prescription drug prices 
the act also includes other cost containment measures for medicare in the event medicare cost increases exceed a certain level  which measures may impose limitations on prescription drug prices 
these changes in medicare reimbursement could have a negative impact on our revenues derived from sales of our products 
moreover  significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products 
our ability to commercialize our products will depend  in part  on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of the products and related treatments will be available from third party payors 
if we or any of our collaborators succeeds in bringing one or more products to market  we cannot assure you that third party payors will establish and maintain price levels sufficient for realization of an appropriate return on our investment in product development 
in addition  lifetime limits on benefits included in most private health plans may force patients to self pay for treatment 
for example  patients who receive adagen are expected to require injections for their entire lives 
the cost of this treatment may exceed certain plan limits and cause patients to self fund further treatment 
furthermore  inadequate third party coverage may lead to reduced market acceptance of our products 
significant changes in the healthcare system in the us or elsewhere could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 
risks related to our subordinated notes and common stock the price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  volatile which may significantly affect the trading price of our notes 
historically  the market price of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range  and it is likely that the price of our common stock will fluctuate in the future 
the market price of our common stock could be impacted due to a variety of factors  including o the results of preclinical testing and clinical trials by us  our corporate partners or our competitors  o announcements of technical innovations or new products by us  our corporate partners or our competitors  o the status of corporate collaborations and supply arrangements  o regulatory approvals  o government regulation  o developments in patent or other proprietary rights  o public concern as to the safety and efficacy of products developed by us or others  o litigation  o acts of war or terrorism in the us or worldwide  and o general market conditions in our industry 
in addition  due to one or more of the foregoing factors in one or more future quarters  our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the market price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected 
the stock market has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations have especially affected the market price of the stock of many high technology and healthcare related companies 
such fluctuations have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
nonetheless  these broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
our notes are subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness 
our convertible subordinated notes are unsecured and subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness 
in the event of our bankruptcy  liquidation or reorganization  or upon acceleration of the notes due to an event of default under the indenture and in certain other events  our assets will be available to pay obligations on the notes only after all senior indebtedness has been paid 
as a result  there may not be sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts due on any or all of the outstanding notes 
we are not prohibited from incurring debt  including senior indebtedness  under the indenture 
if we were to incur additional debt or liabilities  our ability to pay our obligations on the notes could be adversely affected 
as of june   we had no senior indebtedness outstanding 
we may be unable to redeem our notes upon a fundamental change 
we may be unable to redeem our notes in the event of a fundamental change defined below 
upon a fundamental change  holders of the notes may require us to redeem all or a portion of the notes 
if a fundamental change were to occur  we may not have enough funds to pay the redemption price for all tendered notes 
any future credit agreements or other agreements relating to our indebtedness may contain similar provisions  or expressly prohibit the repurchase of the notes upon a fundamental change or may provide that a fundamental change constitutes an event of default under that agreement 
if a fundamental change occurs at a time when we are prohibited from purchasing or redeeming notes  we could seek the consent of our lenders to redeem the notes or could attempt to refinance this debt 
if we do not obtain a consent  we could not purchase or redeem the notes 
our failure to redeem tendered notes would constitute an event of default under the indenture 
in such circumstances  or if a fundamental change would constitute an event of default under our senior indebtedness  the subordination provisions of the indenture would restrict payments to the holders of notes 
a fundamental change is any transaction or event whether by means of an exchange offer  liquidation  tender offer  consolidation  merger  combination  reclassification  recapitalization or otherwise in connection with which all or substantially all of our common stock is exchanged for  converted into  acquired for or constitutes solely the right to receive  consideration which is not all or substantially all common stock that o is listed on  or immediately after the transaction or event will be listed on  a us national securities exchange  or o is approved  or immediately after the transaction or event will be approved  for quotation on the nasdaq national market or any similar us system of automated dissemination of quotations of securities prices 
the term fundamental change is limited to certain specified transactions and may not include other events that might adversely affect our financial condition or the market value of the notes or our common stock 
our obligation to offer to redeem the notes upon a fundamental change would not necessarily afford holders of the notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction  reorganization  merger or similar transaction involving us 
a public market for our notes may fail to develop or be sustained 
we cannot assure you that any market for the notes will develop or  if one does develop  that it will be maintained 
if an active market for the notes fails to develop or be sustained  the trading price of the notes could be materially adversely affected 
events with respect to our share capital could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the open market  or the availability of such shares for sale  could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
an adverse effect on the price of our common stock may adversely affect the trading price of the notes 
we had million shares of common stock outstanding as of june  the following securities that may be exercised for  or are convertible into  shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding as of june  o options 
stock options to purchase million shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of approximately per share  of this total  million shares were exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of per share as of such date 
o convertible subordinated notes 
notes which will convert to million shares of our common stock at a conversion price of as of such date 
the shares of our common stock that may be issued under the options and upon conversion of the convertible subordinated notes are currently registered with the sec 
the shares of common stock that may be issued upon conversion of the convertible subordinated notes are eligible for sale without any volume limitations pursuant to rule k under the securities act 
the issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect rights of common stockholders or discourage a takeover 
under our certificate of incorporation  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
in may  our board of directors authorized shares of series b preferred stock in connection with its adoption of a stockholder rights plan  under which we issued rights to purchase series b preferred stock to holders of the common stock 
upon certain triggering events  such rights become exercisable to purchase common stock or  in the discretion of our board of directors  series b preferred stock at a price substantially discounted from the then current market price of the common stock 
our stockholder rights plan could generally discourage a merger or tender offer involving our securities that is not approved by our board of directors by increasing the cost of effecting any such transaction and  accordingly  could have an adverse impact on stockholders who might want to vote in favor of such merger or participate in such tender offer 
while we have no present intention to authorize any additional series of preferred stock  such issuance  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
the preferred stock may have other rights  including economic rights senior to the common stock  and  as a result  the issuance thereof could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the common stock 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness 
as a result of the initial offering of the notes  our long term debt is million 
this indebtedness has affected us by o significantly increasing our interest expense and related debt service costs  and o making it more difficult to obtain additional financing 
we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy the annual debt service payments that will be required under the notes 
this may require us to use a portion of the proceeds of the notes to pay interest or borrow additional funds or sell additional equity to meet our debt service obligations 
if we are unable to satisfy our debt service requirements  substantial liquidity problems could result  which would negatively impact our future prospects 
the market for unrated debt is subject to disruptions  which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the notes 
our notes have not been rated 
as a result  holders of the notes have the risks associated with an investment in unrated debt 
historically  the market for unrated debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of such securities and greatly reduced liquidity for the holders of such securities 
if the notes are traded  they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price  depending on  among other things  prevailing interest rates  the markets for similar securities  general economic conditions and our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
the liquidity of  and trading markets for  the notes also may be adversely affected by general declines in the market for unrated debt 
such declines may adversely affect the liquidity of  and trading markets for  the notes  independent of our financial performance or prospects 
in addition  certain regulatory restrictions prohibit certain types of financial institutions from investing in unrated debt  which may further suppress demand for such securities 
we cannot assure you that the market for the notes will not be subject to similar disruptions 
any such disruptions may have an adverse effect on the holders of the notes 
ratio of earnings to fixed charges the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was negative for periods before june  because we incurred net losses in the periods prior to that time 
the dollar amounts of the deficiency of earnings available to cover fixed charges for the year ended june  and the ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the years ended june    and are disclosed below dollars in thousands year ended june  ratio of earnings to fixed charges n a deficiency of earnings available to cover fixed charges  n a c n a n a n a earnings consist of pre tax income loss plus fixed charges less capitalized interest and preferred stock dividends 
fixed charges consist of interest expense  including amortization of debt issuance costs and that portion of rental expense we believe to be representative of interest 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our exposure to market risk of financial instruments contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from those described 
our holdings of financial instruments are comprised of equity and debt securities and time deposits as of june  all such instruments are classified as securities available for sale 
we do not invest in portfolio equity securities or commodities or use financial derivatives for trading purposes  however we have formed a zero cost protective collar arrangement specific to shares of nps common stock we received under a merger termination agreement discussed below 
our debt security portfolio represents funds held temporarily pending use in our business and operations 
we manage these funds accordingly 
we seek reasonable assuredness of the safety of principal and market liquidity by investing in rated fixed income securities while at the same time seeking to achieve a favorable rate of return 
our market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates 
our holdings are also exposed to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers 
we typically invest the majority of our investments in the shorter end of the maturity spectrum  and at june  all of our holdings were in instruments maturing in four years or less 
the table below presents the principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio as of june  in thousands 
total fair value fixed rate       average interest rate variable rate average interest rate as of june   we had million of convertible subordinated notes outstanding that bear interest at an annual rate of and are due july  the fair value of the notes was approximately million at june  the fair value of fixed interest rate convertible notes is affected by changes in interest rates and by changes in the price of our common stock 
in august  we entered into a zero cost protective collar arrangement the collar to reduce our exposure associated with million shares of nps common stock we received as part of a merger termination agreement with nps 
the terms of the collar are structured so that our investment in nps common stock  when combined with the value of the collar  should secure ultimate cash proceeds in the range of to of the negotiated fair value per share of representing a discount off the closing price of nps common stock on the day before the collar was executed 
the collar is considered a derivative instrument and as such  we carry the collar at fair value as an asset or liability on the balance sheet and changes in fair value are recorded as a charge or credit to earnings in the period of the change 
see note to the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements merger termination agreement 
the value of the collar is subject to market conditions that cause variability associated with its intrinsic and time value 
the fair value of the collar at june  was a receivable of million
