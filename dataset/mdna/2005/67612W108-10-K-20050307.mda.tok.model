the property and casualty reinsurance and insurance industries use the combined ratio as a measure of underwriting profitability 
the gaap combined ratio is the sum of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as a percentage of net premiums earned plus underwriting expenses  which include acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses  as a percentage of net premiums earned 
the combined ratio reflects only underwriting results  and does not include income from investments 
underwriting profitability is subject to significant fluctuations due to competition  catastrophic events  economic and social conditions  foreign currency fluctuations and other factors 
our combined ratio  which includes the losses from four hurricanes as discussed below  was for the year ended december   an increase of percentage points from the combined ratio for the year ended december  this continued underwriting profitability is a direct result of our underwriting actions  including improvements in pricing as well as terms and conditions  global diversification and our opportunistic expansion into better performing lines of business 
we operate our business through four divisions  the americas  euroasia  london market  and us insurance 
the americas division is our largest division and writes casualty  surety and property treaty reinsurance  and facultative casualty reinsurance in the united states and canada  and primarily treaty and facultative property reinsurance in central and south america 
the americas division is comprised of three units  the united states  canada  and latin america  with two offices in new york city  and offices located in stamford  mexico city  miami  santiago and toronto 
the euroasia division operates out of four offices  with principal offices in paris and singapore 
the euroasia business consists of international reinsurance business that is geographically dispersed  mainly throughout the european union  followed by japan  eastern europe  the pacific rim  and the middle east 
the euroasia division has been successful in taking advantage of the rate increases throughout its international scope of operations and in creating new market opportunities by leveraging its long term ceding company and broker relationships 
the london market division is comprised of our lloyd s of london business  in which we participate through our ownership of newline  which in turn owns and manages syndicate  and our london branch office 
our lloyd s membership provides strong brand recognition  extensive broker and direct distribution channels and worldwide licensing  including the ability to write primary business on an excess and surplus lines basis in the united states 
the london market division in general  and newline in particular  has experienced a resurgence of opportunities from domestic and international business 
the london market division writes insurance and reinsurance business worldwide  principally through brokers 
the us insurance division is comprised of hudson  hudson specialty and clearwater 
the us insurance division writes specialty program insurance business  physicians medical malpractice and hospital professional liability business 
the us insurance division operates out of napa  chicago and new york 
revenues we derive our revenues from two principal sources premiums from insurance placed and reinsurance assumed  net of premiums ceded net premiums written  and income from investments 
net premiums written are earned net premiums earned as they are credited to revenue over the terms of the underlying contracts or certificates in force 
the relationship between net premiums written and net premiums earned will  therefore  vary depending generally on the volume and inception dates of the business assumed and ceded and the mix of such business between proportional and excess of loss reinsurance 
consistent with our significant accounting policies  we utilize estimates in establishing premiums written  the corresponding acquisition expenses and unearned premium reserves for our reinsurance business 
these estimates are required to reflect differences in the timing of the receipt of accounts from the ceding company and the actual due dates of the accounts at the close of each accounting period 
the following table displays  by division  the estimates included in the years ended december   and financial statements related to gross premiums written  acquisition costs  accounts receivable and unearned premium reserves in millions change for the year ended as of december  december  division gross premiums written americas euroasia london market total acquisition costs americas euroasia london market total reinsurance balances receivable americas euroasia london market total unearned premium reserve americas euroasia london market total premium estimates  the corresponding acquisition costs and unearned premium reserves are established on a contract level for any significant accounts due but not rendered by the ceding company at the end of each accounting period 
the estimated ultimate premium for the contract  actual accounts rendered by the ceding company  and our own experience on the contract are considered in establishing the estimate at the end of each accounting period 
subsequent adjustments  based on actual results  are recorded in the period in which they become known 
the estimated accounts receivable balances are considered fully collectable 
the estimates primarily represent the most current two underwriting years of accounts for which all corresponding reported accounts have been settled within contract terms 
these estimates are considered critical accounting estimates because changes in these estimates can materially affect net income 
expenses our reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses reflect estimates  which are considered critical accounting estimates  of ultimate claim liability 
we perform quarterly reviews of the adequacy of these estimates of ultimate claim liability taking into consideration current and historical claim information  industry information  pricing and loss trends and relevant qualitative information 
the effect of such quarterly reviews impacts incurred losses for the current period 
our methodology for evaluating reserve adequacy involves processes that may involve assessment of individual contracts  groups of like contracts  classes of business and business units 
the complexities of our operations require analysis on both quantitative and qualitative bases 
in addition  the allocation of changes in reserve estimates between underwriting year and accident year require allocations  both qualitative and quantitative 
all of these processes  methods and practices appropriately balance actuarial science  business experience  and management judgment in a manner intended to assure the accuracy and consistency of our reserving practice 
estimates of reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are contingent on many events occurring in the future 
the eventual outcome of these events may be different from the assumptions underlying our reserve estimates 
in the event the business environment and loss trends diverge from selected trends  we may have to adjust our reserves accordingly 
management believes that the recorded estimate represents the best estimate of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses based on the information available as of december  the estimate is reviewed on a quarterly basis and the ultimate liability may be more or less than the amounts provided  for which any adjustments will be reflected in the periods in which they become known 
included in the estimate of ultimate losses and loss expense liabilities is our exposure to asbestos and environmental claims  which are considered to have a long reporting tail 
our reserve for gross unpaid losses and loss expenses for asbestos claims as of december  was million 
our provision for gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for environmental claims as of december  was million 
net of reinsurance and indemnifications  unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for asbestos and environmental claims were million and million  respectively  as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements

acquisition costs consist principally of commissions and brokerage expenses incurred on business written under reinsurance contracts or certificates and insurance policies 
these costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
commission adjustments with ceding companies are accrued based on the underwriting profitability of the business produced 
deferred acquisition costs are limited to their estimated realizable value  which considers anticipated losses and loss adjustment expenses and estimated remaining costs of servicing the contracts or certificates  all based on our historical experience 
the methods of making such estimates and establishing the deferred costs are continually reviewed by the company  and any adjustments are made in the accounting period in which the adjustment arose 
we believe the estimate of these deferred acquisition costs is a critical accounting estimate  because changes in these estimates can materially affect net income 
other underwriting expenses consist of cost of operations associated with our underwriting activities 
these expenses include compensation  rent  and all other general expenses allocated to our underwriting activity and exclude any investment or claims related expenses

the duration of our investment portfolio exceeds the duration of our liabilities 
we believe this difference is mitigated by the significant amount of cash and cash equivalents maintained  our substantial cash provided by operations and our overall capital position

financial strength ratings represent the opinions of the rating agencies of the financial strength of a company and its capacity to meet the obligations of insurance policies and reinsurance contracts 
the rating agencies consider many factors in determining the financial strength rating of an insurance or reinsurance company  including the relative level of statutory surplus necessary to support the business operations of the company 
these ratings are used by insurers and reinsurance and insurance intermediaries as an important means of assessing the financial strength and quality of reinsurers 
in addition  the rating of a company purchasing reinsurance may be adversely affected by an unfavorable rating of its reinsurer 
a reduction in our financial strength ratings could limit or prevent us from writing new reinsurance or insurance policies 
our financial strength ratings as of december  were am best a excellent  standard poor s a strong and moody s a good financial security 
these ratings are based upon factors relevant to policyholders  agents and intermediaries and are not directed toward the protection of investors 
such ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold securities

in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas r  share based payment 
this statement is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
the statement requires entities to recognize stock compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
sfas r is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  in addition  sfas r requires that excess tax benefits related to stock compensation expense be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid in cash flow from operations 
we are evaluating the two methods of adoption allowed by sfas r the modified prospective transition method and the modified retrospective transition method  and the related financial statement impact

 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp 
the american jobs creation act of ajca introduces a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer repatriation provision  provided certain criteria are met 
the primary criteria to be met is that the repatriated funds must be reinvested in the united states and we are evaluating whether we can meet that criteria given our current us and foreign capital structure

market sensitive instruments the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we believe that we are principally exposed to four types of market risk related to our investment operations 
these risks are interest rate risk  credit risk  equity price risk and foreign currency risk 
all market sensitive instruments discussed in this section relate to our investment assets that are classified as available for sale 
as of december   our billion investment portfolio includes billion of fixed income securities that are subject primarily to interest rate risk and credit risk 
interest rate risk the table below displays the potential impact of market value fluctuations on our fixed income securities portfolio as of december  and december   based on parallel basis point shifts in interest rates up and down in basis point increments 
this analysis was performed on each security individually 
as of december  as of december  fair value of fair value of fixed hypothetical fixed hypothetical income hypothetical income hypothetical percent change in interest rates portfolio change change portfolio change change dollars in millions basis point rise basis point rise base scenario basis point decline basis point decline the preceding table indicates an asymmetric market value response to equivalent basis point shifts  up and down  in interest rates 
this partly reflects exposure to fixed income securities containing a put feature 
in total these securities represent approximately and of the fair market value of the total fixed income portfolio as of december  and december   respectively 
the asymmetric market value response reflects our ability to put these bonds back to the issuer for early maturity in a rising interest rate environment thereby limiting market value loss but to hold these bonds to their much longer full maturity dates in a falling interest rate environment thereby maximizing the full benefit of higher market values in that environment 
as of december   we had gross unrealized appreciation on our entire investment portfolio of million  which is offset by gross unrealized depreciation of million 
disclosure about limitations of interest rate sensitivity analysis computations of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including the maintenance of the existing level and composition of fixed income security assets  and should not be relied on as indicative of future results 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis used in the computation of the fair value of fixed rate instruments 
actual values may differ from those projections presented should market conditions vary from assumptions used in the calculation of the fair value of individual securities  including non parallel shifts in the term structure of interest rates and a change in individual issuer credit spreads 
credit risk we have exposure to credit risk  primarily as a holder of fixed income securities 
we control this exposure by emphasizing investment grade credit quality in the fixed income securities we purchase 
as of december  and  and  respectively  of the aggregate of our fixed income securities  short term investments  cash and cash equivalents portfolio consisted of securities rated investment grade  with and  respectively  rated below investment grade 
we believe that this concentration in investment grade securities reduces our exposure to credit risk on these fixed income investments to an acceptable level 
equity price risk as an economic hedge against a decline in the equity markets  the company entered into total return swap transactions on standard poor s depository receipts spdrs and the financial select spdr fund xlf and  as described below  purchased long standard poor s and xlf index call options on of the securities underlying the swap transactions 
the aggregate notional amount of the swap transactions is million 
the swap transactions terminate during the fourth quarter of as of december   the company has provided million of us treasury bills as collateral for the swap transactions 
the swap transactions are recorded at fair value  based on the remainder of the notional amount less the fair value of the underlying securities 
changes in the fair value of the swap transactions are recorded as realized gains or losses in the consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   the net change in the fair value of the swap transactions resulted in a net realized loss of million 
in the third quarter of the company sold short spdrs and xlf as an economic hedge against a decline in its equity portfolio 
in order to reduce the margin maintenance requirements for these short positions  the company replaced the short positions with the total return swaps described above 
the margin maintenance requirement related to the total return swaps was million as of december  as a component of the swap transactions  the company continues to own standard poor s and xlf index call options at a cost of million  with a strike price of approximately of the notional amount of the swap transactions 
a call option gives the purchaser the right  but not the obligation  to purchase an underlying security at a specific price or prices at or for a certain time 
the call options limit the maximum potential loss on the swap transactions to million of the notional amount of the swap transactions 
the call options are recorded at fair value in other invested assets in the consolidated balance sheet  and changes in the fair value are recorded as a realized gain or loss in the consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   the net change in the fair value of call options resulted in a net realized gain of million 
in addition  as of december   the company had sold short million of borrowed securities  for which it recorded a liability of million 
the net realized loss was million for the year ended december  as of december   the company provided cash and fixed income securities of million as collateral for the borrowed securities 
the company s net investment income for the year ended december  reflects million related to interest expense associated with the borrowed securities 
in connection with the short sales described above  the company purchased a standard poor s index call option at a cost of million with a strike price of of the price at which the borrowed securities were sold short 
the call option is recorded at fair value in other invested assets in the consolidated balance sheet and changes in the fair value are recorded as a realized gain or loss in the consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   the net change in the fair market value of the call option resulted in a net realized gain of million 
as of december  and  and  respectively  of our investment and cash portfolio  was in common stocks unaffiliated and affiliated 
marketable equity securities  which represented approximately and as of december  and  respectively  of our investment and cash portfolio  are exposed to equity price risk  defined as the potential for loss in market value owing to a decline in equity prices 
a decline in the price of each of these marketable equity securities would result in a decline of million and million as of december  and  respectively  in the fair market value of the total investment portfolio 
foreign currency risk through investment in securities denominated in foreign currencies  we are exposed to foreign ie  ie currency risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk is the potential for loss in market value owing to a decline in the us dollar value of these investments resulting from a decline in the exchange rate of the foreign currency in which these assets are denominated 
as of december  and  our total exposure to foreign denominated securities in us dollar terms was approximately billion and million  respectively  or and  respectively  of our investment portfolio  including cash and cash equivalents 
the primary foreign currency exposure was in canadian dollar denominated securities  which represented and of our investment portfolio as of december  and  respectively  and the british pound  which represented and  respectively  of our investment portfolio  including cash and cash equivalents 
as of december   the potential impact of a decline in each of the foreign exchange rates on the valuation of investment assets denominated in those respective foreign currencies would result in a total of million decline in the fair value of the total investment portfolio 
investment impairment risk we frequently review our investment portfolio for declines in value  and focus our attention on securities which have a market value of less than of their amortized cost at the time of review 
generally  a change in the market or interest rate environment does not constitute an impairment of an investment but rather a temporary decline 
temporary declines in investments will be recorded as unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income 
if we determine that a decline is other than temporary  the carrying value of the investment will be written down to the fair value and a realized loss will be recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 
our assessments are based on current evaluations of the financial position and future projections of the entity that issued the investment security 
prior assessments can change  depending upon current pertinent information 
in determining possible impairment of debt securities held as investments  we review market and industry shifts  debt payment schedules that report how current and timely the issuer is with interest and principal payments  the issuer s current financial position  the effect of foreign exchange rates and relevant analysis by rating agencies  investment advisors and analysts 
in determining the possible impairment of equity securities  we review market and industry shifts  historical price to earnings ratios  recent financial statements  independent auditor s reports on the issuer s financial statements and any significant recommendations by investment advisors or rating agencies 
additional relevant information is also considered in determining the valuation of an investment 
the following table reflects our investments fair value and gross unrealized depreciation  aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position  as of december  in thousands duration of unrealized loss less than months greater than months total gross gross gross unrealized number of unrealized number of unrealized number of fair value depreciation securities fair value depreciation securities fair value depreciation securities fixed income securities investment grade united states government agencies and authorities states  municipalities and political subdivisions all other corporate total investment grade fixed income securities non investment grade states  municipalities and political subdivisions all other corporate total non investment grade total fixed income common stocks  at fair value total temporarily impaired securities the gross unrealized depreciation of million resulted principally from the change in the value of us and us equities  the credit quality of fixed income securities and the current interest rate environment 
based on the review discussed above  we determined that there were no securities that required an impairment to be recognized in our statement of operations for the year ended december   as we believe the decline in the investment value of certain securities to be temporary 
we have the ability and intent to hold these securities until the fair market value recovers 
disclosure of contractual obligations the following table provides a payment schedule of present and future obligations in thousands payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt principal long term debt interest capital leases operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities losses and loss adjustment expenses total for further detail on our long term debt principal and interest payments  see note of our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
for further detail on our operating lease payments see note of our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
for further detail on our losses and loss adjustment expenses see note of our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses do not have contractual maturity dates 
however  based on historical payment patterns  we have included an estimate of when we expect our losses and loss adjustment expenses to be paid in the table above 
the exact timing of the payment of claims cannot be predicted with certainty 
we maintain a portfolio of investments with varying maturities and a substantial amount of short term investments to provide adequate cash flows for the payment of claims 
the reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses reflected in the table above have not been reduced for reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses which are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as an asset of  million as of december  based on historical patterns  we estimate that we will collect the recoveries as follows million in less than one year  million in to years  million between three and five years and million in more than five years
