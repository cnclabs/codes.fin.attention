we may make additional investments in hotel properties and may incur indebtedness to make such investments or to meet distribution requirements imposed on a reit under the internal revenue code of to the extent that working capital and cash flows from our investments are insufficient to make such distributions 
our board has adopted a policy limiting aggregate indebtedness to of our investment in hotel properties  at cost  after giving effect to our use of proceeds from any indebtedness 
this policy may be amended at any time by the board without shareholder vote 
our consolidated indebtedness was of our investment in hotels  at original cost  at december

table of contents during  we purchased hotels for approximately million related to previously announced acquisitions 
the hotels were purchased from three hotel developers 
these hotels represent a combined  rooms and have an average age of approximately five years 
of the hotels purchased  hotels are managed by mckibbon hotel management  inc  five hotels are managed by hospitality group  inc and two hotels are managed by gateway lodging company  inc we funded these acquisitions primarily through million in net cash proceeds from april and october issuances of our common stock  the issuance of approximately  partnership units valued at approximately million  the assumption of approximately million in secured long term debt  the issuance of approximately million in secured long term debt and approximately million in borrowings under our line of credit 
included in our debt assumption is a mortgage note premium of approximately million to record the debt at its estimated fair value 
this premium is being amortized using the interest method over the remaining lives of the assumed debt as a reduction of interest expense 
during  we invested approximately million to fund capital improvements in our hotels  including replacement of carpets  drapes  furniture and equipment  renovation of common areas and improvements of hotel exteriors 
we expect to fund an aggregate of approximately million throughout for capital improvements  with approximately million representing major refurbishment projects to six hotels 
we intend to fund such improvements out of our cash flows from operations  current cash balances and borrowings under our line of credit 
under our franchise agreements  we are periodically required to make capital improvements in order to maintain our brand standards 
additionally  under certain of our loan covenants  we are generally obligated to fund of total hotel revenues per quarter on a cumulative basis  to a separate room renovation account for replacement of furniture  fixtures and equipment  maintenance  and capital improvements for our hotels 
for  the amounts expended exceeded  in the aggregate  the amounts required under our loan covenants 
if  for any reason  we do not meet the renovation requirements at the individual hotel level  we could be required to fund such shortfalls into cash escrow accounts 
we currently have one lender that could require us to deposit approximately million into an escrow account  but the lender has thus far decided not to trigger the escrow funding based on our future capital improvement plans for the individual hotels 
during  we sold three hotels for approximately million  including approximately million in cash after selling costs of approximately  and an increase to an existing note receivable of  we utilized the net proceeds to pay down existing long term debt

in conjunction with this refinancing  the company incurred a prepayment penalty of approximately  and this prepayment penalty is included as a component of interest expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
during  we completed a million  year secured loan related to our courtyard by marriott in tallahassee  florida 
the loan has a fixed rate of per annum 
during  we experienced significant hurricane damage at one of our hotels located in jacksonville beach  florida 
this hotel was subsequently repaired and became operational in late january the total cost of the hurricane loss is estimated to be approximately million  and we are currently working with our insurance carrier in processing this claim 
based on the total estimated project cost  the estimated net insurance proceeds and the estimated net book value of the assets destroyed  we expect to record a net gain on insurance proceeds upon the conclusion of the processed claim 
this gain will be recorded upon receipt of the net insurance proceeds and closure of the insurance claim 

table of contents in  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a financial institution on a notional amount of million 
the agreement expires in november the agreement effectively fixes the interest rate on the first million of floating rate debt outstanding under our line of credit at a rate of per annum plus the interest rate spread on our line of credit  or at december   thus reducing our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
the notional amount does not represent amounts exchanged by the parties  and thus is not a measure of exposure to us 
the differences to be paid or received by us under the interest rate swap agreement are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
the agreement is with a major financial institution  which is expected to fully perform under the terms of the agreement 
in  we entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement with a financial institution on a notional amount of million 
the agreement expires in november the agreement effectively fixes the interest rate on the second million of floating rate debt outstanding under our line of credit at a rate of per annum plus the interest rate spread on our line of credit  or at december   thus reducing our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
the notional amount does not represent amounts exchanged by the parties  and thus is not a measure of exposure to us 
the differences to be paid or received by us under the interest rate swap agreement are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
the agreement is with a major financial institution  which is expected to fully perform under the terms of the agreement 
reits are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements 
for example  for federal income tax purposes  a reit  and therefore the company  is required to pay distributions of at least of its taxable income to our shareholders 
we intend to pay these distributions from operating cash flows 
during  our partnership distributed an aggregate of approximately million to its limited partners  or 
per unit per quarter including approximately million of distributions to the company to fund distributions to our shareholders of 
per share per quarter 
we expect to make future quarterly distributions to our shareholders 
the amount of our future distributions will be based upon quarterly operating results  economic conditions  capital requirements  the internal revenue code s annual distribution requirements  leverage restrictions imposed by our line of credit and other factors which our board deems relevant 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled debt maturities and property acquisitions  through long term secured and unsecured borrowings  the issuance of additional debt and equity securities of the company or  in connection with acquisitions of hotel properties  the issuance of partnership units 
under our partnership s limited partnership agreement  subject to certain holding period requirements  holders of units in our partnership have the right to require the partnership to redeem their units 
during  approximately  units were tendered for redemption 
under the partnership agreement  we have the option to redeem units tendered for redemption on a one for one basis for shares of common stock or for an equivalent amount of cash 
funds from operations the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  defines funds from operations  or ffo  as net income loss applicable to common shareholders excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate  the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles  real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo does not include the cost of capital improvements or any related capitalized interest 
ffo is presented on a per share basis  including the assumed conversion of all partnership units  and after making adjustments for the effects of dilutive securities 
we use ffo per share as a measure of performance to adjust for certain non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization because historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 

table of contents because real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be less informative 
nareit adopted the definition of ffo in order to promote an industry wide standard measure of reit operating performance 
accordingly  as a member of nareit  equity inns adopted ffo as a measure to evaluate performance and facilitate comparisons between the company and other reits  although our ffo and ffo per share may not be comparable to ffo measures reported by other companies 
the following reconciliation of net income to ffo  applicable to common shareholders  illustrates the difference in these measures of operating performance in thousands for the years ended december  net income loss applicable to common shareholders add subtract gain loss on sale of hotel properties minority interests income depreciation depreciation from discontinued operations funds from operations ffo weighted average number of diluted common shares and partnership units outstanding for  ffo includes a non cash loss on impairment of a hotel held for sale of approximately million and a debt prepayment penalty of approximately  included as a component of interest expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations  in conjunction with the company refinancing million of senior debt at a fixed rate of per annum with million of year senior debt at a fixed rate of per annum

table of contents we also maintain certain contractual agreements with property managers and franchisors that require us to pay fees in conjunction with operating our hotels 
generally  the amounts payable under these agreements are dependent upon the operating results of our hotels 
the following schedule details these fees for the years ended december in thousands management fees franchisor related fees total fees recent accounting pronouncements note of the notes to consolidated financial statements discusses the expected impact of accounting policies recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be adopted 
to the extent the adoption of new accounting standards affects our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  the impacts are discussed in the applicable section s of the management s discussion and analysis and the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management contracts our management agreements with hyatt  which purchased the amerisuites brand in january from the blackstone group  which purchased the brand from prime hospitality corporation in october  are structured to provide the trs lessees minimum net operating income at each of our amerisuites hotels 
in addition  the management agreements specify a net operating income threshold for each of our amerisuites hotels 
as the manager  hyatt s subsidiaries can earn an incentive management fee of of hotel net operating income above the threshold  as defined  to a maximum of of gross hotel revenues 
if the management fee calculation exceeds of gross hotel revenue  hyatt s subsidiaries may earn an additional fee of on any additional net operating income 
if a hotel fails to generate net operating income sufficient to reach the threshold  hyatt s subsidiaries are required to contribute the greater of a predetermined minimum return or the net operating income plus of the shortfall between the threshold amount and the net operating income of the hotel 
we record all shortfall contributions as a reduction of base management fees  which are included as a component of direct hotel expenses in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations  when all contingencies related to such amounts have been resolved 
in may  we updated our current franchise contracts and management agreements with hyatt s subsidiaries for all of our amerisuites hotels 
the minimum net operating income guarantee agreements were not extended beyond their original terms and are set to expire in and under the new agreements  we extended the existing franchise agreements to and the management agreements to  as long as hyatt continues to be in compliance with the minimum net operating income guarantees in the original agreements 
for  and  we recorded approximately million  million and million  respectively  in minimum income guarantees from hyatt as a reduction of our base management fee expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the management contracts for our remaining hotels have terms ranging from one to four years and generally provide for payment of management fees ranging from to of hotel revenues and an incentive fee consisting of a percentage of gross operating profits in excess of budget  as defined by the management agreements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with 
table of contents accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  all estimates are evaluated by our management  including those related to bad debts  carrying value of investments in hotel properties  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
all estimates are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers and other borrowers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level believed adequate by us to absorb estimated probable receivable losses 
our periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is primarily based on past receivable loss experience  known and inherent credit risks  current economic conditions  and other relevant factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates including the amounts and timing of future collections 
if the financial condition of our customers or other borrowers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
investment in hotel properties we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment in a hotel has been impaired such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the book basis of the hotel property  or the hotel is being held for sale 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we classify certain assets as held for sale based on management having the authority and intent of entering into commitments for sale transactions expected to close in the next twelve months 
when the company identifies an asset held for sale  we estimate the net realizable value of such asset 
if the net realizable value of the asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we record an impairment charge for the estimated loss 
we no longer record depreciation expense once we identify an asset as held for sale 
net realizable value is estimated as the amount at which we believe the asset could be bought or sold fair value less costs to sell 
we estimate the fair value by determining prevailing market conditions  appraisals or current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offers  if appropriate 
we record operations for hotels designated as held for sale and hotels which have been sold as part of discontinued operations for all periods presented 
we also allocate to discontinued operations the estimated interest on debt that is to be assumed by the buyer and interest on debt that is required to be repaid as a result of the disposal transaction 
for  we recorded a loss on impairment of a hotel held for sale of approximately million 
for  we recorded losses on impairments of hotels held for sale of approximately million 
these impairments are reflected as a component of discontinued operations for the respective periods in the accompanying statements of operation 

table of contents income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
at year end  we determined  it was more likely than not  that we would not be able to realize our million deferred income tax asset  and we recorded a full valuation allowance for this asset 
our trs lessees continue to accumulate net operating losses primarily due to the lease payments that our trs lessees pay to their respective lessors  in conjunction with our assumption of the operating leases from several of our independent management companies in as a result of these continued losses  we continue to record a valuation allowance for the full amount of our deferred income tax asset 
additionally  we will not record a deferred income tax benefit until it is more likely than not that such benefit will be realized 
other developments acquisitions during  we purchased hotels for approximately million related to previously announced acquisitions 
the hotels were purchased from three hotel developers 
these hotels represent a combined  rooms and have an average age of approximately five years 
of the hotels purchased  hotels are managed by mckibbon hotel management  inc  five hotels are managed by hospitality group  inc and two hotels are managed by gateway lodging company  inc we funded these acquisitions primarily through million in net cash proceeds from april and october issuances of our common stock  the issuance of approximately  partnership units valued at approximately million  the assumption of approximately million in secured long term debt  the issuance of approximately million in secured long term debt and approximately million in borrowings under our line of credit

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to certain financial market risks  the most predominant of which is the fluctuation in interest rates 
at december   our exposure to market risk for a change in interest rates is related to our debt outstanding under the line of credit and certain hotel secured debt 
total debt outstanding under these two debentures totaled approximately million at december  as discussed below  we do maintain two interest rate swap agreements for a combined notional amount of million 
our line of credit bears interest at a variable rate of libor plus to per annum as determined by our quarterly leverage 
at december   our interest rate on our line of credit was libor at december  plus 
our interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for borrowings under our line of credit through the use of interest rate swaps  in order to effectively lock the interest rate on a portion of our variable rate debt 
we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
we also regularly review interest rate exposure on our outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuation 
in  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a financial institution on a notional amount of million 
the agreement expires in november the agreement effectively fixes the interest rate on the first million of floating rate debt outstanding under our line of credit at a rate of per annum plus the interest rate spread on our line of credit  thus reducing our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
the notional amount does not represent amounts exchanged by the parties  and thus is not a measure of exposure to us 
the differences to be paid or received by us under the interest rate swap agreement are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
the agreement is with a major financial institution  which is expected to fully perform under the terms of the agreement

the agreement is with a major financial institution  which is expected to fully perform under the terms of the agreement 
our line of credit matures in june as discussed above  our line of credit bears interest at variable rates  and therefore  cost approximates market value 
at december   the fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of approximately  our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates  primarily as a result of our borrowings under the line of credit 
if interest rates increased by basis points  our interest expense would have increased by approximately  based on balances outstanding during the twelve months ended december
