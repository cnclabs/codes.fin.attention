item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview on february   the company completed the acquisition of of zao comcor tv cctv  a russian company that delivers cable television  high speed data transmission and internet services to its customers in moscow  russia 
cctv is an early stage business that is currently expanding its hybrid fiber coaxial network the hfc network and increasing its customer base 
prior to february  the company had an indirect equity interest in cctv through its equity interest in abc moscow broadband communication ltd 
mbc  which in turn held voting control over cctv 
as an integral component of the acquisition of cctv in february  the company also acquired the of mbc that it did not previously own 
as a result of the company s acquisition of cctv in february  cctv s results of operations are now consolidated into the company s 
accordingly  th e current period information is not comparative with prior period information 
we have incorporated certain cctv historical operating results and information in the discussion of our results of operations to assist in the analysis and evaluation of our results 
in january  the company closed on a million debt and equity financing package with affiliates of columbus nova capital collectively  columbus nova 
as part of the debt and equity financing  we received million  before taking into account transaction costs currently estimated to total million to million  in exchange for  shares of newly authorized series b convertible preferred stock series b preferred stock at a price of per share  and we issued columbus nova five year warrants to acquire  shares of series b preferred stock at per share 
our wholly owned subsidiary  cctv  also received million of proceeds from a million five year term loan term loan with columbus nova 
as a result of this debt and equity financing package  columbus nova acquired approximately a equity interest in the company  or approximately a eq uity interest on a fully diluted basis after considering the conversion of the series b preferred stock and the exercise of the warrants to acquire  additional shares of series b preferred stock 
the net proceeds from the columbus nova equity and debt financing are expected to provide us with the capital that we believe is needed to more aggressively build out our hfc network  expand sales and marketing programs and improve certain aspects of our 
back to table of contents administrative infrastructure 
the transaction also involved the addition of new senior management and new members to our board of directors 
such changes are expected to have pronounced impacts on our future results of operations 
accordingly  we do not believe that our results for the ten month transition period ended december  are necessarily indicative of the results which we expect in although we are expecting further growth in revenues from increased numbers of subscribers for our internet and cable television services  such growth is largely dependent upon our ability to continue to expand our hfc network in moscow and the degree of success in our efforts to attract and retain subscribers for these services 
in addition  competitive pressures in moscow are expected to reduce average monthly tariff rates  particularly for subscribers for internet services 
our cost structure has been increased to acco mmodate planned growth  so  as a result  we do expect to incur higher levels of selling  general and administrative costs and interest expense in in connection with the transaction with columbus nova  in the first quarter of  we also expect to record a non cash charge of an estimated  relating to the beneficial conversion feature of each of the series b preferred stock and the warrants issued to columbus nova 
the charge will reflect the difference between the conversion price and the market price for our common stock of per share on the closing date 
we also expect to expense the in the money value of  of stock options granted to new management and consultants at closing over the three year vesting periods of such options 
such charge will be in addition to any expense we may be required to record to comply with the provision of sfas r  share based payment 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  investments  intangible assets including goodwill  income taxes  financing operations  retirement benefits  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is primarily derived from the sale of cable television and internet services to subscribers 
all revenues are recorded net of vat only when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  services have been delivered  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
customer arrangements for cable television or internet services typically include a connection fee  required equipment purchase or rental  as well as a monthly service fee 
the company considers the various elements of these arrangements to be part of one bundled service offering to its customers 
in accordance with securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin  the company defers connection fees  set top box and modem sales and related costs  and recognizes them ratably over the estimated customer relationship period if the company has demonstrated that the service offering to the customer will be profitable 
in the event that company believes the customer service offering has not yet demonstrated profitability  the loss on the service arrangement with the customer is recognized immediately 
at present  the company has determined that its internet access services are profitable  but its delivery of cable television content has not yet demonstrated profitability 
doubtful accounts the company calculates allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the company to collect amounts due from its customers 
management bases its estimates on historical write off experience  aging of receivable balances and changes in customer payment terms 
prepaid pension expense the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plan in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pension plans  which provides for the delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses that arise from differences between actual results of the plan from the actuarially calculated results based on several factors including employee mortality and turnover  investment return on plan assets and the discount rates used to record the present value of the obligations of the plan 
to the extent that unrecognized gains or losses exceed of the greater of the plan s projected benefit obligation or the market value of its assets  such excess is amortized over the estimated remaining service period of active employees 
however  as a result of the planned termination of substantially all us based employees  such excess unrecognized actuarial losses will instead be recognized over the estimated lives o f all plan participants 
the company considers and adjusts the various assumptions utilized in the calculations such as the discount rate  future compensation growth rate and the long term rate of return on plan assets  as market conditions warrant 

back to table of contents impairment of long lived assets long lived assets such as property  plant  and equipment and acquisition related intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
for assets the company intends to hold for use  if the total of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset 
the company considers a number of factors when estimating expected future undiscounted cash flows  including forecasted revenues  expenses  changes in technology and industry conditions 
the company periodically evaluates the useful lives of its property  plant  and equipment based on changes in technology  current business developments  and other industry conditions 
it is reasonably possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of these factors 
valuation of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company performs an impairment test of goodwill annually  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our business enterprise below its carrying value 
the impairment test requires the company to estimate the fair value of our overall business enterprise 
we believe a discounted cash flow dcf model is the best technique with which to estimate the fair value of our business enterprise 
the company has determined that we have one reporting unit for purposes of testing goodwill and therefore  the dcf model is largely a function of the cash flows of the business enterprise 
deferred tax assets the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
the company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
when the company determines that it may not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to estimated recoverable amounts is charged to income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  a reduction in the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made 
results of operations ten months ended december  vs 
ten months ended december  in january  the company s board of directors approved a change in the company s fiscal year from february to december  effective december  accordingly  the company is reporting its results of operations for the ten month transition period ended december  tp and is presenting this discussion and analysis of those results in comparison to the unaudited results of operations for the ten month period ended december  tp

in addition to cctv s operating progress  the effects of purchase accounting have generally resulted in lower amounts of depreciation and amortization in tp than had been reported by cctv for due to the fact that the carrying value of cctv s assets was reduced based on the allocation of the purchase price to their fair values at the date of acquisition in february the per share results in tp reflect the increase in the company s weighted average outstanding shares  primarily as the result of the shares of common stock issued in february and september in connection with the acquisitions of cctv and mbc 
to assist in the analysis of the company s results of operations  those portions of the company s results for tp which relate to cctv s results for the year ended december  will be compared to the results cctv reported for the year ended december  cctv s losses for the two month period prior to the acquisition have been added back in the company s consolidated results in tp to the extent that the company did not have an equity interest in such results prior to the acquisition of cctv

an increase in deferred costs relating to subscriber equipment and installation costs contributed to an increase of  in prepaid expenses and other assets 
the company used  of cash in investing activities 
net proceeds from the company s investment trading activities were more than offset by capital expenditures  primarily relating to the expansion of cctv s hfc network which increased from  homes passed as of december  to  homes passed at december   with an additional approximately  homes which were substantially constructed but not yet connected and put into service 

back to table of contents financing activities provided  as a result of the million of proceeds from the columbus nova bridge loan  less principal payments on a mortgage loan and the company s subordinated debentures and amounts expended to redeem a portion of the company s series a preferred stock and the payment of preferred dividends 
on january   the company and cctv collectively received million of a million equity and debt financing package from columbus nova  before costs and fees currently estimated at to million associated with the equity portion of the transaction are considered 
in addition  million was used to repay a bridge loan extended by columbus nova in connection with the overall financing package  and fees of the debt portion of the transaction totaling approximately  were also paid 
the bridge loan allowed cctv to make and commit to capital expenditures for the expansion of its hfc network for the delivery of television and internet access services in moscow which it expects will result in an increase in the number of its homes passed network in the second quarter of the company expects that the remaining proceeds from the financing  including an additional million that may be received pursuant to the million term loan within the next two years if the requirements described below are met  will be used to further expand cctv s existing hfc network of  homes  to pay for the expected net increase in charges from comcor as a result of anticipated expansion of the hfc network and cost increases and reductions in the terms of new agreements with comcor  to improve the company s administrative and operating infrastructure  including the cost of additional executives and consultants who have been retained by the company in connection with the columbus nova financing  and to meet debt service and the dividend requirements on the company s series a preferred stock 
there can be no assurances that the proceeds received and which may be received from columbus nova will be sufficient to adequately build out cctv s hfc network to enable cctv to attract a sufficient number of subscribers who elect to take up cctv s cable based services  or if the build out of the homes passed network does progress  that cctv can attract a sufficient number of subscriber services to be taken to generate the revenues that will be needed to achieve profitability 
however  the company does not expect to require additional funds outside of the columbus nova financing for the next two years  although there can also be no assurances that cctv will meet the  homes passed requirement to enable it to draw the final million of the term loan 
if cctv is not able to obtain the final million from the term loan  it may require additional financing to enable it to continue to expand its network and service s  and there can be no assurances with respect to the company s ability to attract additional financing or of the terms of any such financing it may obtain in such circumstances 
the million drawdown on the term loan bears interest at the annual rate of which will increase our costs from historical levels 
the company has the option to pay the interest quarterly  or to roll interest into the principal of the term loan at which time  such capitalized interest will also accrue interest expense 
if the company elects to pay the interest currently as it comes due  such use of cash may restrict its ability to fully implement the business expansion plans for cctv in moscow 
if the interest is capitalized into the principal of the term loan  the compound growth in the expense and the liability could hamper the company s ability to attract additional future financing or to justify meaningful value for the company s equity securities 
the term loan also involved pledges of substantially all of the company s and cctv s assets  including but not limited to fixed assets  securities  the shares of all significant subsidiaries and all future revenue 
the company and cctv also committed to compensate columbus nova for any currency transaction losses and expenses that may be incurred in connection with any breach of the provision of the agreements 
as of december   the company does not expect to have to make any contributions to fund the obligations of its defined benefit pension plan 
at december   the recorded value of the prepaid expense relating to this plan was  which represents an increase of  over the prior year s amount 
under the actuarial calculations  the plan is overfunded by  a decrease of  from the prior year 
in accordance with sfas  the company has not recognized net actuarial losses totaling  such losses have arisen primarily from reductions in the actuarially assumed discount rate to value the plan s obligations 
the following table presents the company s contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations these obligations exclude the effects of the increased obligation relating to the million draw down on the term loan which occurred in january 
back to table of contents recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
and amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
the company expects to adopt sfas r on july  sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either for a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company has not yet determined the method it plans to adopt 
as permitted by sfas  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on the company s results of operations  although it will have no impact on the company s overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had the company adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements stock option plans 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of rec ognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement is not expected to have a material impact on our reported net operating cash flows or our net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has a contingent liability with respect to a  letter of credit used by its bank to secure performance bonds issued in connection with an unresolved state income tax matter 
the company believes that its accruals are sufficient to meet any obligations that may arise from this matter 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and from factors that impact equity and operational investments in russia 
foreign investment risk since the company s wholly owned subsidiary  cctv  operates in russia  the company is subject to the economic and political risks associated with operating in russia 
in addition  fluctuations in the value of the russian ruble may affect the reporting of the company s results of operation and financial condition in terms of us dollars 
the company s current pricing strategies involve monthly tariffs that are closely tied to the value of the us dollar but still paid in russian rubles 
this could result in fluctuations in revenues that are not met equally or proportionally with changes in the company s expenses 
furthermore  beginning in  certain of the company s expenses are euro based  and the company bears the risk of fluctuations in the us dollar euro exchange rate 
the company has not entered into any derivative instruments to hedge its russian ruble or euro currency risks 
n bsp  operating cctv also involves the risk of cctv s ability to increase its revenues through the addition of subscribers for its cable television  high speed data transmission and internet services 
the subscriber growth is largely dependent upon cctv s ability to build out its hfc network 
back to table of contents from the mfon which it leases from comcor  which is largely dependent upon it receiving a sufficient amount of capital to pay for the equipment and construction costs 
interest rate risk at december   the company had a mortgage loan payable with a remaining principal balance of  which bore interest at the rate of  which was based on the libor rate in effect at the origination of the loan 
in the future  the interest rate will fluctuate with any changes in the libor rate 
the company estimates that a change in the interest rate at the next interest re set in august would increase the interest expense for by approximately  factors affecting future financial results this transition report on form k  the company s annual report to shareholders  any form q or form k or any other written or oral statements made by or on the company s behalf may include forward looking statements that reflect the company s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
the forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below  that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or anticipated results 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
following the acquisition of of cctv in february  substantially all of the value of the company s net assets and results of operations are dependant on cctv s financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  the following discussion relates primarily to the risks and uncertainties that affect cctv 
the following factors could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from anticipated results the company may experience liquidity difficulties 
although the company and cctv received a total of million in january  prior to the effects of transaction costs and the repayment of the bridge loan from columbus nova  such cash resources may prove inadequate as cctv accelerates the build out of its hfc network throughout moscow and other capital expenditure commitments are made 
in addition  the agreements with comcor which were ratified by the company s board in march resulted in a payment to comcor of more than million and will cause cctv to make larger monthly cash payments for services from comcor than had previously been made 
also  the addition of new management has increased the company s cost structure  as will planned improvements in certain administrative and operational areas and expansion of sales and marketing costs 
no assurance can be given as to the adequacy of the proceeds from the columbus nova financing or to the benefits to be derive d there from 
as a result  although not expected in  the company and cctv could be exposed to future liquidity difficulties 
cctv s revenues are not yet sufficient to meet its cash operating expenses  and the company requires continued access to a portion of the funds received from columbus nova to meet its operating expense and other cash obligations 
if the company or cctv is exposed to liquidity difficulties there is no assurance that additional financing could be obtained on favorable terms 
risks related to columbus nova s ownership interest in the company columbus nova has an equity interest in the company of approximately and it has a warrant to purchase additional shares of stock which could increase its equity ownership in the company to approximately 
columbus nova has selected five of the directors on our ten person board of directors  it has the right to select an additional director and it appointed the new management which has joined the company 
in addition  we are indebted to columbus nova in an amount of million and may become indebted for an additional million 
this indebtedness is likely to grow if quarterly interest charges are not paid and are compounded into the principal balance of the borrowing 
therefore  any future transactions between us and columbus nova may not be at arm s length 
also  the new management and the new board of directors may manage and direct the management of our business in a manner different than the manner in which the former senior management and board of directors managed and directed the company s business 
these factors could lead to conflicts of interest between columbus nova and our other stockholders and other actions that could adversely affect the interests of such other stockholders 
risks related to the operation of cctv because cctv has had a limited operating history  its future performance is difficult to predict 
cctv s business strategy has been implemented recently and although it has experienced relatively strong growth in revenues  to date cctv s revenue growth has not been adequate to have it reach profitability or achieve positive cash flow from operations 
the growth of cctv depends on the appeal of the services it provides to russian consumers 
cctv s ability to establish itself in the russian market will be affected by several factors  including the ability of cctv to continue and expand its growth rates in an increasingly competitive market 
there is no assurance that cctv will be successful in effectively implementing its business strategy and  because cctv has had a limited operating history  investors have limited basis upon which to form an evaluation of the prospects for performance and an investment in the company s common stock 

back to table of contents the company cannot assure that a market for cctv s future services will develop or that cctv can satisfy subscriber expectations 
cctv currently offers its subscribers a number of value added services  such as high speed internet access and cable television 
it may also develop plans to offer ip based telephony and web hosting services 
cctv may not be successful in creating or competing in a market for these value added services 
in particular  the company cannot be assured that cctv can enhance its current services  develop new services that meet changing subscriber needs  generate significant demand for its new services through successful advertising and marketing initiatives  satisfy subscriber expectations with respect to value added services  provide its new services in a profitable manner  and continue to offer value added services in the event of adverse changes in economic conditions 
we are dependant on outside parties to increase our homes passed hfc network 
in moscow  in order for us to build out our hfc network in the various regions  we require authorization from the prefects of each of the regions 
currently  we rely on comcor to petition and obtain such authorizations 
we are not certain that we would be able to obtain such authorizations without comcor or its key officials 
our operating plans are very much dependant on our ability to build out our hfc network in administrative regions of moscow for which we have not had approvals obtained on our behalf 
if we did not receive the support of comcor or its key officials in this process  we have no basis to believe that we would be able to readily obtain the required authorizations to continue our build out activities 
our future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairments or other charges 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result  we are required to test both acquired goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach  rather than amortizing them over time 
we have chosen to perform our annual impairment review of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
we are also required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  including a significant sustained decline in an entity s market value  legal factor s  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business  or other factors 
if our market value is less than our book value for an extended period of time  we could be required to record an impairment charge 
we may also be required to record an earnings charge or incur unanticipated expenses if  due to a change in strategy or other reason  we determine that the value of other assets has been impaired or we terminate a contractual commitment 
the amount of any such annual or interim impairment or other charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken 
cctv operates in a highly competitive industry 
there is substantial competition for the delivery of cable television and internet access services in moscow 
we expect competition to intensify as a result of the development of new technologies  products and services  and as market penetration increases 
other television service providers serve each of the markets in which cctv competes 
this competition may put downward pressure on subscriber and revenue growth and profit margins 
television service providers compete principally on service area  price  service quality  and features 
cctv s ability to compete successfully will depend on its ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors  including service quality  coverage area  new services  service features and enhancements  changes in consumer preferences  demographic trends  economic conditions and competitors pricing strategie s 
similarly  there is significant competition for the delivery of internet access services 
although we believe that cctv is the largest provider of cable based internet access in moscow  there is significant competition from adsl carriers and individual home lan providers 
the trend of lower monthly tariffs for product offerings is expected to continue 
significant changes in technology or demand for television service could materially adversely affect us 
the television service industry is experiencing significant technological change 
this change includes evolving industry standards  ongoing improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology  shorter development cycles for new products  enhancements and changes in end user needs and preferences  development of data and high bandwidth network capabilities  migration to next generation services  and expanded availability and functionality of other competing technologies 
the pace and extent of customer demand may not continue to increase which could result in shortfalls from anticipated subscriber growth rates 
as a result  the future prospects of the industry and of cctv and the success of its competitive services remains 
back to table of contents uncertain 
also  alternative technologies may develop that may provide alternative service superior to that available from cctv 
such developments could have a material adverse affect on cctv 
cctv must face operational risks associated with a growing company 
cctv s revenues have shown strong growth in each of the past two years  and we are hopeful that opportunities will allow us to continue on this strong growth pattern 
however  to continue strong revenue growth we need to continue to build out our hfc network and attract new subscribers 
many cable companies face challenges in gaining access to individual residences or apartment buildings to sell and market their services 
cctv could face similar obstacles 
in addition  planned increases in our growth rates will require the hiring and training of qualified installers and other technical workers 
although we believe the available labor pool in moscow is conducive to such growth  there can be no assurance of our ability to attract and train a sufficient number of workers to meet projected order flow deman ds 
in addition  growing companies face challenges associated with managing and administering to the needs of higher volumes of transactions 
this requires hiring and training customer support and other administrative and operational support staff and managers to ensure procedures and controls are properly implemented to serve our growing customer base and to ensure that all elements of the operations and administration function adequately 
although we believe that we can meet these needs through additional hiring and through the advancement of the careers of present employees  there can be no assurance of our ability to successfully meet these growing challenges 
the actual amount of funds necessary to implement cctv s strategy and business plan may materially exceed current estimates  which could have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition and results of operations 
although we have recently attracted a debt and equity investment facility which has resulted in our receiving million of cash  prior to transactions costs  and may result in our receiving an additional million  the actual amount of funds necessary to implement cctv s strategy and business plan may materially exceed our current estimates in the event of various factors including departures from our current business plan  shortfalls in projected revenue growth  unforeseen construction delays  cost overruns  unanticipated expenses  regulatory developments  engineering design changes  and technological and other risks 
if actual costs do materially exceed current estim ates for these or other reasons or cctv is unable to control or reduce costs  this could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to operating in russia economic instability in russia could adversely affect cctv s business 
since the end of communism in the early s  russia s economy has been undergoing a rapid transformation from a one party state with a centrally planned economy to a pluralist democracy with a market oriented economy 
this transformation has been marked by periods of significant instability 
in particular  the russian government s decision to temporarily stop supporting the ruble in august caused the currency to collapse 
at the same time  the russian government defaulted on much of its short term domestic debt and imposed a day moratorium on foreign debt payments by russian companies 
the russian government subsequently entered into protracted negotiations with its creditors to reschedule the terms of its domestic and foreign debt 
thus far  these negotiations have not yielded terms favorable to western creditors 
it is poss ible that russia may default on its domestic or foreign debt in the future or take other actions that could adversely affect its financial stability 
operating in such an economic environment makes it more difficult for cctv to obtain and maintain credit facilities  access international capital markets and obtain other financing to satisfy cctv s future capital needs 
the august financial crisis marked the beginning of an economic downturn that affected the entire russian economy and resulted in russia s equity market being the worst performing equity market in the world for although the russian economy has experienced a positive trade balance in recent years  future downturns in the russian economy are possible and could diminish demand for cctv s services and cctv s ability to retain existing subscribers and collect payments from them 
future downturns in the russian economy could also prevent cctv from executing its growth strategy  which could cause its business to suffer 
although there have been improvements in the economic situation in the russian federation in recent years  the country continues to display some characteristics of an emerging market 
these characteristics include  but are not limited to  the existence of a currency that is not freely convertible in most countries outside of the russian federation  restrictive currency controls  and relatively high inflation 
the prospects for future economic stability are largely dependent upon the effectiveness of economic measures undertaken by the governments  together with legal  regulatory  and political developments 
fluctuations in the global economy may adversely affect russia s economy and cctv s business 
russia s economy is vulnerable to market downturns and economic slowdowns elsewhere in the world 
as has happened in the past  financial problems or an increase in the perceived risks associated with investing in emerging economies could dampen foreign investment in russia and adversely affect the russian economy 
in addition  a steep decline in the world price of oil could slow or disrupt the russian economy because russia 
back to table of contents produces and exports large amounts of oil 
these developments could severely limit cctv s access to capital and could adversely affect the purchasing power of cctv s customers and  consequently  cctv s business 
sustained periods of high inflation may adversely affect cctv s business 
russia has experienced high levels of inflation since the early s 
inflation increased dramatically following the august financial crisis 
the government s history of printing money to pay back wages  pensions and some of its debt has prompted concerns of hyperinflation 
due to high inflation and other economic and political pressures  the ruble lost significant value against the us dollar and other foreign currencies in and cctv s operating results could suffer if it is unable to sufficiently increase its prices to offset increased inflation 
arbitrary or selective government actions in russia may disrupt cctv s business 
governmental authorities have a high degree of discretion in russia and at times may act selectively or arbitrarily  without hearing or prior notice  and sometimes in a manner that is contrary to law or influenced by political or commercial considerations 
cctv s operations are licensed by the russian government and the licenses under which it operates have expired 
unlawful  selective or arbitrary governmental actions have reportedly included denial or withdrawal of licenses  sudden and unexpected tax audits  criminal prosecutions and civil actions 
cctv may be subjected to government pressure through selective implementation of regulations and legislation that is either politically motivated or triggered by competitors 
in this environment  cctv s competitors may receive preferential treatment from the government  potentially giving them a competitive advantage  or cctv s operations may be hindered  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
social instability in russia could lead to increased support for centralized authority and a rise in nationalism  which could restrict the manner in which cctv operates its business 
social instability in russia  coupled with difficult economic conditions  could lead to increased support for centralized authority and a rise in nationalism 
these sentiments could lead to restrictions on foreign ownership of russian companies in the data communications industry or large scale nationalization or expropriation of foreign owned assets or businesses 
although the company does not anticipate the nationalization or expropriation of cctv s assets  the concept of property rights is not well developed in russian law and there is not a great deal of experience in enforcing legislation enacted to protect private property against nationalization and expropriation 
as a result  the company may not be able to obtain proper redress in the cour ts  and cctv may not receive adequate compensation if in the future the russian government decides to nationalize or expropriate some or all of its assets 
if this occurs  the company s business could be harmed
