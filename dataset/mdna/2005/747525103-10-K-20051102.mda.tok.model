table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview recent highlights revenues for fiscal were billion  with net income of billion 
the following recent developments occurred with respect to key elements of our business or our industry cdma based g subscribers to wireless operators services grew to at least million worldwide through september  including at least million xev do subscribers and at least million wcdma subscribers  according to data from a large portion of the wireless operators around the world 
cdma based handset shipments by manufacturers to wireless operators during the period july through june totaled approximately million units at an average selling price of approximately based on reports in fiscal by our licensees 
the ratio of wcdma reported royalties to total reported royalties grew from approximately reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal to approximately reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal through october  six manufacturers in china have been added  at our standard worldwide wcdma royalty rates  to the more than companies that have licensed our wcdma patent portfolio 
during fiscal  we shipped approximately million mobile station modem msm integrated circuits for cdma based phones and data modules nearly all of which were g  including cdma x  xev do and wcdma compared to approximately million msm integrated circuits in the prior fiscal year 
during fiscal  seven new customers selected our wcdma umts msm integrated circuits for their wcdma phone products bringing the total number of wcdma customers to  of which have been publicly announced 
as of september  wireless operators were offering brew services in countries  including customers acquired related to the elata acquisition 
as reported in june  brew publishers and developers have earned more than million to date from the sale of wireless applications and services developed for the brew service 
through september  three operators  including alltel  have entered into agreements to license our uione user interface technology 
during fiscal  we continued to invest in new emerging technologies through strategic acquisitions and research and development 
we completed four acquisitions this year  including iridigm  trigenix  spike and elata  and announced our intent to acquire flarion 
each of these acquisitions provides us complementary or expanded offerings to our existing technologies 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  mediaflo conducted the first live  over the air demonstration of flo technology 
the demonstration featured over the air delivery and viewing of multiple channels of high quality qvga wireless multimedia content  both streaming video and multicast packet data  on a wireless handset 
our business and operating segments we design  manufacture and market digital wireless telecommunications products and services based on our cdma technology and other technologies 
we derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products  from license fees and royalties for use of our intellectual property  from services and related hardware sales and from software development and licensing and related services 
operating expenses primarily consist of cost of equipment and services  research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses 

table of contents we conduct business primarily through four reportable segments 
these segments are qualcomm cdma technologies  or qct  qualcomm technology licensing  or qtl  qualcomm wireless internet  or qwi  and qualcomm strategic initiatives  or qsi 
qct is a leading developer and supplier of integrated circuits and system software for wireless voice and data communications  multimedia functions and global positioning 
qct s integrated circuit products and software are used in wireless phones  data cards and infrastructure equipment 
the wireless phone integrated circuits include the mobile station modem msm  radio frequency rf and power management pm devices 
the wireless phone integrated circuits and software perform voice and data communication  multimedia and global positioning functions  radio conversion between radio and baseband signals  and power management 
the infrastructure equipment integrated circuits provide the core baseband cdma modem functionality in the operator s equipment 
qct software products are the operating systems that control the phone and the functionality imbedded in our integrated circuit products 
qct revenues comprised  and of total consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
qtl grants licenses to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio  which includes certain patent rights essential to and or useful in the manufacture and sale of cdma products  including  without limitation  products implementing cdmaone  cdma  wcdma and or the cdma tdd standards and their derivatives 
qtl receives license fees as well as ongoing royalties based on worldwide sales by licensees of products incorporating our intellectual property 
qtl revenues comprised  and of total consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
qwi  which includes qualcomm wireless business solutions qwbs  qualcomm internet services qis and qualcomm government technologies qgov  generates revenue primarily through mobile communication products and services  software and software development aimed at support and delivery of wireless applications 
qwbs provides satellite and terrestrial based two way data messaging  position reporting and wireless application services to transportation companies  private fleets  construction equipment fleets and other enterprise companies 
qis provides brew binary runtime environment for wireless products and services  including the uione customizable user interface product and the deliveryone content distribution system  for the development and over the air deployment of data services on wireless devices 
qis also provides qchat and qpoint products and services 
qchat enables virtually instantaneous push to chat functionality on cdma based wireless devices while qpoint enables operators to offer e and location based applications and services 
the qgov division provides development  hardware and analytical expertise to united states government agencies involving wireless communications technologies 
qwi revenues comprised  and of total consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
qsi makes strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of cdma products and services 
our strategy is to invest in cdma operators  licensed device manufacturers and start up companies that we believe open new markets for cdma technology  support the design and introduction of new cdma based products or possess unique capabilities or technology 
effective as of the beginning of fiscal  we present the operating results of our wireless multimedia operator  mediaflo usa  inc mediaflo usa  in the qsi segment 
our mediaflo usa subsidiary expects to offer a nationwide mediacast network based on our flo forward link only technology and mediaflo media distribution system mds  initially targeting top domestic markets  with the eventual capability for broader nationwide coverage 
this network is expected to be utilized as a shared resource for wireless operators and their customers within the united states starting in latter flo is a multicast technology specifically designed for markets where dedicated spectrum is available and where regulations permit high power transmission  thereby reducing the number of towers and related infrastructure required to provide market coverage 
mediaflo usa plans to use nationwide mhz spectrum for which we hold licenses and will be procuring and distributing content which we will make available wholesale to our wireless operator customers 
distribution  marketing  billing and customer relationships are expected to remain services provided by our wireless operator customers 
we are evaluating a number of corporate structuring options  including distributing our ownership interest in mediaflo usa to our stockholders in a spin off transaction 
nonreportable segments include the qualcomm wireless systems division  which sells products that operate on the globalstar low earth orbit satellite communications system and provides related services  the qualcomm mems technologies division  comprised of the iridigm business  a display technology company that we acquired in the first quarter of fiscal  and other product initiatives 

table of contents looking forward we expect continued growth in demand for cdma and wcdma products and services in markets around the world operators on the cdma technology path are deploying xev do and are preparing to deploy ev do revision a 
many gsm operators are migrating their networks to wcdma and are preparing to deploy hsdpa high speed downlink packet access 
the deployment of these g networks enables higher voice capacity and data rates  thereby supporting more minutes of use and data intensive applications like multimedia 
as of october  wcdma networks have launched  as reported by the global mobile suppliers association  an international organization of wcdma and gsm global system for mobile communications suppliers 
we expect that the wcdma market will continue to expand as operators transition their subscribers to wcdma devices on these wcdma networks 
we expect that volume increases and growing competition among wcdma phone manufacturers and wcdma integrated circuit suppliers will help decrease wcdma phone prices significantly and drive growth of wcdma phone sales worldwide 
we expect that growing demand for advanced g phones and devices will continue to drive the need for increased multimedia msm functionality 
to meet this market need  we intend to continue to invest significant resources toward multimedia functionality 
we expect growing demand for low end phones to continue and have invested resources for single chip solutions which combine the baseband  radio frequency and power management chips into one package 
we believe lower component counts and further integration will drive costs down and enable faster time to market to meet the increasing demand for low end phones 
while we are moving aggressively to address the low end market more effectively with cdma based products  we still face significant competition from gsm based products in this market 
we also expect growing demand for high end  multimedia phones with added functionality and capability at a high price point 
the expiration of royalty sharing obligations under two agreements  one in fiscal and the other in fiscal  will contribute to an increase in our royalty revenues in fiscal and beyond 
we will continue our development efforts with respect to our brew applications development platform  our new mediaflo multimedia distribution system mds and flo technology for low cost delivery of multimedia content to multiple subscribers simultaneously and our imod display technology 
we are dependent upon the commercial deployment of g wireless communications equipment  products and services based on our cdma technology to increase our revenues and market share 
we continue to face significant competition from non cdma technologies  as well as competition from companies offering other cdma based products 
recent reports suggest that inflation could have adverse effects on the global economy and the capital markets 
you should also refer to the risk factors included in this annual report for further discussion of these and other risks related to our business 
revenue concentrations revenues from customers in south korea  japan and the united states comprised  and  respectively  of total consolidated revenues in fiscal as compared to  and  respectively  in fiscal  and  and  respectively  in fiscal we distinguish revenue from external customers by geographic areas based on customer location 
revenues from customers in japan increased as a percentage of total revenues  from in fiscal to in fiscal and in fiscal  due primarily to increased royalties reported by licensees in japan resulting from the growth of cdma and wcdma in japan as well as their success in exporting products worldwide 
combined revenues from customers in south korea and the united states decreased as a percentage of total revenues  from in fiscal to in fiscal and in fiscal  due primarily to increases in revenues from manufacturers of cdma and wdcma products in other regions such as china  japan and western europe 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation of intangible assets and investments  income taxes  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products  from royalties and license fees for our intellectual property  from messaging and other services and related hardware sales and from software development and licensing and related services 
the timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors  including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations 
determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable  but it is possible that actual results may differ from our estimates 
we license rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio  which includes certain patent rights essential to and or useful in the manufacture and sale of cdma products  including  without limitation  products implementing cdmaone  cdma  wcdma and or the cdma tdd standards and their derivatives 
licensees typically pay a license fee in one or more installments and ongoing royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property 
license fees are recognized over the estimated period of future benefit to the average licensee  typically five to seven years 
we earn royalties on such licensed cdma products sold worldwide by our licensees at the time that the licensees sales occur 
our licensees  however  do not report and pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter  and  in some instances  although royalties are reported quarterly  payment is on a semi annual basis 
during the periods preceding the fourth quarter of fiscal  we estimated and recorded the royalty revenues earned for sales by certain licensees the estimated licensees in the quarter in which such sales occurred  but only when reasonable estimates of such amounts could be made 
not all royalties earned were recorded based on estimates 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that  due to escalating and changing business trends  we no longer had the ability to reliably estimate royalty revenues from the estimated licensees 
these escalating and changing trends included the commercial launches and global expansion of wcdma networks  changes in market share among licensees due to increased global competition  and increased variability in the integrated circuit and finished product inventories of licensees 
starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began recognizing royalty revenues solely based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter 
the change in the timing of recognizing royalty revenue was made prospectively and had the initial one time effect of reducing royalty revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal valuation of intangible assets and investments 
our business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets  and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future 
as of september   our goodwill and intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were million and million  respectively 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
we assess potential impairments to intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our acquired businesses  market conditions and other factors 
although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process  the estimates and assumptions we use are consistent with our internal planning 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill and intangible assets 
furthermore  we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

table of contents we hold minority investments in publicly traded companies whose share prices may be highly volatile 
these investments  which are recorded at fair value with increases or decreases generally recorded through stockholders equity as other comprehensive income or loss  totaled billion at september  we record impairment charges when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary 
the determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future 
when assessing a publicly traded investment for an other than temporary decline in value  we consider such factors as  among other things  how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost  how long the market value of the investment has been less than its original cost  the performance of the investee s stock price in relation to the stock price of its competitors within the industry and the market in general and analyst recommendations 
we also review the financial statements of the investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial difficulties 
in the event our judgments change as to other than temporary declines in value  we may record an impairment loss which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
during fiscal  and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  in other than temporary losses on our minority investments in publicly traded companies 
we hold minority strategic investments in private companies whose values are difficult to determine 
these investments totaled million at september  we record impairment charges when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary 
the determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future 
when assessing investments in private companies for an other than temporary decline in value  we consider such factors as  among other things  the share price from the investee s latest financing round  the performance of the investee in relation to its own operating targets and its business plan  the investee s revenue and cost trends  the liquidity and cash position  including its cash burn rate and market acceptance of the investee s products and services 
from time to time  we may consider third party evaluations  valuation reports or advice from investment banks 
we also consider new products services that the investee may have forthcoming  any significant news that has been released specific to the investee or the investee s competitors and or industry and the outlook of the overall industry in which the investee operates 
in the event our judgments change as to other than temporary declines in value  we may record an impairment loss which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
during fiscal and  we recorded million and million  respectively  in other than temporary losses on our investments in private companies 
such losses were not significant in fiscal income taxes 
our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
while we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns  we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
as part of our assessment of potential adjustments to our tax returns  we increase our current tax liability to the extent an adjustment would result in a cash tax payment or decrease our deferred tax assets to the extent an adjustment would not result in a cash tax payment 
we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision  the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 
although we believe that the estimates and assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable  adjustments could be materially different from those which are reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
as of september   gross deferred tax assets were million 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to increase our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets which could result in an increase in our effective tax rate and an adverse impact on operating results 

table of contents as of september   we had gross deferred tax assets of million related to capital loss carry forwards 
we can only use capital losses to offset capital gains 
based upon our assessments of projected future capital gains and losses and related tax planning strategies  we expect that our future capital gains will not be sufficient to utilize all the capital losses that we have incurred through fiscal therefore  we have provided a valuation allowance in the amount of million for the portion of capital losses we do not expect to utilize 
adjustments to our valuation allowance based on changes to our forecast of capital losses and capital gains are reflected in the period the change is made 
we consider the operating earnings of certain non united states subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states 
no provision has been made for united states federal and state  or foreign taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries  the cumulative amount of which is approximately billion as of september  should we repatriate foreign earnings  we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings of foreign subsidiaries is made 
on october   the american jobs creation act of the jobs creation act was signed into law 
the jobs creation act created a temporary incentive for corporations in the united states to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we repatriated approximately billion of foreign earnings qualifying under the jobs creation act and recorded a related expense of approximately million for federal and state income tax liabilities 
the distribution does not change our intention to indefinitely reinvest earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries outside the united states 
litigation 
we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
although there can be no assurance that unfavorable outcomes in any of these matters would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results  liquidity or financial position  we believe the claims are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the actions 
we estimate the range of liability related to pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated 
we record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable 
where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range  we record the minimum estimated liability related to the claim 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liability associated with our legal proceedings based on our belief that a liability  while possible  is not probable 
further  any possible range of loss cannot be estimated at this time 
revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations 
acquisitions in october  we completed the acquisitions of iridigm display corporation iridigm  a display technology company  for a total of approximately million in cash and the exchange of stock options with an estimated aggregate fair value of approximately million  and trigenix limited trigenix  a mobile user interface company for approximately million in cash 
the convergence of consumer electronics products  including cameras  mp players  camcorders  gps receivers and game consoles into wireless devices is driving the increased adoption of g cdma 
iridigm s display technology  known as imod  enables advanced  high resolution multimedia capabilities on all tiers of mobile devices  while providing substantial performance  power consumption and cost benefits  as compared to other alternative display technologies 
our acquisition of iridigm is intended to accelerate the time to market for iridigm s display technology  which fits our overall strategy of rapidly increasing the capability of wireless devices while driving down cost  size and power consumption 
in addition to having a better display  operators and device manufacturers need a secure and modular approach for customizing their phone user interfaces so they can brand and differentiate their handsets 
our acquisition of trigenix complements our brew offering by adding trigenix s user interface development tools  enhancing the capabilities of our brew uione user interface and accelerating the time to market for new user interface features  such as multi perspective window display technology 
in august  we completed the acquisition of elata  ltd 
elata  a developer of mobile content delivery and device management software systems  for a total of approximately million in cash 
our acquisition of elata will enable us to offer a unified mobile content delivery system to operators who desire an enhanced framework for managing  delivering and marketing rich wireless content 
the elata single service delivery 
table of contents framework  which leverages open standards interfaces to ensure interoperability and retain backward compatibility  is platform agnostic and will allow operators to consolidate the delivery of all of their content services without having to change their device portfolio 
this acquisition will also expand our presence in europe by enabling us to offer european operators a content delivery system that can be easily integrated with their existing core network and business systems 
the elata single service delivery framework has become part of our family of brew product offerings and is being marketed under the brand name deliveryone 
in august  we announced our intention to acquire flarion technologies  inc flarion  a developer of ofdma technology 
upon completion of the acquisition  which is anticipated in the first half of fiscal  pending regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions  we estimate that we will pay approximately million in consideration  consisting of approximately million in shares of qualcomm stock  million in cash  and the exchange of flarion s existing vested options and warrants with a fair value of approximately million 
upon achievement of certain agreed upon milestones on or prior to the eighth anniversary of the close of this transaction  we may issue additional aggregate consideration of million  consisting of approximately million payable in cash to flarion stockholders and million in shares of qualcomm stock  which will be issued to flarion option holders and warrant holders upon or following the exercise of such options and warrants 
our acquisition of flarion is intended to broaden our ability to effectively support operators who may prefer an ofdma or a hybrid ofdm cdma wcdma network alternative for differentiating their services 
the addition of flarion s intellectual property and engineering resources will also supplement the resources that we have already dedicated over the years towards the development of ofdm ofdma technologies 
strategic investments in our qsi segment our qsi segment makes strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of cdma products and services 
qsi segment assets totaled million at september   compared to million at september  our mediaflo usa subsidiary  a wireless multimedia operator  is expected to begin commercial operations in latter we also enter into strategic relationships with cdma wireless operators and developers of innovative technologies or products for the wireless communications industry 
due to financial and competitive challenges facing wireless operators  we cannot assure you that our investments in or loans to these operators will generate financial returns or that they will result in increased adoption or continued use of cdma technologies 
cdma wireless operators to whom we have provided funding have limited operating histories  are faced with significant capital requirements and are highly leveraged and or have limited financial resources 
if these cdma wireless operators are not successful  we may have to write down our investments in or loans to these operators 
our qsi segment maintains strategic investments in marketable equity securities classified as available for sale 
we strategically invest in companies in the high technology industry and typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our exposure to market risks in these investments 
the fair values of these strategic investments are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to significant market price volatility 
our strategic investments in specific companies and industry segments may vary over time  and changes in concentrations may affect price volatility 
downward fluctuations and market trends could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  the realizable value of these securities and derivative instruments is subject to market and other conditions 
qsi also makes strategic investments in privately held companies  including early stage companies and venture funds 
these investments are comprised of equity investments  recorded at cost or under the equity method  and warrants that are recorded at fair value or at cost 
the recorded values of these investments may be written down due to changes in the companies conditions or prospects 
these strategic investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products the investees are developing may never materialize 
as a result  we could lose all or a portion of our investments in these companies  which could negatively affect our financial position and operating results 
most of these strategic investments will not become liquid until more than one year from the date of investment  if at all 
to the extent such investments become liquid and meet strategic and price objectives  we may sell the investments and recognize the realized gain loss in investment income expense 
we regularly monitor and evaluate the realizable value of our investments in both marketable and private securities 
if events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the value of these assets has occurred and is other than temporary  we will record a charge to investment income expense 
in some cases  we make strategic investments that require us to consolidate or record our equity in the losses of early stage companies 
the consolidation of these losses can adversely affect our financial results until we exit from or reduce our exposure to the investments 

table of contents key developments in our strategic investments during fiscal included our ongoing investment in our mediaflo usa subsidiary  a slow down in the rate of strategic investment  including our investment in inquam  and realized gains on certain strategic investments 
investment in inquam limited 
since october  we and another investor the other investor have provided equity and debt funding to inquam limited inquam 
inquam owns  develops and manages wireless cdma based communications systems  either directly or indirectly  primarily in romania and portugal 
we recorded million  million and million in equity in losses of inquam during fiscal  and  respectively 
at september   our equity and debt investments in inquam totaled million  net of equity in losses  and we had no remaining funding commitment under our bridge loan agreement 
during fiscal  inquam secured new long term financing the new facilities 
we and the other investor each guaranteed of a portion of the amounts owed under certain of the new facilities  up to a combined maximum of million 
amounts outstanding under the new facilities subject to the guarantee totaled million as of september  the guarantee expires and the new facilities mature on december  in october  we and the other investor agreed to restructure inquam 
upon close of the restructuring  which is expected to occur in the first half of fiscal  the portugal companies will be spun off through the exchange of portions of our and the other investor s debt investments for direct equity interests in the portugal companies 
inquam  which will continue to own the romania companies  will repurchase certain minority equity interests 
immediately after the restructuring  we will hold an approximate equity interest in inquam and a equity interest in the portugal companies  which is expected to be reduced over time as the other investor makes the further investments in the portugal companies contemplated by the restructuring agreements 
in addition  we and the other investor will have a put call option arrangement 
under this arrangement  the other investor will have the right to buy our equity and debt investments in inquam  subject to certain conditions  by exercising its call option  which will expire no later than may  the minimum purchase price will be approximately million 
in the event that the other investor s call option expires  or in certain other circumstances prior to that date  we will have the right to sell our equity and debt investments in inquam to the other investor at a minimum sales price of million 
such right will expire after six months 
we do not anticipate providing any further funding to inquam or to the portugal companies 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
total revenues for fiscal were billion  compared to billion for fiscal revenues from lg electronics  samsung and motorola  customers of our qct  qtl and qwi segments  comprised an aggregate of  and of total consolidated revenues  respectively  in fiscal  compared to  and of total consolidated revenues  respectively  in fiscal revenues from sales of equipment and services for fiscal were billion  compared to billion for fiscal revenues from sales of integrated circuits increased million  resulting primarily from an increase of million related to higher unit shipments of msm and accompanying rf integrated circuits  partially offset by a decrease of million related to the effects of reductions in average sales prices and changes in product mix 
revenues from the sale of satellite and terrestrial based two way data messaging systems and related messaging services increased million and revenues from the sale of satellite portable phones that operate on the globalstar low earth orbit satellite communications system increased million 
revenues from licensing and royalty fees for fiscal were billion  compared to billion for fiscal during fiscal  the qtl segment recorded royalty revenues solely based on royalties reported by licensees during the year  as compared to the method used during the first three quarters of fiscal of recording royalty revenues from certain licensees based on estimates of royalty revenues earned by those licensees during the quarter 
the increase in royalty revenue year to year resulted primarily from a million increase in royalties reported to us by our external licensees and the effect of changing the timing of recognizing royalty revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal royalty revenues recorded in fiscal excluded million of royalties that were reported by external licensees in the first quarter of fiscal  but estimated and recorded as revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal royalties reported to us by external licensees in fiscal were billion  as compared to billion in fiscal the increase in royalties reported to us by external licensees was primarily due to an increase in sales of cdma products by licensees  resulting from higher worldwide demand for cdma products at higher average selling prices due primarily to the growth in sales of high end wcdma products and shifts in the geographic distribution of sales of cdma products 

table of contents cost of equipment and services 
cost of equipment and services revenues for fiscal was billion  compared to billion for fiscal cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and services revenues was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the margin percentage decline in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in qct margin percentage 
increases in product support costs and the reserves for excess and obsolete inventory contributed and  respectively  to the total decrease in qct margin percentage 
cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and services revenues may fluctuate in future quarters depending on the mix of products sold and services provided  competitive pricing  new product introduction costs and other factors 
research and development expenses 
for fiscal  research and development expenses were billion or of revenues  compared to million or of revenues for fiscal the dollar and percentage increases in research and development expenses primarily resulted from a million increase in costs related to integrated circuit products and other initiatives to support lower cost phones  multimedia applications  high speed wireless internet access and multimode  multiband  multinetwork products and technologies  including cdma x xev do  wcdma  hsdpa  gsm gprs edge and ofdma  and the development of our flo technology  mediaflo mds and imod display products using mems technology 
we expect that research and development costs will increase in fiscal as we continue our active support of cdma based technologies  products and network operations and other product initiatives 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
for fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses were million or of revenues  compared to million or of revenues for fiscal the dollar increase was primarily due to a million increase in professional fees  primarily patent administration and outside consultants  a million increase in employee related expenses  and a million decrease in other income 
net investment income 
net investment income was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the change was primarily comprised as follows in millions year ended september  september  change interest and dividend income qsi corporate and other segments interest expense net realized gains on investments qsi corporate other than temporary losses on investments gains on derivative instruments equity in losses of investees the increase in interest and dividend income on cash and marketable securities held by corporate and other segments was a result of higher average cash and marketable securities balances and higher interest rates earned on interest bearing securities 
net realized gains on corporate investments increased primarily as a result of an increase in the positive performance of marketable equity securities as a percentage of total corporate investments in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the increase in net realized gains on strategic investments in qsi resulted primarily from a million gain on our minority investment in a wireless publisher and a million gain on the sale of our investment in nextwave telecom inc gains and losses on derivative instruments in both fiscal and related primarily to changes in the fair values of put options sold in connection with our stock repurchase program 
equity in losses of investees decreased primarily due to a decrease in losses incurred by inquam  of which our share was million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal income tax expense 
income tax expense from continuing operations was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the annual effective tax rate for continuing operations was approximately for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the annual effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal was lower than the annual effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal primarily due to an increase in foreign earnings taxed at less than the united states federal tax rate 

table of contents the annual effective tax rate for fiscal was lower than the united states federal statutory rate primarily due to benefits of approximately related to foreign earnings taxed at less than the united states federal rate  related to an increase in tax benefits resulting from our increased ability to use our capital loss carryforwards and related to research and development tax credits  partially offset by state taxes of approximately

in accordance with the new rule  the accounting provisions of fas r will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal we tentatively expect to adopt the provisions of fas r using a modified prospective application 
fas r  which provides certain changes to the method for valuing share based compensation among other changes  will apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date and are subsequently modified or cancelled 
compensation expense for outstanding awards for which the requisite service had not been rendered as of the effective date will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under fas at september   unamortized compensation expense related to outstanding unvested options  as determined in accordance with fas  that we expect to record during fiscal was approximately million before income taxes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate market risk 
we invest most of our cash in a number of diversified investment and non investment grade fixed and floating rate securities  consisting of cash equivalents and marketable securities 
changes in the general level of united states interest rates can affect the principal values and yields of fixed income investments 
if interest rates in the general economy were to rise rapidly in a short period of time  our fixed income investments could lose value 
if the general economy were to weaken significantly  the credit profile of issuers of securities held in our investment portfolios could deteriorate  and our investments could lose value 
we may implement investment strategies of different types with varying duration and risk return trade offs that do not perform well 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for our interest bearing securities  the table presents principal cash flows  weighted average yield at cost and contractual maturity dates 
additionally  we have assumed that these securities are similar enough within the specified categories to aggregate these securities for presentation purposes 

table of contents interest rate sensitivity principal amount by expected maturity average interest rates dollars in millions no single fair thereafter maturity total value fixed interest bearing securities cash and cash equivalents interest rate held to maturity securities interest rate available for sale securities investment grade interest rate non investment grade interest rate floating interest bearing securities cash and cash equivalents interest rate held to maturity securities interest rate available for sale securities investment grade interest rate non investment grade interest rate equity price market risk 
we invest in a number of diversified marketable securities and mutual fund shares subject to equity price risk 
the recorded values of marketable equity securities increased to billion at september  from million at september  the recorded value of equity mutual fund shares decreased to million at september  from million at september  our diversified investments in specific companies and industry segments may vary over time  and changes in the concentrations of these investments may affect the price volatility of our investments 
a decrease in the market price of our marketable equity securities and equity mutual fund shares at september  would cause a corresponding decrease in the carrying amounts of these securities  or million 
our strategic investments in other entities consist substantially of investments in private early stage companies accounted for under the equity and cost methods 
accordingly  we believe that our exposure to market risk from these investments is not material 
additionally  we do not anticipate any near term changes in the nature of our market risk exposures or in management s objectives and strategies with respect to managing such exposures 
the recorded values of these strategic investments totaled million at september   as compared to million at september  we hold warrants to acquire equity interests in certain strategic investees that are subject to equity price risk 
substantially all of these warrants are recorded at fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the recorded values of warrants held at september  totaled million  as compared to million at september  in connection with our stock repurchase program  we sell put options that may require us to repurchase shares of our common stock at fixed prices 
these written put options subject us to equity price risk 
at september   two put options were outstanding  which expire on december  and march   that may require us to repurchase  shares of our common stock upon exercise for million net of the option premiums received 
the put option liabilities  with a fair value of million at september   were included in other current liabilities 
if the fair value of our common stock at september  decreased by  the put options would expire unexercised resulting in million in investment income 
if the fair value of our common stock at september  decreased by  the amount required to physically settle the put options would exceed the fair value of the shares repurchased by approximately million  net of the million in premiums received 
additional information regarding our strategic investments is provided in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and operating results in this annual report 

table of contents foreign exchange market risk 
we manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments  consisting primarily of foreign currency forward and option contracts 
such derivative financial instruments are viewed as hedging or risk management tools and are not used for speculative or trading purposes 
at september   we had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 
at september   the recorded values of our foreign currency option contracts that hedge the foreign currency risk on royalties earned from certain international licensees on their sales of cdma and wcdma products were million 
if our forecasted royalty revenues were to decline by and foreign exchange rates were to change unfavorably by in each of our hedged foreign currencies  we would incur a loss of approximately million resulting from a decrease in fair value of the portion of our hedges that would be rendered ineffective 
see note to the consolidated financial statements the company and its significant accounting policies for a description of our foreign currency accounting policies 
financial instruments held by consolidated subsidiaries and equity method investees which are not denominated in the functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may affect reported earnings 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we may hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions 
as a result  we could experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash flows  as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments 
while we may hedge certain transactions with non united states customers  declines in currency values in certain regions may  if not reversed  adversely affect future product sales because our products may become more expensive to purchase in the countries of the affected currencies 
our analysis methods used to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future risks
