item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we are a global provider of integrated network solutions that include access and transport equipment  technical services and content and operation management systems for broadband networks 
the company operates in three business segments c cor access and transport  c cor network services  and c cor solutions 
our c cor access and transport segment is responsible for the development  management  production  and support of our network infrastructure products  including our amplitude modulation headend hub optical platform and line of optical nodes  a full offering of radio frequency amplifiers  digital video systems  and high quality  high capacity transport platforms for multiservice  packet based networks 
our c cor network services segment provides technical services for engineering  design  and deployment of advanced applications over broadband networks  including outsourced operational services  network design and engineering  network integration  outside plant and construction services  and consulting to a variety of customers 
our c cor solutions segment is responsible for development  integration  management  implementation  support  and sale of content management systems  including software and hardware  for delivery of video on demand and digital advertising as well as application oriented software for subscriber activation and retention  network and service assurance  and workforce management 
net sales for fiscal year were million  a decrease of from million in fiscal year  reflecting lower revenues from the sales of products and technical services  which were partially offset by higher revenues from sales of digital advertising insertion and operational support solutions 
our largest customers during the fiscal year were time warner cable and adelphia communications adelphia  accounting for and  respectively  of net sales 
our revenues from digital advertising and operational support systems increased during the fiscal year  primarily as a result of our acquisition of the business of ncube corporation ncube during the year 
with the addition of the ncube business  we expect that our c cor solutions segment will contribute a higher proportion of net sales in the future 
multiple revenue recognition models are used in this segment based upon specific contractual terms including completed contract  percentage of completion  and software revenue accounting pursuant to aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended see note 
as a result of these different models  reported net sales could fluctuate significantly in this segment and deferred revenue balances could grow causing a delay in recognition of revenue 
our operating expenses grew from of revenue in fiscal year to of revenue in fiscal year the increased operating expenses were primarily related to increased personnel costs as a result of integrating our acquisitions  increased promotional costs  increased accounting and consulting fees  and increased amortization of intangibles and other charges associated with acquisitions 
the increased accounting and consulting fees were primarily related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of since may  we have completed five acquisitions 
these acquisitions further our strategic plan to provide products  services and software solutions to support the anticipated migration of today s hybrid fiber coax networks to networks based on all digital  internet protocol ip packet technology 
our acquisitions have significantly increased our goodwill and other intangible assets 
at june   we had recorded million of goodwill and million of other intangible assets 
while goodwill is no longer amortized  we are required to assess whether goodwill is impaired at least annually and more frequently if circumstances warrant 
any impairment of goodwill could result in a substantial charge to earnings  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial position in the period in which such impairment is recorded 
for additional information regarding goodwill and other intangibles  see note we are subject to various risks associated with our business operations 
for additional information concerning risks  refer to risks related to our business  in part  item of this form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the applicable period 
management bases its estimates  assumptions  and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
the critical accounting policies requiring estimates  assumptions  and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are revenue recognition allowances for doubtful accounts valuation of inventories valuation of goodwill  other intangible assets  and long lived assets restructuring costs warranty liabilities accounting for foreign currency translation and transactions accounting for income taxes different assumptions and judgments would change estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  which  in turn  could change the results from those reported 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales and sales type leases is recognized based upon delivery terms 
revenue is recognized when the equipment has been shipped to the customer if delivery terms are origin based fob shipping point and ex works 
when delivery terms are destination based fob destination  delivery duty unpaid ddu and delivery duty paid ddp  revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the equipment 
when payments are received upon product delivery and the agreement with the customer contains a customer acceptance clause  revenue is deferred until customer acceptance is obtained 
service revenues  consisting of system design  field services  and other consulting engagements  are generally recognized as services are rendered in accordance with the terms of contracts 
we also enter into multiple element contracts that entail delivery of both products and services 
revenue from these contracts is accounted for under the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  for certain contracts we have recorded revenue by reference to the costs incurred to date and the estimated costs remaining to fulfill the contracts 
for other contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method  we record revenue and costs based on the units of delivery method 
this method recognizes as revenue the contract price of units of the product delivered during each period and the costs allocable to the delivered units as the cost of earned revenue 
provisions for losses on service contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes apparent 
for contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method  we typically perform the services prior to billing the customer which gives rise to unbilled receivables 
in these circumstances  billings usually occur shortly after we perform a specified amount of the work  as outlined in the contract 
unbilled receivables are expected to be billed and collected generally within three to six months 
content and operations management systems revenues consist of equipment and application oriented software to support the sale of video on demand systems  digital advertising insertion systems  and operational support systems 
for our software licensing arrangements involving multiple elements  revenue is allocated to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair values of the elements 
our vsoe of fair value is determined based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
if vsoe of fair value does not exist for all elements in a multiple element arrangement  revenue is deferred until all undelivered elements without vsoe are delivered at which time we apply the residual method 
under the residual method  if vsoe exists for the undelivered elements  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and recognized ratably  and the remaining portion of the arrangement is recognized as revenue upon delivery  which generally occurs on completion of implementation of the system 
license revenue allocated to software products  in certain circumstances  is recognized upon the delivery of the software products 
for certain of our software license arrangements where professional services are being provided that are deemed to be essential to the functionality or are for significant production  modification  or customization of the software product  both the software product revenue and the professional service revenue are recognized on the completed contract method  as the company does not have the ability to reasonably estimate contract costs at the inception of the contracts 
under the completed contract method  revenue is recognized when the contract is complete  and all direct costs and related revenues are deferred until that time 
beginning in fiscal year  we recognize software license and associated professional services revenue for one of our software license products mobile workforce management using the percentage of completion method of accounting as we believe that our estimates of costs to complete and extent of progress toward completion of such contracts are reliable 
software maintenance and support service fees are generally billed and collected in advance of the associated maintenance contract term and are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably under the straight line method over the term of the contract 
the entire amount of an estimated loss on a contract is accrued at the time a loss on a contract is projected 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we establish a general allowance for doubtful accounts based on percentages applied to certain aged receivable categories 
these percentages are determined by a variety of factors  including current economic trends  contractual terms and conditions  and historical payment experience 
in addition  we establish allowances for specifically identified doubtful accounts when a loss is deemed to be both probable and estimable 
in the event that we are not able to predict changes in the financial condition of our customers  resulting in an unexpected problem with collectibility of receivables and our actual bad debts differ from estimates  or we adjust estimates in future periods  our established allowances may be insufficient and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if we provided more allowances than are ultimately required  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods based on our actual collection experience 
in the event we adjust our allowance estimates  it could materially affect our operating results and financial position 
valuation of inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the first in  first out method  with the exception of approximately ten percent of our consolidated net inventories at june   which were determined on a weighted average cost method 
we establish provisions for excess and obsolete inventories after evaluation of historical sales and usage  current economic trends  market conditions  product rationalization  forecasted sales  product lifecycles  and current inventory levels 
this evaluation requires us to make estimates regarding future events in an industry where rapid technological changes are prevalent 
it is possible that increases in inventory reserves may be required in the future if there is a decline in market conditions or if changes in expected product lifecycles occur 
alternatively  if market conditions improve or product lifecycles extend  we may have greater success in selling inventory that had previously been written down 
in either event  the actual value of our inventory may be higher or lower and recognition of such difference will affect our cost of sales in a future period  which could materially affect our operating results and financial position 
valuation of goodwill  other intangible assets  and other long lived assets 
we assess goodwill at least annually for impairment and more frequently if circumstances warrant 
we have chosen the end of the third quarter of each fiscal year as the period for performing our annual assessment 
the impairment assessment is performed in two steps i we determine whether impairment is indicated by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units with its carrying value and ii if there is an indication of impairment  we measure the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
we normally calculate the fair value of our reporting units by using the projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate we determine to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business 
if impairment is indicated  we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to the reporting unit s individual assets and liabilities 
the residual value is the implied fair value of goodwill 
the difference between the carrying amount of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill is recorded as an impairment loss 
we also assess other intangible assets and other long lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets 
when an impairment of goodwill  intangible assets  or long lived assets is determined  it is recorded as a charge against earnings in the period when recognized 
for additional information regarding goodwill and other intangible assets  refer to note of our consolidated financial statements 
restructuring costs 
for restructuring activities initiated prior to december   we recorded restructuring costs in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring and staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges 
restructuring costs were recorded when the company committed to an exit plan and significant changes to the exit plan were not likely 
we estimated the future amounts to be incurred as a result of exit plans and recorded the amounts as a charge against earnings 
for restructuring activities initiated after december   restructuring costs are recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities statement 
the principal difference between statement and eitf issue no 
relates to when an entity can recognize a liability related to exit or disposal costs 
statement requires that a liability be recognized for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred  as opposed to eitf issue no 
 which allowed a liability related to an exit or disposal activity to be recognized on the date an entity committed to an exit plan 
for additional information regarding restructuring costs  refer to note of our consolidated financial statements 
revisions to our estimates could result in an additional charge to earnings or a reversal of previously recorded charges  which could materially affect our operating results and financial position in future periods if anticipated events and key assumptions change 
warranty liabilities 
we warranty our products against defects in materials and workmanship  generally for one to five years  depending upon product lines and geographic regions 
a provision for estimated future costs related to warranty activities is recorded when the product is shipped  based upon our historical experience of known product failure rates and historical costs incurred in correcting product failures 
in addition  from time to time  the recorded amount is adjusted for specifically identified warranty exposures if unforeseen technical problems arise 
in the event that our historical experience of product failure rates and costs of correcting product failures change  or our estimates relating to probable losses resulting from specifically identified warranty exposures change  we may be required to record additional warranty reserves 
alternatively  if we provided more reserves than we needed  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods 
in the event we change our warranty reserve estimates  the resulting charge against future cost of sales or reversal of previously recorded charges may materially affect our operating results and financial position 
accounting for foreign currency translation and transactions 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from the currency in which they keep their accounting records  generally the local currency  into united states dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses which  are either included within the consolidated statement of operations or as a separate component of shareholders equity 
under the relevant accounting guidance the treatment of these translation gains or losses is dependent upon management s determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
the functional currency is determined based upon management s judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions  including billing  financing  payroll and other expenditures would be considered the functional currency but any dependency upon the parent company  and the nature of the subsidiary s operations must also be considered 
if any subsidiary s functional currency is deemed to be the local currency  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of the subsidiary s financial statements is included in shareholders equity 
however  if the functional currency is deemed to be the united states dollar  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of the subsidiary s financial statements would be included within our consolidated statement of operations 
if we dispose of any of our subsidiaries  any cumulative translation gains or losses would be realized in our consolidated statement of operations 
if we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to the united states dollar  any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within our consolidated statement of operations 
we convert the assets and liabilities of foreign operations into their united states dollar equivalents at rates in effect at the balance sheet dates 
the statements of operations of foreign operations are translated from the operation s functional currency to the united states dollar equivalents at average rates for the period 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulting from settlement of foreign receivables and payables  including certain cross currency intercompany activities where payment is expected to be satisfied in the normal course of business  are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
other cross currency intercompany activities  where management has no intent to require payment in the foreseeable future  are recorded in shareholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
in the event management s intent with respect to cross currency intercompany activities changes  such changes could result in future foreign currency gains or losses that may materially affect our operating results and financial position 
accounting for income taxes 
we estimate our income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating our actual current income tax payable and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as reserves and accruals  for tax and accounting purposes 
deferred taxes arise due to temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities and from net operating losses and credit carryforwards 
in general  deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in the company s consolidated statement of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized 
accordingly  realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income against which these deductions  losses and credits can be utilized 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
management considers historical operating losses  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment business combinations on july   we acquired all the outstanding securities of stargus  inc stargus  a privately held company headquartered in andover  massachusetts 
stargus is a provider of comprehensive network and service management solutions for cable broadband operators 
stargus became part of our c cor solutions segment 
the purchase price for the acquisition was million  consisting of a cash payment of million and direct transaction costs of approximately  on september   we acquired certain assets and liabilities of optinel systems  inc optinel  a privately held company located in elkridge  maryland 
optinel is a provider of optical ethernet transport solutions for residential and business services 
optinel became part of our c cor access and transport segment 
the purchase price for the acquisition was million  consisting of a cash payment of million and direct transaction costs of approximately  subject to certain adjustments 
additional cash payments of up to million are required to be made to optinel shareholders if certain sales objectives are achieved within thirteen months from the date of acquisition 
upon satisfaction of the contingency  the additional consideration will be recorded as additional cost of the acquisition and goodwill will increase 
based upon our forecast of the sales objectives through the earn out period  we do not believe additional consideration will result in a material increase in goodwill 
on december   we completed the acquisition of the business of ncube corporation ncube  a privately held company headquartered in beaverton  oregon 
ncube is a worldwide provider of on demand media and digital advertising systems 
ncube became part of our c cor solutions segment 
consideration for the acquisition consisted of million shares of our common stock  million principal amount of our senior unsecured year convertible notes  million in cash  and the assumption of certain liabilities 
we recorded direct costs for the acquisition of approximately  the common stock portion of the purchase consideration was based upon our average common stock price over a period which included two days before and after the measurement date  which was october  based upon the average common stock price  the aggregate purchase consideration was million  excluding certain liabilities assumed 
the cash component of the consideration was funded from our existing cash balances 
during fiscal year  we recorded additional goodwill of million related to acquisitions 
other intangible assets acquired in the acquisitions included million for completed technology and million for customer relationships  which are being amortized over their useful lives of three to five years 
one of the acquired intangible assets was in process research and development  representing research and development projects that were commenced but not yet completed at the date of the acquisitions  and which if unsuccessful  have no alternative future use in research and development activities or otherwise 
the value allocated to in process research and development as of their respective acquisitions dates was million 
the amount allocated to in process research and development was charged to expense as an acquired in process technology charge in the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal year see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for additional information regarding business combinations

fiscal year ended in millions of dollars geographic region june  net sales change from prior year june  net sales change from prior year june  net sales united states europe asia canada latin america consolidated fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
sales on a consolidated basis declined in fiscal year resulting from lower product and technical service sales  which were partially offset by a increase in sales for digital advertising insertion systems and operational support software solutions  which included product lines acquired from ncube 
our largest customers for fiscal year were time warner cable and adelphia  accounting for and  respectively  of net sales 
c cor access and transport segment sales decreased during fiscal year  which was attributable to lower product sales to certain domestic cable operators  including adelphia  comcast and cox  as well as customers in the asia pacific region 
the decline was partially offset by increased sales in europe  as we benefited from increased capital spending in regions such as spain and the united kingdom 
sales of radio frequency amplifiers decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year optical product sales declined  to million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year c cor network services segment sales decreased during fiscal year resulting from lower outside plant technical service revenues related to network upgrade and build out activities  which were partially offset by increased outsourced operational recurring service revenues which include system maintenance  customer service call and installation activities 
c cor solutions segment sales increased for fiscal year  reflecting sales of our operational support systems  as well as sales deriving from the acquisition of ncube 
with the acquisition of ncube  we now provide systems and software for applications such as broadband video on demand vod and advertising insertion to a global customer base 
the ncube acquisition contributed approximately million in sales during the last half of fiscal year the majority of revenues in this segment is derived from sales under multiple element arrangements  whereby revenues are recognized using the completed contract method of accounting or  in some cases  are recognized ratably over the delivery period 
as a result  revenues in the c cor solutions segment are affected by the timing of new orders and customer acceptance requirements 
in fiscal year  we began recognizing software license and associated professional services revenue for our mobile workforce software product line using the percentage of completion method of accounting due to our ability to reliably estimate contract costs at the inception of those contracts 
domestic sales of c cor access and transport and c cor network services segments declined during fiscal year  due to lower spending for both products and technical services by certain cable operators 
these decreases were partially offset by increased domestic sales for our c cor solutions segment  due to product lines acquired from ncube 
international sales increased for c cor access and transport and c cor solutions segments during fiscal year increased sales in europe and latin america were partially offset by lower sales in the asia pacific region 
we believe growth in capital spending in european markets is driven by increased competition for enhanced broadband services requiring telecommunication providers to upgrade their networks to support these enhanced services 
historically  our international sales have been primarily c cor access and transport segment sales  but we anticipate increased revenues internationally from our c cor solutions segment in future periods 
we expect demand for our product line offerings in international markets will continue to be highly variable 
the international markets represent distinct markets in which capital spending decisions for network equipment and solutions are affected by a variety of factors  including access to financing and general economic conditions 
the table below sets forth our backlog by industry segment as of june   compared to june  fiscal year ended in millions of dollars operating segment june  backlog change june  backlog c cor access and transport c cor network services c cor solutions consolidated our backlog increased for c cor access transport primarily due to increased bookings from international customers 
our backlog decreased for c cor network services due to the substantial completion of system upgrade work from adelphia and changes made during the year to our criteria for recognizing customer commitments as backlog and for quantifying the amounts to be included in backlog in this segment 
the increase in backlog for c cor solutions resulted from acquired backlog from ncube  as well as increased domestic and international software license and maintenance bookings during the year 
we include in backlog customer orders that are anticipated to result in revenue being recognized over the next twelve months 
the majority of orders in backlog for c cor access and transport will result in revenue over the next six months while orders in backlog of the other two segments typically include a portion that will result in revenue over the latter part of the twelve month period 
we make management decisions based on our backlog  including hiring of personnel  purchasing of materials  and other matters that may increase our production capabilities and costs 
cancellations  delays or reductions of orders could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
gross margin 
the following table sets forth our gross margins by operating segment for fiscal year compared to fiscal year fiscal year ended operating segment june  gross margin change points june  gross margin c cor access and transport c cor network services c cor solutions consolidated consolidated gross margins decreased during fiscal year  resulting from shifts in product mix during the year 
for the c cor access and transport segment  gross margins increased due to product mix changes and million of lower warranty costs resulting from settlement of previously recorded specific warranty liabilities for amounts below their recorded value during the year 
for the c cor network services segment  gross margins declined due to higher project costs associated with upgrade projects and lower sales volume 
for the c cor solutions segment  gross margins for the year declined as a result of product mix  as product lines acquired from ncube had lower margins than our other solution products 
we anticipate that our future gross margins in our business segments will continue to be affected by many factors  including revenue levels in general  sales mix  competitive pricing pressures  the timing of new product introductions  and the timing of deployments for certain of our content and operations management support systems 
selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses were million of net sales in fiscal year  compared to million of net sales in fiscal year selling and administrative expenses increased during the period as a result of increases in personnel and administrative expense due to the lantern communications  inc lantern and alopa networks  inc alopa acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and the stargus  optinel  and ncube acquisitions completed during fiscal year additional increases in costs were incurred during the year associated with marketing and promotional expenses and accounting and consulting fees related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of research and product development 
research and product development expenses were million of net sales in fiscal year compared to million of net sales in fiscal year research and product development expenses in the c cor access and transport segment were million for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year the increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs resulting from the acquisition of lantern in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and optinel during fiscal year research and product development expenses in the c cor solutions segment were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year the increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs resulting from the acquisitions of alopa in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and stargus and ncube during fiscal year other research and product development expenses  not charged to segments  were million in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year the increase related to various general operating costs  including increased personnel costs 
we believe sustained commitment to product development efforts will be required for us to remain competitive  and anticipate continuing investments in research and product development in future periods related to network distribution and transmission products  on demand systems  and operational support software solutions 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges were  in fiscal year compared to a recovery of restructuring charges of  in fiscal year during our second quarter of fiscal year  we implemented restructuring initiatives to improve our operating performance and to eliminate redundancies resulting from acquisitions 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we incurred restructuring costs associated with settlement of certain contractual obligations related to closing our pleasanton  california  facility  as well as employee severance and termination benefits associated with transitioning our manufacturing operation in klagenfurt  austria  to a contract manufacturer in the region 
the restructuring charges during the year represented employee termination benefits for employees 
operating income loss by segment 
operating income excluding unallocated items for the c cor access and transport segment in fiscal year was million  compared to operating income of million in fiscal year the decrease in operating income for fiscal year was primarily attributable to lower revenues and higher operating expenses  primarily research and development costs  resulting from the acquisition of lantern in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and optinel during fiscal year operating income excluding unallocated items for the c cor network services segment in fiscal year was million  compared to million in fiscal year the decrease in operating income for fiscal year was due to lower revenues and gross margin which resulted from higher project costs for upgrades  primarily for adelphia  during fiscal year operating loss excluding unallocated items for the c cor solutions segment in fiscal year was million  compared to operating income of  in fiscal year the increased operating loss for this segment in fiscal year resulted from lower gross margins and increased operating expense  primarily for research and development costs resulting from the acquisitions of alopa during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  and stargus and ncube during fiscal year interest expense and investment income 
interest expense was  in fiscal year compared to  in fiscal year the increase during fiscal year resulted from interest expense associated with our senior unsecured convertible notes issued on december   in the acquisition of ncube 
investment income was million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year investment income increased in fiscal year due to higher investment returns compared to fiscal year gain on sale of bankruptcy trade claims 
during fiscal year  no additional payments were received associated with the sale of our pre petition bankruptcy trade claim against adelphia and affiliates 
during fiscal year  we received million in an initial cash payment for the sale of substantially all of our pre petition bankruptcy trade claims 
additional amounts are being held in escrow pending the resolution of certain contingencies  and we could receive an additional payment of approximately million  although the timing and amount of such recovery is uncertain at this time 
income tax expense benefit 
income tax benefit was  for fiscal year compared with income tax expense for fiscal year of million 
income tax benefit for fiscal year included current taxes payable for state and foreign income taxes in certain jurisdictions where we were profitable  and generally reflected cash taxes payable  which was offset by the reversal of approximately million in certain tax contingencies settled during the year 
the company has assessed the realizability of its deferred tax assets  giving consideration to historical operating losses  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies 
management concluded during the third quarter of fiscal year  as a result of the cumulative losses over the previous three years that a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets was appropriate and recorded an allowance as of that date 
as of june   realization of any future benefit from deductible temporary differences  net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is uncertain in many of the taxing jurisdictions in which the company operates 
therefore  we have continued to maintain a valuation allowance for substantially all of its deferred tax assets  with the exception of deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions where the company is profitable 
we expect to maintain valuation allowances related to deferred tax benefits until a level of profitability is achieved and sustained in the applicable tax jurisdiction that demonstrates it is more likely than not that the company will be able to realize all or part of the deferred tax assets 
in the event that we reverse the valuation allowance in the future  reported tax expense subsequent to such action will increase and will likely approximate the statutory rates in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
the increase in consolidated net sales for fiscal year was the result of capital spending and system upgrades by certain customers  primarily adelphia  which positively affected both product and technical services revenues during the year  and increased spending on operational support software solutions 
our largest customers for fiscal year were adelphia and time warner cable  accounting for and  respectively  of net sales 
the increase in c cor access and transport segment sales during fiscal year was primarily driven by increased capital spending by adelphia and growth in our international sales 
sales of radio frequency amplifiers increased  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year optical product sales declined  to million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year shifts in product mix resulted from new build and upgrade requirements  which depend on the network architecture deployed by our customers 
the increase in c cor network services segment sales during fiscal year resulted from increased spending by domestic cable operators  primarily adelphia  on technical services  related to our outside plant technical services operations  which include system sweep  reverse path activation  ingress mitigation  node certification  and system maintenance 
the increase in c cor solutions segment sales during fiscal year was a result of customer acceptance of various network and workforce management software projects during the year 
our software revenues during fiscal year were primarily recognized using the completed contract method 
domestic sales increased in all three of our operating segments during fiscal year for our c cor access and transport segment and our c cor network services segment  the increase was driven by spending for both capital equipment and technical services by certain cable operators  primarily adelphia 
the increase for our c cor solutions segment was driven by increased deployments of network and workforce management software 
international sales increased in all geographic regions with the exception of canada during fiscal year our international sales were primarily c cor access and transport segment sales 
the table below sets forth our backlog by industry segment as of june   compared to june  fiscal year ended in millions of dollars operating segment june  backlog change june  backlog c cor access and transport c cor network services c cor solutions consolidated our backlog increased for the c cor access and transport segment primarily due to increased bookings from international customers during the period 
our backlog increased in c cor network services due to increased bookings of system upgrade work  primarily from adelphia  during the period 
the decline in backlog for c cor solutions resulted from the completion of several contracts during the year and lower new software bookings during the period 
gross margin 
the following table sets forth our gross margins by operating segment for fiscal year compared to fiscal year fiscal year ended operating segment june  gross margin change points june  gross margin c cor access and transport c cor network services c cor solutions consolidated our gross margin increased in fiscal year as a result of increased gross margins in all operating segments 
gross margin for our c cor access and transport segment was positively affected in fiscal year by higher volume and reduced costs resulting from the closing of our manlius  new york manufacturing facility in fiscal year the gross margin for our c cor access and transport segment for fiscal year was affected by a million charge for an excess and obsolete inventory provision resulting from significant reductions in demand levels  product line rationalization decisions for overlapping product lines resulting from acquisitions  transition to an outsourced manufacturer of product lines determined to be at the end of their product lifecycle  and a refinement of our reserve estimation process to quantify reserve requirements for inventory levels in excess of our forecasted demand 
the increase in c cor network services segment gross margin was due primarily to increased volume levels and labor and overhead efficiencies 
c cor solutions segment gross margin increased as a result of the higher revenue recognized on network and workforce management software projects  due to the timing of customer acceptances 
selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses were million of net sales in fiscal year  compared to million of net sales in fiscal year the decrease resulted from reductions in our workforce implemented in fiscal year to achieve a more favorable cost structure  the collection of million in delinquent accounts receivable that were previously reserved for  and the settlement of a liability related to certain marketing costs for  less than its recorded value 
research and product development

accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb published fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin  which will result in a more consistent recognition of liabilities relating to asset retirement obligations  b more information about expected future cash outflows associated with those obligations  and c more information about investments in long lived assets because additional asset retirement costs will be recognized as part of the carrying amounts of the assets 
fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the time and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
uncertainty about the time and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  retrospective application of interim financial information is permitted but is not required 
early adoption of this interpretation is encouraged 
as fin was recently issued  we have not determined whether we will adopt fin early but does not expect the adoption to have a significant adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations

r  share based payment statement r 
statement r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  statement and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
statement r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
statement r requires entities to recognize compensation cost for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
statement r is effective for us in the first annual reporting period that begins after june  we are required to adopt statement r on june   using the modified prospective application method of statement r 
under the modified prospective application method  awards that are granted  modified or settled after the date of adoption will be measured and accounted for in accordance with statement r 
unvested equity classified awards that were granted prior to the effective date would continue to be accounted for in accordance with statement except that amounts must be recognized in the income statement 
adoption of statement r will not affect our cash flows  but it will reduce reported income and earnings per share because we currently use the intrinsic value method as permitted by opinion no 
accordingly  no compensation cost is currently recognized for share purchase rights granted under the company s employee stock option plans 
the adoption of statement r will result in the company recording compensation cost for employee stock options 
had the company expensed employee stock options under statement  in prior periods the impact of that standard would have been as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share in note to the consolidated financial statements 
changes in assumptions under statement r could impact compensation costs in the future
