net receivables were determined based upon the company s evaluation of known requirements  aging of receivables  historical experience and the current economic environment 
amounts associated with potential return of products as well as customer chargebacks  net of expected recoveries  are reflected in net accounts receivable 
these types of allowances are reflected as a reduction of sales upon the determination that such allowances are reasonably estimatible and probable 
while the company believes it has appropriately considered known or expected outcomes  its customers ability to pay their obligations  including those to the company  could be adversely affected by declining sales of apparel at retail resulting from such factors as contraction in the economy or a general decline in consumer spending

and earnings before income taxes by approximately 
inventory valuation at november   inventories were million  and reflected the lifo valuation method for certain work in process and finished goods  as well as reductions from cost when required in order to state inventories at the lower of cost or market

a tax valuation reserve could be required in whole or in part in the future should the company s actual earnings or prospective earnings decrease the likelihood that sufficient taxable earnings will be generated to fully utilize the available carryforwards

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the value of net tangible assets of businesses acquired 
effective december   goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are not being amortized  but instead are tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indications arise

the fair value allocated to the tradename  which was deemed to have an indefinite life and which is not being amortized  was million 
the tradename was valued using an income approach considering the relief from royalty and excess earnings methodologies 
the estimated remaining useful life was determined to be indefinite based on the current expectation to continue to use and promote the tradename indefinitely and the lack of any legal or economic constraint associated with the tradename 
should the operations of the businesses with which goodwill or indefinite life intangible is associated incur significant declines in profitability and cash flow in future years  some or all of the recorded goodwill or intangibles could be subject to impairment 
based on achieving historical operating margins  if the current estimate of revenues used in the cash flow projections for cag declined by to or the assumed cost of capital was increased by approximately basis points  an impairment of goodwill for cag could be required 
the value assigned to the misook tradename could be subject to possible impairment to the extent that the misook brand was to experience significant future declines in demand resulting from such factors as consumer spending for apparel and retailers expectations of future apparel product sales

the determination of insurance claims and the appropriateness of the related liability accruals are reviewed and updated at regular intervals  based upon such factors as recent experience of ongoing claims  new claims initiated and claims settled during the period 
the amount of future payments to be made for workers compensation and employee group health claims cannot be quantified with precision
