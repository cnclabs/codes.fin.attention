item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
orthopaedic products industry according to a research report published by gabelli company  inc in december  the worldwide market for orthopaedic products in was estimated to be billion  and is expected to grow at a rate of to annually over the next ten years 
according to this study  four market segments in which the company offers its products and services  knee reconstructive devices  hip reconstructive devices  biologic materials and other products which includes instrumentation and other orthopaedic products  were estimated to be billion  billion  billion and billion  respectively  during management shares the belief that the industry will continue to grow due to an aging population in much of the world 
the same report by gabelli company highlighted us census bureau statistics that reveal the number of people who are over the age of in the united states is projected to increase steadily to million by the year  as compared to million in increasing life spans impact the number of individuals with joints subject to failure  thereby increasing demand for joint replacement procedures 
products the company s joint replacement implant products are used by orthopaedic surgeons to repair or replace joints that have deteriorated as a result of injury or disease 
reconstructive joint surgery involves the modification of the area surrounding the affected joint and the insertion of a set of manufactured implant components to replace or augment the joint 
during the surgery  the surgeon removes damaged cartilage and a portion of the bones that comprise the joint  prepares the remaining bone surfaces and surrounding tissue and then installs the implant 
when necessary  the surgeon uses biologic allograft materials  like those distributed by exactech  to repair bone defects and provide an environment to stimulate new bone growth 
in many joint replacement procedures  acrylic bone cement is used to affix implant components to the prepared bone surfaces 

table of contents the following table includes the net revenue and percentage of net sales for each of the company s product lines for the years ended december   and sales revenue by product line dollars in thousands year ended december  december  december  knee implants hip implants biologics other products total knee implants 
the company believes that its optetrak knee system represents a major advance in knee implant design 
the optetrak knee system is a modular system designed to improve the movement of the knee cap  which is called patellar tracking  reduce the force between surfaces in a joint  also called articular contact stress  that leads to implant failure  and provide a functional range of motion 
the optetrak system provides for a variety of femoral components which relate to the thighbone  or femur  region  and includes a total primary knee replacement system which is available with either a cruciate ligament sparing femoral component in both cemented and porous coated designs and used in situations where the surgeon chooses to maintain certain ligaments or a posterior stabilized femoral component in both cemented and porous coated designs and used in situations where the surgeon chooses to eliminate certain ligaments 
the optetrak system also includes a constrained total knee system for revision surgery and primary surgery with severe deformities 
the constrained version includes two types of femoral components the constrained condylar modular femoral component and a constrained non modular femoral component 
the modular component includes stem and block augmentation to aid in repairing damaged or weakened bone 
the constrained condylar femoral component was designed to provide greater constraint between the tibial and femoral components of the system to compensate for ligaments weakened or lost due to disease or as a result of failure of previous treatments 
during  the company began full scale marketing of an asymmetrical femoral component product line extension to the optetrak system 
this line extension includes a cruciate sparing  posterior stabilized and a new high flexion line 
these asymmetrical line extensions will provide for differentiated right and left femoral components that the company hopes will be successful in meeting surgeon preferences 
in  the company plans to further expand the optetrak line with introduction of a unicondylar knee designed for cases where only one compartment of the knee is replaced  low profile instrumentation for reduced incision surgery and a rotating bearing knee system for international markets 
in march  the company commenced distributing link s line of implant products which includes the link endo model tm rotational knee  designed to provide stability with controlled rotation for severe joint deterioration with insufficient ligament support and the link endo model tm sled uni knee  designed for cases where only a portion of a joint warrants replacement 
hip implants 
the company s line of hip implant and instrument products includes the acumatch integrated hip system which is designed to address the majority of requirements for total hip replacement  including primary and revision needs 
the system includes the c series cemented femoral stem  the a series acetabular components for the hip socket  the p series press fit femoral stem  the m series modular femoral stem  the l series femoral stem system  bipolar and unipolar partial hip replacement components  a variety of femoral heads and a cemented acetabular component 
the acumatch cemented revision components include revision long stems and calcar replacement stems that were originally part of the aura revision hip system 

table of contents the company s acumatch c series cemented femoral stem is a forged cobalt chromium stem designed to improve stability and reduce dislocation complications by improving the head neck ratio and restoring anatomic offset for patients requiring cemented total hip arthroplasty  or joint reconstructive surgery 
the acumatch a series was designed to provide a comprehensive acetabular offering with sufficient polyethylene thickness to help lower stresses in the polyethylene liner 
the acumatch m series modular femoral stem offers components that are interchangeable  allowing the surgeon to customize the prosthesis at the time of surgery and according to the patient s bony structures 
this versatility and the manner in which the components mate can have a positive effect on patient outcomes 
the acumatch p series press fit femoral stem system has multiple coating options for fixation to bone and features a scientifically sound solution to stiffness mismatch and rotational instability in the bone  potential underlying causes of post operative residual thigh pain 
the acumatch l series hip system features both cemented and press fit femoral components  as well as unipolar and bipolar endoprostheses  often used for the treatment of hip fractures 
a low profile instrumentation system was launched during to support cases in which the surgeon may choose a smaller incision length 
the link hip implant product lines distributed by the company include the mp tm modular femoral revision stem  offering surgeons a product specifically designed and required for situations where there is deficient proximal bone the top quarter of the femur 
this unique design offers enhanced stability and fatigue strength over and above competitive stems indicated for similar clinical situations 
also distributed by the company is the link saddle prosthesis  a salvage type prosthesis designed to support the pelvic region when the acetabulum cannot be reconstructed  the link spii hip stem  and the link partial pelvis 
beginning in  the company plans to introduce initial components of the new novation hip system  which the company feels will make its hip offerings more competitive 
the novation hip system will ultimately feature press fit and cemented primary femoral stems  press fit revision stems  and a comprehensive acetabular system which will be designed to incorporate the use of enhanced polyethylene as well as future alternative bearing couples such as ceramic on ceramic and diamond on diamond 
both the ceramic and diamond bearing alternatives are expected to require a food and drug administration fda approval process that will extend beyond biologics 
the company is the exclusive  worldwide distributor of bone paste materials processed by rti for use in non spinal musculoskeletal orthopaedic procedures 
these unique allograft materials are distributed as opteform and optefil and are clinically proven for effectively repairing bone and filling bone defects 
during  the company obtained the distribution rights to optefil as part of the settlement of its arbitration with rti 
during  the company continued to expand the breadth of its allograft materials line in cooperation with rti by releasing the optefil rt line and intends to release an opteform rt line during early these room temperature  or rt  lines are allograft products that are distributed in a non frozen form 
as an addendum to the rti distribution agreement  the company also initiated distribution of regenaform and regenafil product lines during july for usage in oral and dental applications 
in march  the company received clearance from the fda to market a new demineralized bone matrix  or dbm  based human allograft material 
the company intends a limited release of this material to market in early optecure tm includes a synthetic bioabsorbable polymer carrier technology  previously licensed from genzyme corp

other products 
the acudriver automated osteotome system is an air driven impact hand piece that assists surgeons during joint implant revision procedures by aiding in effective removal of failed prostheses and bone cement 
the acudriver accomplishes this by providing the surgeon with precise positioning without the inconvenience and inconsistency of striking the osteotome with a mallet 
the link star tm ankle is currently distributed under terms of an fda approved investigational device exemption ide  however  there is no assurance that exactech will continue to 
table of contents distribute the star tm ankle product in the future 
the company also distributes link surgical instrumentation that can be used in various orthopaedic procedures including shoulder  knee  spine  foot  ankle and hip arthroplasty 
the cemex bone cement system features a unique self contained delivery system that has been clinically proven in europe for more than a decade 
by integrating bone cement powder and liquid into a sealed mixing system  cemex is designed to offer surgeons and operating room personnel simplicity  safety and reliability in bone cement 
the company distributes cemex in the united states under an exclusive distribution agreement with the italian manufacturer  tecres spa in june  exactech gained fda clearance and began marketing cemex genta  a bone cement containing antibiotics 
in the company announced that tecres had received clearance from the fda to market pre formed cement hip and knee spacer products containing an antibiotic that is included in the company s distribution agreement 
the interspace tm hip and knee spacers are used in two stage revision procedures involving an infection with a previously implanted prosthesis and provides orthopaedic surgeons with a new  convenient way to treat this difficult problem 
the company began marketing the spacers in in  the company acquired rights to a patented total shoulder system from teknimed  sa teknimed  a french manufacturer of orthopaedic implants and processor of biological products 
teknimed continued to manufacture and distribute the shoulder system in europe for the company while exactech established appropriate manufacturing support and upgraded the design 
in november  the company received fda clearance for marketing the equinoxe tm shoulder system in the united states in limited release 
full market release is scheduled for the first quarter of marketing and sales the company markets its orthopaedic implant products in the united states through fifty independent sales agencies and one domestic distributor 
these agencies  along with their independently contracted personnel  serve as the company s sales representatives 
internationally  the company markets its products through twenty two distributors that currently distribute products in twenty five countries 
the customers for the company s products are hospitals  surgeons and other physicians and clinics 
the company generally has contractual arrangements with its independent sales agencies whereby the agency is granted the exclusive right to sell the company s products in the specified territory 
in turn  the agency is required to meet sales quotas to maintain its relationship with the company 
the company typically pays its sales agencies a commission based on net sales 
the company is highly dependent on the expertise and customer relationships of its sales agencies 
the company s sales organization is managed by six regional directors of sales assigned to the east  central  midwest  southeast  southwest and west regions 
the company has a contractual arrangement with its domestic distributor that is similar to its arrangements with its sales agencies  except the company does not pay the distributor commissions and the distributor purchases inventory from the company for use in fulfilling customer orders 
the company currently offers its products in all fifty states  and the district of columbia 
the company provides inventories of its products to its united states sales agencies until sold or returned 
these inventories are necessary for sales agents to market the company s products and fill customer orders 
the size of the component to be used for a specific patient is typically not known with certainty until the time of surgery 
due to this uncertainty  a minimum of one of each size of each component in the system to be used must be available to each sales agency at the time of surgery 
accordingly  the company is required to maintain substantial levels of inventory 
the maintenance of relatively high levels of inventory requires the company to incur significant expenditures of its resources 
the failure by the company to maintain required levels of inventory could have a material adverse effect on the company s expansion 
as a result of the need to maintain substantial levels of inventory  the company is subject to the risk of inventory obsolescence 
in the event that a substantial portion of the company s inventory becomes obsolete  it would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company reviews its inventory for obsolescence on a regular basis and adjusts its inventory for impairment 
during  and  approximately  and  respectively  of the company s sales were derived from a major hospital customer 
during   and  one international distributor accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s sales 

table of contents the company generally has contractual arrangements with its international distributors pursuant to which the distributor is granted the exclusive right to market the company s products in the specified territory and the distributor is required to meet sales quotas to maintain its relationship with the company 
international distributors typically purchase product inventory and instruments from the company for their use in marketing and filling customer orders

of those international sales  sales to the company s spanish distributor accounted for   and  in  and  respectively 
the company intends to continue to expand its sales in international markets in which there is increasing demand for orthopaedic implant products 
manufacturing and supply early in its history  the company utilized third party vendors for the manufacture of all of its component parts  while internally performing product design  quality assurance and packaging 
at present  the company manufactures approximately of its components in its manufacturing facility and headquarters in gainesville  florida 
the company has continued to increase the number of internally manufactured components 
with the increase of internal manufacturing  the company has experienced a greater degree of control of production costs  and it expects this trend to continue 
the company continually assesses the manufacturing capabilities and cost effectiveness of its existing and potential vendors in its attempts to secure its supply chain and decrease dependency on key suppliers 
for the years ended december   and  the company purchased approximately  and  respectively  of its externally sourced component requirements from its top three suppliers 
the company does not maintain supply contracts with most of its manufacturers  and purchases components pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
the company has alternative sources for components 
while the company does not anticipate that it will encounter problems in obtaining adequate supplies of components  it cannot provide assurance that it will continue to be able to obtain components under acceptable terms and in a timely manner 
certain tooling and equipment unique to the company s products are supplied by the company to its suppliers 
order backlog is not a material aspect of the company s business 
the company s internal manufacturing  assembly  packaging and quality control operations are conducted at its principal offices in gainesville  florida 
components received from its suppliers as well as internally manufactured are examined by company personnel prior to assembly or packaging to ensure that the company s specifications and standards are maintained 
patents and proprietary technology  license and consulting agreements the company holds united states and international patents covering several of its implant components  biologic materials technologies and some of its surgical instrumentation 
the company believes that patents and intellectual property will continue to be important in the orthopaedic industry 
in this regard  the company defends its intellectual property rights and believes that its patents and products do not and will not infringe patents or violate proprietary rights of others  although it is possible that its existing patent rights may not be valid or that infringement of existing or future patents or proprietary rights may occur 
in the event some of the company s intellectual property and agreements relating to its products are deemed invalid  such action could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in connection with the development of its knee implant systems  the company pays royalties to dr 
william petty and dr 
gary miller  who are executive officers and principal shareholders of the company 
dr 
petty also serves as chairman of the company s board of directors 
new employment agreements entered into between the company and each of drs 
petty and miller on january  provide for the continuation of the royalty payments in addition to their regular compensation as executive officers 
compensation associated with these agreements is the only compensation paid by the company to drs 
petty and miller 
the company has entered into a verbal consulting agreement with albert burstein  phd  a 
table of contents director of the company  to provide services regarding many facets of the orthopaedic industry including product design rationale  manufacturing and development techniques and product sales and marketing 
during  the company paid dr 
burstein  as compensation under this consulting agreement 
research and development during  and  the company expended   and  respectively  on research and development and anticipates that research and development expenses will continue to increase 
the company s research and development efforts contributed to the successful integration of the acumatch hip systems  line extensions of the optetrak knee system and design improvements targeted to improving internal manufacturing efficiency 
the company s research and development efforts continue to focus on implant product line extensions  advanced biologic materials  extremity joint reconstruction and alternative bearing surfaces 
as an important part of its research and development efforts  the company has developed strategic partnerships through agreements with genzyme biosurgery and diamicron corporation to bring expertise in advanced materials to the company s products 
the agreement with genzyme is for the development of polymer based synthetic biomaterials that when delivered with other biologic products support the growth of new bone 
through its agreement with diamicron  the company intends to apply diamicron s polycrystalline diamond compact  or pdc  technology to its hip implants 
this diamond technology holds the promise of improved mechanical and wear characteristics over currently available technology 
this technology will likely require a number of years of development and regulatory clearance prior to the release of products for sale 
the company believes that the purchase of intellectual property and product line assets augmented by additional development provides a cost effective and efficient way to bring products to market and expects to continue to do so in the future to complement its internal product development 
competition the orthopaedic industry is highly competitive and dominated by a number of large companies with substantially greater financial and other resources than exactech 
the largest competitors in the orthopaedic market are depuy  inc  a division of johnson and johnson  zimmer  inc  a subsidiary of zimmer holdings  inc  stryker howmedica osteonics  a subsidiary of stryker corp  smith and nephew plc  and biomet orthopaedics  a subsidiary of biomet  inc these five companies  according to the medical and healthcare marketplace guide  published by dorland healthcare information  had an estimated aggregate market share of approximately in companies in the industry compete on the basis of product features and design  innovation  service  the ability to maintain new product flow  relationships with key orthopaedic surgeons and hospitals  the strength of their distribution network and price 
while price is a key factor in the orthopaedic market  there are other significant factors  including surgeon preference  ease of use  clinical results  and service provided by the company and its representatives 
product liability and insurance the company is subject to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design  marketing and sale of orthopaedic implants and surgical instrumentation 
the company has implemented strict quality control measures and currently maintains product liability insurance in amounts that it believes are typical in the industry for similar companies 
during  the company experienced substantial increases in insurance premiums primarily due to the conditions of the insurance market in general and specifically the medical device insurance market 
during  the company experienced stabilization of these insurance premiums as a percentage of sales 
the company annually evaluates its levels of product liability insurance  as well as the amount of retention carried compared to other companies in the industry 
due to the volatility of the insurance marketplace  the value of the product liability insurance products delivered and the small number of providers of these products  there can be no guarantees as to whether the company will be able to secure such coverage in the future at a cost deemed to be appropriate 

table of contents government regulation the company is subject to government regulation in the united states and other countries in which it conducts business

violation of these laws is a felony  punishable by fines up to  per violation and imprisonment for up to five years 
civil penalties may also be imposed which exclude violators from participation in medicare or state health programs 
regulators may challenge or review the company s current or future activities under these laws which would be costly and time consuming and could reduce cash flows and revenues 
significant prohibitions against physician referrals were enacted by congress in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of these laws prohibit  subject to specified exemptions  a physician or a member of his immediate family from referring medicare or medicaid patients to an entity providing designated health services in which the physician has an ownership or investment interest  or with which the physician has entered into a compensation arrangement 
the penalties for violating these laws include a prohibition on payment by these government programs and civil penalties of as much as  for each violative referral and  for participation in a circumvention scheme 
the violation of these laws by the company could result in significant fines or penalties and exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
while the company is unable to predict the extent to which its business may be affected by future regulatory developments  it believes that its substantial experience in dealing with governmental regulatory requirements and restrictions throughout the world should enable it to continue to compete effectively within this increasingly regulated environment

item legal proceedings there are various claims  lawsuits and disputes with third parties and pending actions involving various allegations against the company incident to the operation of its business  principally product liability cases 
the company is currently a party to two product liability suits 
both claims seek unspecified damages related to the alleged defective design  manufacture and or sale of the company s total joint arthroplasty products 
these claims are currently in discovery stages 
while the company believes that these claims are without merit  and intends to vigorously defend them  the company is unable to predict the outcome of such litigation 
the company therefore maintains insurance  subject to self insured retention limits  for these and all such claims  and establishes accruals for product liability and other claims based upon the company s experience with similar past claims  advice of counsel and the best information available
