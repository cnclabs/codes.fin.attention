business trends our financial results continue to be affected by the changing dynamics in the home video and game rental market  as they impact our ppt business 
we continue to experience the impact of the migration from higher historical rentals of cassettes to greater rentals of dvds by our participating retailers 
we have successfully implemented new agreements with program suppliers to incorporate the availability of dvds  and we are continuing our efforts in fiscal to secure more dvd arrangements to address this impact 
in addition  our ppt business continues to be affected by a shift to output programs under which we agree with a program supplier to a lower order processing and transaction fee in exchange for the participating retailers commitment to order a greater number of units of all the program supplier s titles 
the result is an increased number of units leased by the participating retailers  but a reduced amount of fees per unit earned by the program supplier and us 
these output programs are  in part  an economic response to the changing dynamics of the home video rental market  and have become more prevalent since the migration from cassette format to the dvd format 
we expect the growth of these output programs to continue  and believe that they will be financially beneficial for the participating retailers  program suppliers and us 
our base of participating retailers continues to be strong

additionally  a second program supplier represented and a third represented of our total revenues in fiscal as is typical of our agreements with program suppliers  our relationship with these program suppliers may be terminated without cause upon thirty days written notice by either party 
we are also allocating significant resources towards our business intelligence service offerings  both those services that are currently operational as well as those that are in various stages of development 
our suite of business intelligence software has been well received in the various targeted markets to date  as our offerings fit well with the needs identified by those market participants 
we intend to continue to make the necessary increased investments in these new business intelligence services in the near term  lowering our earnings 
we believe these services will provide significant future revenue and earnings streams and ultimately be the cornerstone of our long term success

prior to march   it was determined that  more likely than not  substantially all of pf s assets would be sold or otherwise disposed of 
as a result of this determination  during the quarter ended march   we assessed the current and historical operating and cash flow losses  prospects for growth in revenues and other alternatives for improving the operating results of pf

contractual payment obligations a summary of our contractual commitments and obligations as of march  is as follows payments due by fiscal period contractual obligation total and and and beyond capital leases operating leases program supplier guarantees executive compensation critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  significant accounting policies  for additional information 
allowance for doubtful accounts credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable by monitoring past due balances 
if it is determined that a customer may be unable to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve is established based on the amount we expect to recover 
an additional general reserve is provided based on aging of accounts receivable and our historical collection experience 
if circumstances change related to specific customers  overall aging of accounts receivable or collection experience  our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could materially change 
our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled  and  respectively  at march  and program supplier reserves we have entered into guarantee contracts with certain program suppliers providing titles for distribution under our ppt system 
these contracts guarantee the program suppliers minimum payments that are recoupable based on revenue sharing activity 
in some cases  these guarantees are paid in advance 
for amounts not paid in advance  we record a liability for the gross amount of the guarantee due to the program supplier on the street date in accordance with statement of position  accounting by producers or distributors of films sop 
the unearned portion of the guarantees is included as advances to program suppliers on our consolidated balance sheets 
using historical experience and year to date rental experience for each title  we estimate the projected revenue to be generated under each guarantee 
we have historically been able to reasonably estimate shortages after to days of rental activity 
we then establish a program supplier reserve for titles that are projected to experience a shortage under the provisions of the guarantee 
the program supplier reserve is netted against advances to program suppliers on our consolidated balance sheets 
we continually review these factors and make adjustments to the reserves as needed 
actual results could differ from these estimates and could have a material effect on the recorded program supplier reserves 
the balance in this reserve totaled million and million  respectively  at march  and deferred taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 deferred tax assets arise from the tax benefit of amounts expensed for financial reporting purposes but not yet deducted for tax purposes and from unutilized tax credits and nol carry forwards 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
to the extent it is determined the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is unlikely  we will record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
as of march  and  we had a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively  recorded against our canadian net operating loss carryforwards 
net deferred tax assets totaled million and million  respectively  as of march  and new accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of new accounting pronouncements 
off balance sheet arrangements other than disclosed above under contractual payment obligations  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have considered the provisions of financial reporting release no 
disclosure of accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments  and disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information about market risk inherent in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments 
we had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at march  a review of our other financial instruments and risk exposures at that date revealed that we had exposure to interest rate risk related to our cash deposits 
we utilized sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect of this risk and concluded that near term changes in interest rates should not materially adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
