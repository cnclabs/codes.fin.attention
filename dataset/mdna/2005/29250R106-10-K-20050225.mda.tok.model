item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements  which we prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and our accompanying notes listed in the index to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this annual report on form k 
business overview we provide services to our customers and create value for our unitholders primarily through the following activities interstate transportation and storage of crude oil and liquid petroleum  gathering  treating  processing and transmission of natural gas providing supply  transmission and sales service  including purchasing and selling of natural gas and natural gas liquids ngls 
we primarily provide fee based services to our customers to minimize commodity price risks 
however  in our natural gas business  a portion of our earnings and cash flows are exposed to movements in the prices of natural gas and ngls 
to substantially mitigate this exposure  we enter into derivative financial instrument hedge transactions 
we conduct our business through three business segments liquids  natural gas and marketing 
these segments are strategic business units established by senior management to facilitate the achievement of our long term objectives  to aid in resource allocation decisions and to assess operational performance 
liquids our liquids segment includes the operations of our lakehead  north dakota  and mid continent systems 
the lakehead and north dakota systems largely consist of ferc regulated interstate crude oil and liquid petroleum pipelines 
these systems generate most of their revenues by charging shippers a per barrel tariff rate to transport crude oil and liquid petroleum 
our lakehead system links crude oil production from western canada to markets in the great lakes and midwest regions of the united states and the province of ontario  canada 
western canadian crude oil production comes from two primary sources  conventional drilling and oil sands extraction projects 
currently  conventional drilling produces the majority of the supply  however  with the number of new oil sands projects in progress  this stable source of crude oil supply is expected to increase significantly over the next ten years 
deliveries on our north dakota system are impacted by the willingness of crude oil producers to maintain their production and exploration activities in north dakota  montana and the province of saskatchewan  canada 
similar to our lakehead system  our north dakota system depends upon demand for crude oil in the great lakes and midwest regions of the united states 
our mid continent system was purchased in march these assets consist of approximately miles of crude oil pipelines and million barrels of storage capacity  which serve refineries in the us mid continent region from cushing  oklahoma 
this system s revenues are primarily toll or fee based from a combination of regulated assets and contracted unregulated assets 
natural gas our natural gas segment consists of natural gas gathering and transmission pipelines  treating plants and processing plants 
collectively  these systems include approximately  miles of natural gas gathering and transmission pipelines including four ferc regulated transmission pipeline systems  fourteen natural gas treating plants twenty two natural gas processing plants  and trucks  trailers and railcars used for transporting ngls  crude oil and carbon dioxide 
we receive revenues in our natural gas segment under the following types of arrangements fee based arrangements under a fee based contract  we receive a set fee for gathering  treating  processing and transmission of raw natural gas and providing other gathering services 
these revenues correlate with volumes and types of service  and do not depend directly on commodity prices 
revenues of our natural gas segment that are derived from transmission services consist of reservation fees charged for transmission of natural gas on the ferc regulated interstate natural gas transmission pipeline systems  while revenues from intrastate pipelines are generally derived from the bundled sales of natural gas and transmission services 
customers of our ferc regulated natural gas pipeline systems typically pay a reservation fee each month to reserve capacity plus a nominal commodity charge based on actual transmission volumes 
revenues are recognized as natural gas is delivered to customers or as transportation services are rendered 
we prefer fee based contracts because they produce relatively stable cash flows 
other arrangements we also utilize other types of arrangements in our natural gas segment  including percentage of index contracts under these contracts  we purchase raw natural gas at a negotiated discount to an agreed upon index 
we then resell the natural gas  generally for the index price  keeping the difference as our fee 
percentage of proceeds contracts under these contracts  we receive a negotiated percentage of the residue natural gas  ngls  condensate and or sulfur  recovered from gathering and processing facilities  which we then sell at market prices 
keep whole contracts under these contracts  we gather or purchase raw natural gas from the producer for processing 
a portion of the gathered or purchased gas is consumed during processing 
we extract and retain the ngls produced during processing  which we sell at market prices 
in instances when we purchase raw gas at the wellhead  we also sell for our own account  at market prices  the residue gas resulting from processing 
in those instances where we gather and process raw natural gas for the account of the producer  we must return to the producer residue gas with a british thermal unit content equivalent to the original raw gas we received 
some of these arrangements expose us to commodity price risk  which is mitigated by offsetting physical purchases and sales and the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge open positions 
in addition  we occasionally take title to natural gas and ngls for other reasons  such as to sell these products to customers 
we will continue to hedge a significant amount of this commodity price risk to support the stability of cash flows 
please read item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk for more information 
marketing our marketing segment provides supply  transmission  storage and sales services for producers and wholesale customers on our gathering  transmission and customer pipelines as well as other interconnected pipeline systems 
marketing activities are primarily undertaken to realize incremental margins on gas purchased at the wellhead  increase pipeline utilization and provide value added services to our customers 
natural gas purchased and sold by the marketing segment is priced at a published daily or monthly price index 
sales to wholesale customers typically incorporate a premium for managing their transmission and balancing requirements 
higher premiums and associated margins result from transactions that involve smaller volumes or that offer greater service flexibility for wholesale customers 
at their request  we will enter into long term fixed price purchase or sales contracts with our customers and generally will enter into offsetting hedged positions under the same or similar terms 
marketing pays third party storage facilities and pipelines for the right to store gas for various periods of time 
these contracts may be denoted as firm storage  interruptible storage  or parking and lending services 
these various contract structures are used to mitigate risk associated with sales and purchase contracts  and to take advantage of price differential opportunities 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures with respect to contingent assets and liabilities 
the basis for our estimates is historical experience  consultation with experts and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
any effect on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
we believe our critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in the following paragraphs address the more significant judgments and estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in general  we recognize revenue when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  pricing is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for our natural gas businesses  we record an estimate each month for our operating revenues and cost of natural gas based on quantities delivered  along with a true up of the prior month s estimate to equal the prior month s actual data 
as a result  there is one month of estimated data recorded in our operating revenues and cost of natural gas for each of the years ended december   and these estimates are based on the best available volume and price data 
we believe that the assumptions underlying these estimates will not be significantly different from actual amounts due to the routine nature of these estimates and the stability of our processes 
property  plant and equipment we record property  plant and equipment at its original cost and depreciate our assets over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the estimated remaining life of crude oil or natural gas production in the basins served by the pipelines 
depreciation is recorded utilizing the group method of depreciation which is commonly used by pipelines  utilities and similar entities 
determining useful life requires various assumptions to be made  including the supply of and demand for hydrocarbons in the markets served by our assets  normal wear and tear of the facilities  and the extent and frequency of maintenance programs 
changes in any of these assumptions may impact the rate at which depreciation is recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
additionally  if we determine that an asset s undepreciated cost may not be recoverable due to economic obsolescence  the business climate  legal and other factors  we evaluate the asset for impairment and record any necessary reduction in its value as a charge against earnings 
if there are changes to any of the estimates and assumptions  actual results may differ 
for example  if an average remaining service life of years had been used compared to the average remaining service life of approximately years in the results  depreciation expense would be million or million higher and net income per unit would have been or lower than levels 
if an average remaining service life of years had been used  depreciation expense would be million or million lower and net income per unit would have been or higher than levels 
we capitalize expenditures related to property  plant and equipment  subject to a minimum rule  that have a useful life greater than one year for assets purchased or constructed  existing assets that are extended  replaced or improved  or all land  regardless of cost 
acquisitions of new assets  additions  replacements and improvements other than land costing less than the minimum rules are expensed 
we categorize our capital expenditures as either core maintenance or enhancement expenditures 
core maintenance expenditures are necessary to maintain the service capability of our existing assets and include the replacement of system components and equipment that are worn  obsolete or near the end of their useful lives 
enhancement expenditures improve the service capability of the existing assets  extend asset useful lives  increase capacities from existing levels  reduce costs or enhance revenues  and enable us to respond to governmental regulations and developing industry standards 
examples of expenditures that are undertaken in response to developing industry standards include first time high resolution integrity tool runs and related comprehensive rehabilitation programs  first time pipeline pressure testing  and expenditures to install seals  liners  and other equipment to reduce risk of environmental contamination from crude oil storage tanks 
assessment of recoverability of goodwill and intangibles goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination 
goodwill is not amortized  but is tested for impairment annually as of the end of the second quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators arise that suggest the carrying value of goodwill may not be recovered 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
at the time we determine that impairment has occurred  the carrying value of the goodwill is written down to its fair value 
to estimate the fair value of the reporting units  we make estimates and judgments about future cash flows  as well as revenue  cost of sales  operating expenses  capital expenditures and net working capital based on assumptions that are consistent with our most recent five year plan  which we use to manage the business 
preparation of forecast information for use in our five year plan involves significant judgments 
actual results can  and often do  differ from the projections and assumptions we make 
these changes can have a negative impact on our estimates of impairment  which could result in charges to income 
in addition  further changes in the economic and business environment can impact our original and ongoing assessments of potential impairment 
other intangible assets consist of natural gas purchase and sale customer contracts  and natural gas supply opportunities  which we amortize on a straight line basis over the weighted average useful life of the underlying assets  which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our future cash flows 
we evaluate the carrying value of the intangible assets whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of intangibles  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the intangibles are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the intangibles  the intangibles are written down to their fair value 
if there are changes to any of our estimates and assumptions  actual results may differ 
derivative financial instruments net income and cash flows are subject to volatility from changes in market prices such as interest rates  natural gas prices  natural gas liquids prices and fractionation margins 
in order to manage the risks to our unitholders  we use a variety of derivative financial instruments to create offsetting positions to specific commodity or interest rate exposures 
under sfas no 
 all derivative financial instruments are reflected in the balance sheet at their fair value 
for those instruments that qualify for hedge accounting  the accounting treatment depends on each instrument s intended use and how it is designated 
derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting treatment which we use can be divided into two categories cashflow hedges  or fair value hedges 
cashflow hedges are entered to hedge the variability in cashflows related to a forecasted transaction 
fair value hedges are entered to hedge the value of a recognized asset or liability 
price assumptions we use to value the cash flow and fair value hedges can affect net income for each period 
we use published market price information where available  or quotations from otc market makers to find executable bids and offers 
the valuations also reflect the potential impact of liquidating our position in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under present market conditions  modeling risk  credit risk of our counterparties and operational risk 
the amounts we report in our consolidated financial statements change quarterly as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
at inception and on an ongoing basis  we also assess whether the derivatives that are used in our hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair value of the hedged item 
to the extent our cash flow hedges are determined to be highly effective  changes in the derivative fair values are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged transactions occur and are then recognized into earnings 
changes in the fair value of derivatives classified as fair value hedges are recognized in earnings as an offset to the change in fair value of the item hedged 
if the hedge is determined to not be highly effective  it can no longer be designated as a cash flow or fair value hedge and changes in the fair value are reported directly in the income statement 
our earnings are also affected by use of the mark to market method of accounting required under gaap for certain basis swap financial instruments 
we use short term  highly liquid financial instruments such as basis swaps and other contracts to economically hedge market price risks associated with inventories  firm commitments and certain anticipated transactions  primarily within our marketing segment 
as of december   certain basis swap financial instruments  however  did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
 and thus the changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded on the balance sheet and through earnings ie  using the mark to market method rather than being deferred until the firm commitment or anticipated transaction affects earnings 
the use of mark to market accounting for financial instruments may cause our non cash earnings to fluctuate based upon changes in the underlying indexes  primarily commodity prices 
the fair value of these financial instruments is determined using price data from highly liquid markets such as the nymex commodity exchange or from otc market makers 
for the year ended december   we recognized losses of million in the consolidated statement of income  as part of the cost of natural gas balance of the marketing and natural gas segments 
the fair value of the basis swaps at december   is a payable of million  and is included in the consolidated statement of financial position as part of the deferred credits balance 
these losses resulted from the negative change in market value of these basis swap hedging portfolio activities 
at that date  we had a limited number of basis swap transactions that extend beyond december  commitments  contingencies and environmental liabilities we accrue reserves for contingent liabilities  including environmental remediation and clean up costs  when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of the liabilities are based on currently available facts  existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations taking into consideration the likely effects of inflation and other factors  and include estimates of associated legal costs 
these amounts also consider prior experience to remediate contaminated sites  other companies clean up experience and data released by government organizations 
our estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new circumstances and any revisions are reflected in our earnings in the period in which they are reasonably determinable 
we evaluate recoveries from insurance coverage separately from our liability and  when recovery is reasonably assured  we record and report an asset separately from the associated liability in our financial statements 
new environmental developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws and regulations and new claims for damages to property  employees  other persons and the environment resulting from our current or past operations  could result in substantial cost and future liabilities 
we recognize liabilities for other contingencies when we have an exposure that  when fully analyzed  indicates it is both probable that an asset has been impaired or that a liability has been incurred and the amount of impairment or loss can be reasonably estimated 
both internal and external legal counsel evaluate our potential exposure to adverse outcomes 
when a range of probable loss can be estimated  we accrue the most likely amount  or at least the minimum of the range of probable loss 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates  or additional facts and circumstances cause us to review our estimates  income may be affected 
oil shortage balance and oil measurement losses oil shortage balance and oil measurement losses are inherent in the transportation of crude oil due to  among other factors  evaporation  measurement differences and blending of commodities in transit 
the estimates are based on mathematical calculations and physical measurement and include assumptions related to the type of crude oil  its market value  normal physical losses due to evaporation and capacity limitations of the system 
a material change in these assumptions may result in a change to the carrying value of our oil shortage balance or revision of our oil measurement loss estimates 
the balances are included in accounts payable and other in the consolidated statements of financial position 
operational balancing agreements and natural gas imbalances payables and receivables associated with our natural gas pipeline operational balancing agreements and natural gas imbalances are recorded monthly 
these balances are either settled on a cash basis or are carried by the pipelines and shippers on an in kind basis 
accruals associated with these in kind balances are derived from the best available third party and internal documentation and are valued on a published third party index 
if there is a change to these estimates and assumptions  actual results may differ 
results of operations the following table shows our consolidated operating revenues  expenses  operating income  net income and net income per unit 
year ended december  dollars in millions  except per unit amounts operating revenues    expenses    operating income net income net income per unit the primary reasons for the overall increases in performance  compared with  are the inclusion of results from the north texas and mid continent acquisitions 
the north texas system was purchased on december   and the mid continent system was purchased on march  the primary reason for the overall increase in performance  compared with  is the full year contribution from the midcoast assets which were acquired in october the following table reflects operating income by business segment and corporate charges 
year ended december  dollars in millions operating income liquids natural gas marketing corporate  operating and administrative total operating income corporate net income corporate consists of interest expense  interest income  minority interest  other charges and certain other operating and administrative costs such as franchise taxes  that are not allocated to the other business segments 
liquids year ended december  dollars in millions operating revenues operating and administrative power depreciation and amortization expenses operating income the following table sets forth the operating statistics for the liquids assets for the periods presented year ended december  average bpd  in thousands lakehead system united states   province of ontario total deliveries    barrel miles billions average haul miles mid continent system deliveries north dakota system deliveries year ended december  compared with year ended december  our liquids segment accounted for million of operating income  or of our consolidated operating income in this was an increase of million over liquids operating income 
the primary driver of the increase in was our newly acquired mid continent system  which contributed million of operating income to the liquids segment 
segment operating revenues increased by million in compared with  largely due to a million contribution from our mid continent system 
operating revenues from our lakehead system increased  mostly due to increased deliveries 
deliveries on our lakehead system increased during  primarily from increased production of western canadian crude oil transported on that system 
overall  production of western canadian crude oil increased in the last two years mainly due to the start up of new oil sands projects in the province of alberta 
these latest oil sands projects differ from conventional oil production in two ways 
first  oil sands deposits are a mixture of bitumen  water  sand and clay 
as a result  oil production takes the form of either mining the oil sands from subsurface deposits and separating out the water  sand and clay components  or  if the deposits are deeper  heating the reservoir sufficiently to flow the pure bitumen to the surface 
second  the bitumen requires either upgrading or blending prior to being sent to market 
the upgrading process partially refines the bitumen into a crude stream  which can be readily refined by most conventional refineries 
this product is known as synthetic crude oil 
during  crude oil production increased in western canada  primarily due to the start up of the athabasca oil sands project aosp in june the aosp is owned by shell canada limited  chevron canada limited and western oil sands lp  and consists of oil sands mining and bitumen extraction operations with a current capacity of  bpd 
deliveries on our lakehead system reflect a full year s impact from this new source of supply 
operating revenues on our north dakota system also increased in by million  primarily due to an increase in transportation of longer haul  higher margin barrels resulting from improved production in montana 
operating and administrative expenses for the liquids segment increased by million in compared with  mostly due to our new mid continent system  which had operating and administrative expenses of million 
operating and administrative expenses on our lakehead system increased by million 
this increase was attributable primarily to three factors workforce related costs increased by million due to higher pension and medical costs and other related general and administrative expenses 
oil measurement losses increased by million 
oil measurement losses occur as part of the normal operating conditions associated with our liquids pipelines 
the three types of oil measurement losses include physical losses  which occur through evaporation  shrinkage  differences in measurement between receipt and delivery locations and other operational incidents  degradation losses  which result from mixing at the interface between higher quality light crude oil and lower quality heavy crude oil in pipelines  and revaluation losses  which are a function of crude oil prices  the level of the carrier s inventory and the inventory positions of customers 
during  oil measurement losses increased due to the impact of higher crude oil prices and increased volumes on the system  which contributed to the physical losses 
also included in oil measurement losses was an adjustment to the degradation loss of approximately million 
this was the result of refinements in the oil measurement loss estimation process in valuing different types of crude on station lines 
the refinements were the result of engineering studies completed in the fourth quarter of property taxes increased million 
we have experienced a trend of increasing property taxes partially due to new facilities placed into service  and also due to increases from the taxing authority in counties and states where our pipeline assets are located 
these increases in operating and administrative expenses on the lakehead system were partially offset by lower leak remediation and repair costs of approximately million 
power costs increased million in compared with  mostly due to the growth in volumes on the lakehead system and higher mill rates attributable to higher demand and fuel costs 
power costs associated with the mid continent system were million in depreciation and amortization increased million over depreciation on the mid continent system accounted for million and the balance relates to new facilities placed into service in the liquids segment during and year ended december  compared with year ended december  our liquids segment accounted for million of operating income  or of consolidated partnership operating income in this was an increase of million over liquids operating income 
operating revenue was million higher in compared with due to higher deliveries on our lakehead and north dakota systems  partially offset by slightly lower tariffs 
overall  production of western canadian crude oil increased in over mainly due to the start up of new oil sands projects in the province of alberta 
the new aosp project contributed incremental supply beginning in july  which had a positive impact on lakehead system volumes 
on a full year basis  tariffs were lower during due to negative indexing adjustments calculated under ferc regulations and tariff reductions related to existing agreements with customers 
in february  the ferc issued an order on remand  which replaced the annual index of ppifg with an index of producers price index for finished goods ppifg without the minus one percent 
the ferc allowed the indexed levels to increase for a short period of time in to reflect the change in the index during however  effective july  the ppifg adjustment was negative 
power costs increased by million in to million from million in primarily due to the increase in deliveries on the lakehead system 
operating and administrative expenses decreased by million to million in from million in we experienced higher leak clean up and remediation costs related to two leaks in minnesota during  as well as higher workforce costs related to benefits 
these increases were offset by lower oil measurement expenses and more labor costs capitalized to construction projects 
depreciation expense was lower in by million compared with the decrease was due to revised depreciation rates effective january  on the lakehead system of million  offset by depreciation on new facilities placed into service during the fourth quarter of and throughout of million 
the reduction in depreciation rates pursuant to a third party study  better represents the expected remaining service life of the lakehead system 
natural gas our north texas system was purchased effective december   and therefore  we did not record any results of operations from this system in the results of operations for the natural gas segment include the assets purchased as part of the midcoast system since our acquisition on october  comparative results for include less than three months of operations from the midcoast system 
year ended december  dollars in millions operating revenues  cost of natural gas  operating and administrative depreciation and amortization expenses  operating income the table below indicates the average daily volumes for each of the major systems in our natural gas segment during each of the years ended december   and  in million british thermal units per day 
the full year volume data for is shown for informational purposes and includes data from the records of the previous owner  our general partner  as we did not own all of these systems for the entire year 
average mmbtu d east texas    anadarko    north texas  south texas    utos    midla    alatenn    kpc    bamagas    other major intrastates    total    east texas includes the combined systems previously referred to as east texas and northeast texas 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  our natural gas segment accounted for million of operating income  or of consolidated partnership operating income in this was an increase of million over natural gas operating income 
compared with  average daily volumes on our major natural gas systems increased in  mostly due to the contribution of our north texas system from the acquisition date of december  our north texas system contributed million to operating income in  which was consistent with our expectations for the first year of ownership 
our east texas system includes the combined results of the systems previously referred to as east texas and northeast texas 
early in  we completed projects that allowed for the operation of these assets as one integrated system  now referred to as the east texas system 
comparative results have been reclassified to conform to this presentation 
volumes on our east texas system increased by in  compared with the same period in  as a result of increased drilling by producers of gas wells in the areas served by the system 
these volume increases resulted in higher operating revenue less cost of natural gas of million compared with unit margins realized on natural gas volumes vary by location 
natural gas producers have concentrated their development efforts on regions that have a smaller incremental benefit to us than some of the natural gas volumes that the new volumes replace 
lower unit margins are attributable to various factors including the quality of the natural gas being connected to our systems and the presence of competing pipeline systems 
high natural gas prices positively impacted volumes on our gathering and processing systems 
this positive impact was compounded by favorable processing economics in the majority of our operating income is derived from fee based contracts  percentage of index or percentage of proceeds contracts 
however  a portion of our operating income is derived from keep whole processing of natural gas 
this contract structure requires us to process natural gas at times when it may not be economical to do so 
this can happen when natural gas prices are unusually high or natural gas liquids prices are unusually low 
during  natural gas prices were high but were more than offset by favorable ngl prices 
keep whole processing is mostly associated with the anadarko and east texas systems 
our keep whole processing is a relatively small but variable element of the natural gas segment s operating income 
during  operating income associated with keep whole processing was approximately million compared to million in on our east texas system  we processed  mmbtu d of natural gas in  which was an increase of compared with volumes processed in due to more favorable ngl pricing conditions in  processing activities contributed million of operating income 
this compares with million of operating income for processing activities in the increase in business activity on our east texas system has resulted in higher operating and administrative expenses of million in compared with these costs are mostly variable in nature and relate to higher workforce related costs associated with an increase in our operations staff  as well as higher overall benefit costs and an increase in repairs and maintenance expenses 
as a result  operating income on our east texas system increased million in compared to volumes on our anadarko system increased by approximately in  compared with the same period in the growth is a result of increased drilling activity in the texas panhandle and western oklahoma regions 
the higher volumes contributed to an increase of million in operating revenue less cost of natural gas 
similar to our east texas system  processing results improved on our anadarko system during due to a more favorable natural gas and ngl pricing environment 
on our anadarko system  we processed  mmbtu d of natural gas in  which was an increase of compared with volumes processed in processing activities contributed million of operating income in this compares with million of operating income for processing activities in these improvements to operating income were partially offset by higher operating and administrative expenses mostly related to variable costs associated with the increased volumes on the system 
as a result  operating income on the anadarko system increased by million in compared with the remainder of the change in operating income in the natural gas segment was due to overall decreased results on the balance of our natural gas systems 
we estimate that a per mmbtu change in keep whole processing would increase or decrease total segment operating income by approximately million 
a  mmbtu d change in gathering volume will increase or decrease operating income by approximately million 
these estimates may vary depending upon the pipeline system to which they relate  competition  other factors and are subject to variability 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  our natural gas segment accounted for million  or of consolidated operating income in this was an increase of over natural gas operating income 
our natural gas segment results of operations improved in due to the full year impact of the midcoast assets and increased volume of natural gas on the east texas system 
increased drilling activity by natural gas producers due to higher natural gas prices was a key contributor to our volume growth 
in addition  we initiated modest expansions of our facilities to handle increased customer volumes 
while high natural gas prices positively impacted volumes on our gathering and processing systems  this positive impact was largely offset by poor processing economics in the majority of our operating income is derived from fee based contracts  percentage of index or percentage of proceeds contracts 
however  a portion of our operating income is derived from keep whole processing of natural gas 
this contract structure requires us to process natural gas at times on limited volumes  when it may not be economical to do so 
this can happen when natural gas prices are unusually high or natural gas liquids prices are unusually low 
keep whole processing is mostly attributable to the anadarko and east texas systems 
our keep whole processing is a variable element of the natural gas segment s operating income 
during  operating income associated with keep whole processing was approximately million 
this compares to operating income of million for the natural gas segment as a whole 
during  high natural gas prices  particularly at the beginning of the year  adversely affected processing results 
in the second half of  processing economics improved marginally as a result of lower natural gas prices 
as levels of natural gas in storage increased through the year  natural gas prices decreased 
performance of our natural gas transmission pipelines depends largely upon revenues derived from reserved pipeline capacity 
transmission revenue is typically higher in the winter months due to increased pipeline rates and greater pipeline reservations  thus  the first and fourth quarter operating income is typically higher as compared with the second and third quarter operating income 
volumes on the utos system decreased in  as compared to the fourth quarter of this decrease is attributable to both general decline associated with volumes received into the utos system and stricter enforcement of gas quality specifications by pipelines downstream of the utos pipeline 
the full year impact to revenue in was less than million if these volumes had remained consistent with the volumes 
as anticipated  certain customer contracts on the alatenn system representing approximately of its capacity terminated during and were not renewed by the customers 
we are exploring alternative customer connections to increase the utilization of this system 
high natural gas prices have impacted the anticipated development of increased natural gas demand expected in the tennessee river valley area and are a factor in lower utilization of our bamagas system 
this system connects to two new natural gas fueled power plants owned by third parties 
bamagas earns a base return whether the system is used or not because a significant portion of its capacity is contracted on a take or pay basis 
nonetheless  increased earnings cannot be realized until the power plants or other facilities transport more natural gas than their contracted take or pay levels 
marketing our marketing segment was established upon our acquisition of the midcoast system on october   and its results of operations are included in our results since that date 
the marketing segment s results for and reflect a full year s contribution to our operating results compared with less than three months of operating results in year ended december  dollars in millions operating revenues   cost of natural gas   operating and administrative depreciation and amortization expenses   operating income year ended december  compared with year ended december  our marketing segment accounted for million of operating income  or of consolidated partnership operating income in this was a decrease of million compared with marketing operating income 
operating income in for our marketing segment included a loss of million associated with derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
we enter into financial natural gas basis swap transactions to mitigate the risk on index pricing differentials between our physical gas purchases and corresponding gas sales 
when the gas sales pricing index is different from the gas purchase pricing index  we are exposed to relative changes in those two index levels 
by entering into a basis swap between those two indices  we can effectively lock in the margin on the combined natural gas purchase and the natural gas sale  removing any market price risk on the physical transactions 
although this is a sound economic hedging strategy  these types of financial transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting under the sfas no 
guidelines 
as such  the unqualified hedges are accounted for on a mark to market basis  and the periodic change in their market value will impact the income statement 
in  the loss associated with unqualified derivatives was million 
our marketing segment was also impacted by lower unit margins on natural gas volumes purchased due to physical pipeline constraints that will remain present until our east texas system expansion is complete 
performance of the marketing segment was also negatively impacted by demand charges on new third party pipeline capacity that is utilized to transport natural gas from markets that are over supplied with natural gas in our natural gas segment to new markets 
pricing in our natural gas supply markets is expected to come under increasing pressure due to higher natural gas supplies from the rocky mountains and north texas 
for this reason we have increased our commitments on third party pipelines to provide more attractive market outlets for our natural gas supply 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  our marketing segment accounted for million of operating income  or of our consolidated operating income in this was an increase of million over marketing operating income 
colder weather during the first four months of created greater demand for natural gas  increasing the ability to optimize firm transportation contracts in competitive markets 
during  the volume of gas marketed by the marketing segment was  mmbtu d 
results for the marketing segment for the year ended december   also include the positive impact of approximately million resulting from the settlement of disputed amounts  which is included in the consolidated statement of income as a reduction of the cost of natural gas 
typically  the first and fourth quarters will result in higher operating income for the marketing segment due to colder weather in the market areas served by this segment 
colder weather generates significant incremental sales to our wholesale customers and creates the opportunity to optimize transportation and storage agreements 
corporate interest expense was million in compared with million in and million in the million increase in compared with reflects higher average borrowings  partially offset by decreases in our average borrowing rates 
the increase of million in compared with reflects higher average borrowings during due to the full year impact on interest expense of the debt assumed upon the acquisition of the midcoast system in october the increase was partially offset by lower average borrowing rates from the end of liquidity and capital resources general we believe that we will continue to have adequate liquidity to fund future recurring operating and investing activities 
our primary cash requirements consist of normal operating expenses  capital expenditures  debt service payments  distributions to partners and acquisitions of new businesses 
short term cash requirements  such as operating expenses  maintenance capital expenditures  debt service payments and quarterly distributions to partners  are expected to be funded by operating cash flows 
long term cash requirements for expansion projects and acquisitions are expected to be funded through several sources  including cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under credit facilities  i unit payment in kind distributions in lieu of cash and the issuance of additional debt and equity securities 
our ability to complete future debt and equity offerings will depend on various factors  including prevailing market conditions  interest rates and our financial condition and credit rating at the time 
on june   we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec 
under this shelf  we may offer and sell debt securities or class a common units up to a total of billion  with the amount  price and terms to be determined at the time of the sale 
we expect to use the net proceeds from any future sales of securities under the universal shelf registration statement for operations and for other general corporate purposes  including repayment or refinancing of borrowings  working capital  capital expenditures or acquisitions of businesses or assets 
we have effected the following financing transactions using our registration statement in december and january  we issued an additional million class a common units  which generated net proceeds of million  net of underwriters discounts  commissions and issuance expenses 
in addition  the general partner contributed million to maintain its general partner interest in us 
proceeds from the offering were used to reduce borrowings under our day credit facility by approximately million  to reduce borrowings under the three year term credit facility by approximately million and to fund the december  sinking fund payment of million on our first mortgage notes 
in january  we issued million in principal amount of senior notes due  from which we received net proceeds of approximately million after offering expenses 
the proceeds were used to repay a portion of the amount outstanding under our day revolving credit facility 
in september  we issued million class a common units at per unit  which generated proceeds  net of underwriters discounts  commissions and issuance expenses  of approximately million 
proceeds from this offering were used to reduce borrowings under our three year term credit facility by approximately million 
the remaining proceeds were used to fund our general operations 
in addition  the general partner contributed million to maintain its general partner interest in us 
in december  we issued million in principal amount of senior notes due in and million in principal amount of senior notes due in  from which we received net proceeds of approximately million after offering expenses 
the proceeds were used to repay a portion of the amount outstanding under our credit facility 
in february  we issued  class a common units at per unit  which generated proceeds  net of offering expenses of approximately million 
proceeds from this offering were used to repay borrowings under our three year term credit facility 
in addition  the general partner contributed million to maintain its general partner interest in us 
after giving effect to the preceding transactions  approximately million of our debt securities or class a common units are available for issuance under our existing universal shelf registration statement 
summary of obligations and commitments the following table summarizes the principal amount of our obligations and commitments at december  thereafter total dollars in millions long term debt  power and other purchase commitments other operating leases right of way product purchase obligations service contract obligations total  right of way payments are estimated to be approximately million per year for the remaining life for all pipeline systems  which has been estimated to be years for purposes of calculating the amount of future minimum commitments beyond we have long term product purchase obligations with several third party suppliers to acquire natural gas and ngls at prices approximating market at the time of delivery 
the transportation service obligations represent the minimum payment amounts for firm transportation capacity we have reserved on third party pipelines 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared with million in improved operating cash flow was the result of net income contributions from the north texas and mid continent assets  as well as improved results from our existing assets 
the remaining changes in cash from operating activities were due to changes in the operating assets and liabilities from increased natural gas prices in  an increase in natural gas and liquids inventory and general timing differences in the collection on and payment of our current accounts 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million  an increase of million from december  of this amount  million was available for cash distributions to our unitholders 
of our cash available for distribution  we retained for use in our business million from i unit holders and million from the general partner 
our fourth quarter distribution to unitholders and the general partner of million per unit  was paid on february  investing activities net cash used in our investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the prior year 
the million decrease in funds utilized in investing activities was primarily attributable to two items the dollar value of our acquisitions in was lower compared with  effectively reducing our cash outflows by million 
during  we acquired the mid continent and palo duro assets and several other smaller assets for million 
in our asset acquisitions primarily consisted of million of cash we paid for the north texas system and post closing adjustments paid to the general partner related to the midcoast acquisition of million  the decrease in our cash used for acquisitions in was offset by increased cash outflows associated with expansion and growth opportunities of existing assets during of million  as compared to the increase in property  plant and equipment is primarily due to significant amounts of construction activity during related to the east texas expansion program 
during  we spent million for capital expenditures including core maintenance and enhancement projects 
core maintenance activities  such as the replacement of equipment and planned major maintenance activities  are performed to enable our systems to operate at their maximum operating capacity 
enhancements to the systems are expected to extend the life of the systems  reduce costs or enhance revenues  and permit us to respond to developing industry and government standards and the changing service expectations of our customers 
our core maintenance capital expenditures increased to million for compared with million for  due to the expansion and growth of our existing assets 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared with million in the decrease of million from is primarily due to fewer unit offerings during and an increase in our distributions to partners in cash distributions to partners increased to million in compared with million in due to an increase in the number of units outstanding  and an increase in the general partner incentive distributions  which resulted from increased cash distributions to unitholders 
during  working capital  defined as current assets less current liabilities  improved by million to million  compared with a deficit of million at december  this improvement was primarily due to a reduction in current maturities and short term debt related to our senior credit facilities 
we amended our multi year revolving credit facility and terminated our day revolving credit facility on april  the amended facility consists of a million three year term credit facility which matures in cash distributions we distribute quarterly  to our general partner and the holders of our common units  an amount equal to our available cash  which generally is defined to mean for any calendar quarter the sum of all of our cash receipts plus net reductions to reserves less all of our cash disbursements and net changes to reserves 
these reserves are retained to provide for the proper conduct of our business  to stabilize distributions of cash to unitholders and the general partner and  as necessary  to comply with the terms of any of our agreements or obligations 
enbridge management  as the delegate of the general partner under a delegation of control agreement  computes the amount of our available cash 
enbridge management  as owner of our i units  does not receive distributions in cash 
instead  each time that we make a cash distribution to the general partner and the holders of our common units  the number of i units owned by enbridge management and the percentage of total units in us owned by enbridge management increases automatically under the provisions of the partnership agreement with the result that the number of i units owned by enbridge management will equal the number of enbridge management s shares and voting shares that are then outstanding 
the amount of this increase per i unit is determined by dividing the cash amount distributed per common unit by the average price of one of enbridge management s listed shares on the nyse for the day period immediately preceding the ex dividend date for enbridge management s shares 
for purposes of calculating the sum of all distributions of available cash  the cash equivalent amount of the additional i units that are issued when a distribution of cash is made to the general partner and owners of common units is treated as distribution of available cash  even though the i unit holder will not receive cash 
we retain the cash for use in our operations 
during  we distributed a total of  i units through quarterly distributions to enbridge management  compared with  in we retained million in related to the i unit distributions compared with million in credit facilities and debt our credit facilities and debt consist of the following december  dollars in millions short term debt day credit facility current portion of first mortgage notes total short term debt long term debt three year term credit facility first mortgage notes senior notes due or notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due unamortized discount total long term debt   loans from general partner and affiliates total debt  excluding current portion   credit facilities 
on april   we amended our unsecured multi year revolving credit facility and terminated our existing day revolving credit facility  each of which was originally entered into in january the amended facility consists of a million three year term credit facility  which matures in interest is charged on amounts drawn under this facility at a variable rate equal to the base rate or a eurodollar rate as defined in the facility agreement 
in the case of eurodollar rate loans  an additional margin is charged which varies depending on our credit rating and the amounts drawn under our credit rating 
as of december   the facility fee was 
the three year term credit facility contains restrictive covenants that required us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of times and a maximum leverage ratio of times for eighteen months until september  decreasing to times thereafter  as described in the three year term credit facility 
at december   the interest coverage ratio was approximately and the leverage ratio was approximately the three year term credit facility also places limitations on the amount of debt that may be incurred directly by our subsidiaries 
accordingly  it is expected that we will provide debt financing to our subsidiaries as required 
as of december   million was drawn on our three year term credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of first mortgage notes 
the first mortgage notes are collateralized by a first mortgage on substantially all of the property  plant and equipment of the lakehead partnership and are due and payable in equal annual installments of million until their maturity in the notes contain various restrictive covenants applicable to us  and restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  including compliance with certain debt issuance tests 
we believe these issuance tests will not negatively impact our ability to finance future expansion projects 
under the first mortgage note agreements  we cannot make cash distributions more frequently than quarterly in an amount not to exceed available cash for the immediately preceding calendar quarter 
if we repay the notes prior to their stated maturities  the first mortgage note agreements provide for the payment of a redemption premium by us 
senior notes 
during the years ended december  and  we made senior note issuances in january and december and may these fixed rate notes are our unsecured obligations  ranked equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness  and effectively junior in right of payment to any secured indebtedness that we may have and to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries  which own all of our operating assets 
we conduct substantially all of our business through our subsidiaries 
the senior notes are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities  including trade payables  of our subsidiaries 
as of december  and  our subsidiaries had approximately million and million  respectively  of indebtedness to unaffiliated third parties 
the borrowings under these notes are non recourse to our general partner and enbridge management 
we have guaranteed repayment of amounts due under these notes through an unsecured and unsubordinated guarantee 
these notes are subject to make whole redemption rights and were issued under an indenture containing certain covenants 
these covenants restrict our ability  with certain exceptions  to sell  convey  transfer  lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets to any person  except in accordance with our agreement 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  in december  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due and million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due in a public offering  from which we received net proceeds of million 
we used the proceeds to repay a portion of our outstanding debt under bank credit facilities 
in january  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due in a public offering  from which we received net proceeds of million 
we used the proceeds to repay a portion of our outstanding debt under bank credit facilities 
in may  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due and million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due in a private placement 
we used the proceeds of approximately million  net of expenses of approximately million  to repay loans from our affiliates and other bank debt 
we recorded a discount of million in connection with the issuance of the senior notes 
all of the senior notes pay interest semi annually and have varying maturities and terms as previously outlined in the table above 
the senior unsecured notes do not contain any covenants restricting the issuance of additional indebtedness 
loans from general partner and affiliates 
as of december  and  we had and million  respectively  in debt outstanding under a note to an affiliate of the general partner 
this note relates to debt we assumed in connection with the acquisition of the midcoast system in october the note matures in and has cross default provisions that are triggered by events of default under our first mortgage notes or defaults under our three year term credit facility 
the note is subordinate to our three year term credit facility and other senior indebtedness 
for the years ended december  and  we converted interest payable related to the loans from the general partner and affiliates in the amount of million and million  respectively  into long term debt to the general partner and affiliates 
credit ratings in october  standard and poors lowered our corporate rating from bbb negative outlook to bbb stable outlook and the corporate credit rating of enbridge energy  limited partnership  our wholly owned subsidiary  from bbb negative outlook to bbb stable outlook 
standard and poors also lowered the senior unsecured debt rating of enbridge energy  limited partnership from bbb to bbb and lowered the first mortgage notes rating of enbridge energy  limited partnership from a to bbb 
however  standard poors left unchanged at bbb its senior unsecured debt rating for that subsidiary 
management does not expect standard and poors rating actions to have a material impact on the financing capability 
our senior unsecured debt is rated bbb and baa by dominion bond rating service and moody s  respectively 
moody s also rates the senior unsecured debt of enbridge energy  limited partnership at baa off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
cash requirements for future growth acquisitions 
our primary strategy is to grow cash distributions through the profitable expansion of our existing assets and through development and acquisition of complementary businesses with risk profiles similar to our current businesses 
we will continue to analyze potential acquisitions  with a focus on crude oil  refined products and natural gas pipelines  terminals and related facilities 
major energy companies have sold their non strategic assets in recent years  continuing the trend of rationalization of the energy infrastructure in the united states 
we expect this trend to continue and believe we are well positioned to participate in these opportunities 
we will seek opportunities throughout the united states  particularly in the us gulf coast area  where asset acquisitions are anticipated in and around our existing natural gas business 
we expect that the funds needed to achieve growth through acquisitions will be obtained through a combination of cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under bank credit facilities  i unit payment in kind distributions in lieu of cash and the issuance of additional debt and equity securities 
distributions 
for the years ended december  and  the declared annual distribution rate was per unit 
we expect that all cash distributions will be paid out of operating cash flows over the long term  however  from time to time  we may temporarily borrow under our credit facilities for the purpose of paying cash distributions until the full impact of operations is realized 
capital spending 
at december   we had million in estimated outstanding purchase commitments attributable to capital projects for the construction of assets that will be recorded as property  plant and equipment during expenditures related to property  plant and equipment are capitalized capital expenditures  subject to a minimum rule  that have a useful life greater than one year for assets purchased or constructed  existing assets that are extended  replaced  or improved  or all land  regardless of cost 
acquisitions of new assets  additions  replacements and improvements other than land costing less than the established minimum rules are expensed accordingly 
we categorize our capital expenditures as either core maintenance or enhancement expenditures 
core maintenance expenditures are those expenditures that are necessary to maintain the service capability of the existing assets and includes the replacement of system components and equipment which is worn  obsolete or completing its useful life 
enhancement expenditures improve the service capability of the existing assets  extend asset useful lives  increase capacities from existing levels  reduce costs or enhance revenues  and enable us to respond to governmental regulations and developing industry standards 
in  we anticipate our capital expenditures to approximate dollars in millions system enhancements core maintenance activities lakehead system expansion projects east texas expansion excluding major expansion projects and acquisitions  ongoing capital expenditures are expected to average approximately million annually approximately for core maintenance and for system enhancements 
we anticipate funding the expenditures temporarily through our bank credit facilities  the commercial paper program we expect to establish during the first quarter of  or with permanent debt and equity funding being provided when appropriate 
core maintenance expenditures are expected to be funded by operating cash flows 
we expect to incur continuing annual capital and operating expenditures for pipeline integrity measures to ensure both regulatory compliance and to maintain the overall integrity of our pipeline systems 
expenditure levels have continued to increase as pipelines age and require higher levels of inspection or maintenance  however  these are viewed to be consistent with industry trends 
subsequent events cash distribution on january   our board of directors declared a distribution payable on february   to our unitholders of record as of february   of our available cash of million at december   or per common unit 
of this distribution  million was paid in cash  million was distributed in i units to holders of our i units and million was retained from the general partner in respect of this i unit distribution 
acquisition on november   we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire natural gas gathering and processing assets in north texas for approximately million in cash  excluding normal closing adjustments 
the asset purchase closed with an effective date of january  we funded the acquisition with borrowings under our existing credit facilities 
the assets purchased primarily serve areas of the fort worth basin  which are mature  but experiencing minimal production decline rates 
the assets include approximately  miles of gas gathering pipelines and four processing plants with aggregate processing capacity of million cubic feet of natural gas per day 
the system provides cash flow primarily from purchasing raw natural gas from producers at the wellhead  processing the gas and then selling the natural gas liquids and residue gas streams 
the assets will be included in our natural gas segment and will become part of our north texas system 
the purchase price was allocated entirely to the fixed assets purchased  and there was no goodwill recorded 
class a common unit issuance in february  we issued  million class a common units at per unit  which generated proceeds  net of offering expenses  of approximately million 
in addition  the general partner contributed million to the partnership to maintain its general partner interest in the partnership 
proceeds from this offering were used to repay borrowings under our three year term credit facility 
commercial paper program during the first quarter of  we plan to establish a million commercial paper program to be backstopped by our million three year term credit facility 
we expect to reduce our short term borrowing costs by borrowing in the commercial paper market and repaying all outstanding balances under our million three year term credit facility 
our three year term credit facility will remain undrawn and available to backstop our commercial paper program 
the commercial paper program will not contain any clauses or ratings triggers that would restrict borrowing under the facility 
the covenants include a x maximum debt ebitda x after september leverage test and x ebitda interest coverage test 
we have received credit ratings of a and p by standard and poor s and moody s  respectively  on our commercial paper program 
future prospects liquids average daily crude oil deliveries on our lakehead system are expected to decrease by approximately  bpd during  from million bpd in to approximately million bpd in the decrease is attributable to the early january fire at the suncor oil sands plant in alberta 
suncor estimates a full recovery by third quarter  resulting in a substantial increase in deliveries on our lakehead system occurring in late future prospects for our lakehead system depend upon increased crude oil production from western canada 
while conventional oil supplies in this area are declining  crude oil production from canada s oil sands supply is increasing 
estimated recoverable crude oil reserves from the oil sands  using existing technology  represent only of the volume in place of approximately trillion barrels 
to put this in perspective  this total volume in western canada exceeds the proved reserves of saudi arabia 
therefore  this resource is expected to be an important source of crude oil supply for north america in the coming decades 
recognizing this  a number of major oil companies have announced and or undertaken projects requiring investments of approximately billion over the next decade 
this level of investment is expected to increase production of crude oil and enhance utilization of the capacity available on our lakehead system 
several major oil sands projects are scheduled for completion over the next few years  including expansions of existing oil sands projects  as well as new projects 
the two original oil sands producers  suncor and syncrude  are both constructing projects to increase production by the end of by approximately  bpd of additional supply 
in addition to the alberta oil sands  canada has substantial conventional crude oil resources 
conventional crude oil production will remain sensitive to the price of crude oil and the level of crude oil drilling activity 
for a complete discussion of supply and demand for crude oil  please see items business and properties 
we and enbridge recognize the need to expand beyond the lakehead system s traditional markets  therefore  we have undertaken an oil sands market study to research supply and disposition of crude oil 
the findings indicate that there is demand among us refiners who have not previously had access to canadian crude oil due to a lack of pipeline infrastructure or economic tariffs 
together  we and enbridge are focusing on developing transportation solutions to allow padd ii refineries  and ultimately  refiners on the us gulf coast  to gain increased or new access to western canadian crude oil production 
two tangible steps have already been announced under this initiative 
first  enbridge acquired a stake in a pipeline that runs from cushing  oklahoma to chicago and intends to reverse its flow 
the pipeline will be renamed the spearhead pipeline and will provide capacity to deliver  bpd into the major oil hub at cushing by this line could subsequently be expanded to accommodate up to  bpd 
we expect to benefit following the reversal  as western canadian crude oil will be carried on the lakehead system as far as chicago  and then transferred to the spearhead pipeline 
the second step was our proposal to capp of a multi phase expansion of the lakehead system 
the first two phases would expand capacities between superior  wisconsin and chicago  illinois 
in total  these first two phases would provide an additional  bpd of capacity at an estimated cost of million 
the last two phases would continue to expand our lakehead system to chicago  but would also reach new markets 
the third phase would cost about million and would provide incremental capacity of  bpd into the chicago area 
the final phase would then extend this pipeline further south to either wood river or patoka  illinois to provide capacity for further canadian crude movements to the new markets being served from these hubs 
natural gas our natural gas assets are located in the gulf coast and mid continent regions of the united states  two of the premier natural gas producing areas of the united states 
as a result  there are many opportunities to connect new natural gas supplies either by installing new facilities or acquiring adjacent third party gathering operations 
consolidation with neighboring facilities will extract efficiencies by eliminating costs  for example  by combining redundant facilities  increasing volume  and increasing processing margins 
these opportunities tend to involve modest amounts of capital with attractive rates of return 
results of our natural gas gathering and processing business depend upon the drilling activities of natural gas producers in the areas we serve 
during  increased drilling in the areas where our gathering systems are located has generally exceeded the national trend 
one of the prominent areas in which this occurred was the barnett shale formation in north texas  where natural gas production increased from mmcf d in to  mmcf d in late the barnett shale formation is a prominent new natural gas development within the fort worth basin  not previously accessed by our system 
to address this opportunity  we acquired the north texas system in a transaction that closed on december  the acquired facilities provide approximately mmcf d of processing capacity 
the barnett shale is being actively developed  and we anticipate that throughput on the north texas system will increase modestly in each of the next several years 
we are constructing a new mmcf d intrastate transmission pipeline to carry increased volumes of natural gas to the pipeline hub at carthage  texas 
carthage access is important to natural gas shippers because it offers a number of connections to interstate pipelines  which tend to support more favorable margins to producers 
we expect to bring the system on line in mid and are evaluating other projects that further integrate all our major texas centered pipeline systems 
growth by acquisitions acquisitions are expected to play a role in the achievement of our goals in in general  these acquisitions are expected to be in or near areas where we already operate and will present the best opportunities for consolidation savings and enhancement of our market position 
we also will evaluate more significant acquisitions 
subject to financing capability  enbridge plans to use us as its primary vehicle for acquiring mature energy delivery assets  particularly in the gulf coast region of the united states 
we could make acquisitions directly from enbridge or its subsidiaries in the future and will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions from unaffiliated parties 
growth in cash distributions we have modestly grown our cash distributions over the last several years and our distribution coverage has been less than our stated target of x distributable cash flow 
cash distributions coverage would likely have been greater were it not for lower utilization of the lakehead system expansions than anticipated when we committed to the expansions in the late s 
increased utilization of the lakehead system  including the approximately million terrace expansion program  is fundamental to increasing cash distributions above the current per unit  per year 
it is anticipated that oil sands developments will provide increased utilization of the lakehead system in the near future 
it is also anticipated that oil sands development will support further expansions that will grow our earnings and cash flow 
selected acquisitions and growth of the natural gas segments are also expected to contribute to improved near term performance 
regulatory matters rate refunds on october   the ferc issued an order on remand remand order relating to initial rates on our kansas pipeline system kpc for the period of time between december and november we acquired kpc on october  the remand order was issued in response to a united states court of appeals ruling in august requiring the ferc to address the issue of appropriate rate refunds  if any  with respect to kpc s initial rates 
in the remand order  the ferc found that the proper initial rates are lower than the rates previously charged to customers pending resolution of this contested rate case 
in accordance with the ferc s findings  any difference between what was collected and these revised initial section rates for the period of time between december and november  plus interest compounded quarterly  is subject to refund 
refunds to our customers were made in january pursuant to a refund plan agreed upon with customers and approved by the ferc 
our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december   include a charge of approximately million for the rate refunds and interest 
the rate refunds relate almost entirely to a time period prior to our ownership of kpc 
recent accounting developments in march  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 participating securities and the two class method under financial accounting standards board statement no 
earnings per share eitf  which addresses a number of questions regarding the computation of earnings per share by companies that have issued securities other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to participate in dividends and earnings of the company when  and if  it declares dividends on its common stock 
the issue also provides further guidance in applying the two class method of calculating earnings per share  clarifying what constitutes a participating security and how to apply the two class method of computing earnings per share once it is determined that a security is participating  including how to allocate undistributed earnings to such a security 
eitf was effective for fiscal periods beginning after march  the adoption of eitf did not result in a change in our calculation of earnings per unit for any of the periods presented because we had no undistributed net earnings 
a number of accounting standards  interpretations  emerging issues task force eitf issues  fasb staff positions fsp  statements of position sop  etc 
have been proposed by the various standard setting authorities in the united states of america  but have not been finalized 
we routinely monitor the activities of standard setting authorities and evaluate the effect the proposed guidance may have on our consolidated financial statements 
eitf issue  accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty represents a recent proposal regarding how purchases and sales of inventory between entities in the same line of business that are deemed nonmonetary transactions within the scope of apb are to be recorded 
we do not have transactions that fall within the scope of this proposed eitf issue 
however  we cannot determine what  if any  effect a final consensus on this issue may have on our consolidated financial statements due to the preliminary nature of the proposal 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and foreign exchange risk to the extent the amounts drawn under our credit facilities carry floating rates of interest  our earnings and cash flows are exposed to changes in interest rates 
this exposure is managed through periodically refinancing floating rate bank debt with long term fixed rate debt and through the use of interest rate risk management hedge contracts 
we do not have any material exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates as virtually all of our revenues and expenses are denominated in us dollars 
to the extent that a material foreign exchange exposure arises  we intend to hedge such exposure using forward or other financial derivative contracts 
the table below summarizes  as of december   our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps and debt obligations 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest paid rates by expected contractual maturity dates

however  we have commodity risk related to degradation losses associated with fluctuating differentials between the price of heavy crude oil relative to light crude oil 
commodity prices have a significant impact on the underlying supply of  and demand for  crude oil and ngls that we transport 
a portion of our earnings and cash flows in our natural gas segments are exposed to movements in the prices of natural gas and ngls 
we have entered into hedge transactions to substantially mitigate exposure to movements in these prices 
pursuant to policies approved by the board of directors of the general partner  we may not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
natural gas we enter into natural gas derivative transactions in order to hedge the forecasted purchases or sales of natural gas 
the following table details the outstanding derivatives at december  and fair value system maturity dates notional mmbtu dollars in millions east texas system  north texas system  midcoast system  marketing  some of our natural gas derivative transactions  which mitigate economic exposures arising from underlying natural gas purchases and sales  do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
as such  the change in fair market value of these derivative instruments is booked to the income statement 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded losses of million and million  respectively  in the consolidated statements of income as part of the cost of natural gas expense  to account for changes in the fair value 
natural gas liquids we enter into ngl derivative transactions to hedge the forecasted sales of ngls
