geographic information the company operates within one industry segment  menhaden fishing  for the production and sale of fish meal  fish solubles and fish oil 
export sales of fish oil and fish meal were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
such sales were made primarily to the mexican  european and canadian markets 
in  and  sales to one customer were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
this customer differed from year to year 
the following table shows the geographical distribution of revenues in thousands based on location of customers years ended december  revenues percent revenues percent revenues percent us mexico europe canada asia south central america other total company overview omega is the nation s largest producer of protein rich fish meal and oil 
the company s products are produced from menhaden a herring like fish found in commercial quantities  and includes regular grade and value added specialty fish meals  crude and refined fish oils and fish solubles 
fishing 
during  the company owned a fleet of fishing vessels and spotter aircraft for use in its fishing operations and also leased additional aircraft where necessary to facilitate operations 
during the fishing season in the gulf of mexico  which runs from mid april through october  the company operated fishing vessels and spotter aircraft 
the fishing area in the gulf is generally located along the gulf coast  with a concentration off the louisiana and mississippi coasts 
the fishing season along the atlantic coast begins in early may and usually extends into december 
in  the company operated fishing vessels and spotter aircraft along the mid atlantic coast  concentrated primarily in and around virginia and north carolina 
the remaining fleet of fishing vessels and spotter aircraft are not routinely operated during the fishing season and are back up to the active fleet  used for other transportation purposes  inactive or in the process of refurbishment in the company s shipyard 
menhaden usually school in large  tight clusters and are commonly found in warm  shallow waters 
spotter aircraft locate the schools and direct the fishing vessels to them 
the principal fishing vessels transport two foot purse boats  each carrying several fishermen and one end of a  foot net 
the purse boats encircle the school and capture the fish in the net 
the fish are then pumped from the net into refrigerated holds of the fishing vessel or onto a carry vessel  and then are unloaded at the company s processing plants 
meal and oil processing plants 
during  the company operated four meal and oil processing plants  two in louisiana  one in mississippi and one in virginia  where the menhaden are processed into three general products types fish meal  fish oil and fish solubles 
as of december   the company s four active processing plants had an aggregate annual capacity to process approximately  tons of fish 
the company s processing plants are located in coastal areas near the company s fishing fleet 
annual volume processed varies depending upon menhaden catch and demand 
each plant maintains a dedicated dock to unload fish  fish processing equipment and storage capacity 
the fish are unloaded from the fishing vessels into storage boxes and then conveyed into steam cookers 
the fish are then passed through presses to remove most of the oil and water 
the solid portions of the fish are dried and ground into fish meal 
the liquid that is produced in the cooking and pressing operations contains oil  water  dissolved protein and some fish solids 
this liquid is decanted to remove the solids and is put through a centrifugal oil and water separation process 
the separated fish oil is a finished product called crude oil 
the separated water and protein mixture is further processed through evaporators to recover the soluble protein  which can be sold as a finished product or added to the solid portions of the fish for processing into fish meal 
health and science center 
in october  the company completed construction and commenced operation of a new health and science center that provides metric tons per day fish oil processing capacity 
the new center is located adjacent to the company s reedville  virginia processing plant 
the food grade facility includes state of the art processing equipment and controls that will allow the company to refine  bleach  winterize and deodorize its menhaden fish oil and has more than tripled the company s previous refined fish oil production capacity 
the facility also provides the company with automated packaging and refrigerated on site storage capacity and has a new fully equipped lipids laboratory to enhance the development of omega oils and food products 
products 
the company sells three general types of products fish meal  fish oil and fish solubles 
fish meal 
fish meal  the principal product made from menhaden  is sold primarily as a high protein feed ingredient 
it is used as a protein supplement in feed formulated for pigs and other livestock  aquaculture and household pets 
each use requires certain standards to be met regarding quality and protein content  which are determined by the freshness of the fish and by processing conditions such as speed and temperatures 
the company produces fish meal of several different types special select 
special select is a premium grade low temperature processed fish meal 
the quality control guidelines are very stringent  producing a higher protein level and higher digestibility and a lower total volatile nitrogen tvn and histamine count 
these guidelines require that only the freshest fish and the most gentle drying process be used 
special select is targeted for monogastrics  including baby pigs  turkey poults  pets  shrimp and trout 
sealac 
sealac is similar to special select in its freshness low tvn and gentle drying high digestibility 
during the processing however  the company removes most of the soluble protein 
this step allows the amount of rumen undegradable protein to be maximized while still maintaining excellent digestibility 
this product is made specifically for dairy and beef cattle  sheep  goats and other ruminants requiring bypass protein 
faq meal 
faq fair average quality meal  the company s commodity grade fish meal  guarantees a protein content of at least 
this product typically is used in protein blends for poultry  catfish  pets and other animals 
fish oil 
the company produces crude unrefined fish oil  refined fish oil and food grade oils 
unrefined fish oil 
unrefined fish oil also referred to as crude fish oil is the company s basic fish oil product 
this grade of fish oil has not undergone any portion of the refining process 
the company s markets for crude fish oil have changed over the past decade 
in the early s  the company s main crude fish oil market  which accounted for greater than of the company s production  was utilized by manufacturers of hydrogenated oils for human consumption such as margarine and shortening 
in  the company estimates that approximately of its crude fish oil was sold as a feed ingredient to the aquaculture industry 
the growth of the worldwide aquaculture industry has resulted in increasing demand for fish oils in order to improve feed efficiency  nutritional value  survivability and health of farm raised fish species 
refined fish oil 
the company s refined fish oils come in three basic grades and also includes crude fish oils of special quality or that may require custom packaging or special additives 
feed grade oils 
feed grade menhaden oil is processed and refined to offer a high omega oil for use in premium pet  aquaculture and livestock feeds  as well as agricultural and attractant applications 
the processing reduces oxidation while enhancing omega fatty acids for incorporation in the final feed to enhance skin and coat conditioning  reproductive performance  and increasing immunity 
both kosher and organic products are available 
seacide tm 
one new product that the company has developed from refined fish oil is seacide tm 
seacide tm is a unique blend of refined menhaden oil  cottonseed oil and an organic emulsifier developed for use against target pests and diseases that occur in a variety of field crops  orchards  vineyards and greenhouse operations 
seacide tm is an all natural organic alternative to chemical insecticides and fungicides  is less phytotoxic than petroleum based oils  is compatible with most fertilizers  and is versatile enough for use on virtually any crop 
food grade oils 
the company has developed a patented process to fully refine menhaden oil to remove flavor  odor  color and pro oxidants and offer a naturally high  long chain omega content 
the company s main product in this grade is omegapure 
food applications for omegapure are designed to deliver a stable  odorless  flavorless source of omega fatty acids to enhance human nutrition 
these applications include mainstream consumer foods  medical care foods and dietary supplements 
omegapure is also kosher certified and organic 
omega fatty acids exist in two forms long chain and short chain 
short chain omega s or alpha linolenic acid ala  are generally found in canola oil  soy beans and flaxseed  and generally require five to ten times as much concentration to approach the same benefit levels as long chain omega s 
long chain omega fatty acids are generally found in marine sources and consist of two main types eicosapentaenoic acid epa and docosahexaenic acid dha 
epa is a fatty acid that generally reduces inflammatory responses and has been linked to the alleviation of symptoms from asthma  arthritis  psoriasis and other inflammatory conditions 
dha is a major structural fatty acid in the brain and the eye s retina 
dha is important for proper brain and eye development in infants and has been shown to support cardiovascular health in adults 
various scientific studies have linked consumption of omega fatty acids to a number of nutritional and health benefits  such as heart health  treatment of arthritis and other inflammatory diseases  improving brain and eye function and treatment of depression 
for example  in september  the us food and drug administration fda announced that scientific evidence indicates that long chain omega fatty acids may be beneficial in reducing coronary heart disease 
in addition the american heart association aha issued a scientific statement in november  entitled fish consumption  fish oil  omega fatty acids  and cardiovascular disease 
the scientific statement outlines the findings of a comprehensive report that examined the cardiovascular health benefit of omega fatty acids from fish sources  specifically dha and epa 
the report concluded that consumption of such omega fatty acids  either through diet or supplements  may reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease 
the statement referred to studies that have indicated the following to be associated with the intake of omega fatty acids decreased risk of sudden death and arrhythmia  decreased thrombosis blood clot  decreased triglyceride levels  decreased growth of atherosclerotic plaque  improved arterial health and lower blood pressure 
the scientific statement concludes that omega fatty acids have been shown in epidemiological and clinical trials to reduce the incidence of heart disease 
menhaden oil currently is the only marine source of long chain omega s directly affirmed by the fda as a generally recognized as safe or gras food ingredient for direct human consumption 
the fda has approved menhaden oil use in different food categories such as margarine  salad dressings  condiments  yogurt  ice cream  cheese  prepared meats  sauces  soups  crackers  cookies  cereals and bakery products 
in february  the fda posted for public comment a proposed regulation that would add additional food categories to the list already approved for the inclusion of rich menhaden oil 
in january  the fda published a tentative final rule for public comment which would increase to the number of food categories approved for inclusion of menhaden oil  subject to the condition that menhaden oil is not used in combination with other oils that are a significant source of epa and dha 
several additional developments have occurred in and early that the company believes could potentially benefit its sales efforts for omegapure 
in september  the fda announced that scientific evidence indicates that long chain omega fatty acids containing both epa and dha may be beneficial in reducing coronary heart disease 
the company believes that this new qualified health claim should encourage consumers to look for foods and beverages that contain long chain omega s 
in september  the company entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with national starch and chemical company  a leading producer of innovative starch based ingredients for the global food industry that sells to over  food manufacturers 
omega protein is the exclusive provider for of national starch s requirements for long chain omega fish oil 
national starch will encapsulate omegapure into a free flowing dry powder called novomega  which will then be marketed to national starch s worldwide customer base 
omega protein has also granted national starch a license to use its omegapure trademark in connection with the packaging of national starch s products 
in october  the company completed its health and science center in reedville  virginia 
the company is the only fully integrated fish oil processing operation in the united states that both directly conducts fishing operations and also manufactures highly refined epa and dha from these marine resources 
with the completion of this new facility  the company can control the purity and quality of its product from harvesting all the way through manufacturing and shipment 
in january  the us department of agriculture and the department of health and human services released the dietary guidelines for americans 
the guidelines  which are issued every five years  represent the federal government s most current science based advice to promote human health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases through nutrition and physical activity 
the previous dietary guidelines issued in recognized that certain fish contain omega fatty acids that are being studied to determine if they offer protection against heart disease  but did not specifically identify these omega fatty acids as dha and epa 
the dietary guidelines specifically mentioned dha and epa and stated the limited evidence suggests an association between consumption of fatty acids in fish and reduced risks of mortality from cardiovascular disease for the general population 
industrial grade oils 
industrial grade menhaden oil is refined and processed to enhance the unique fatty acid range  making it desirable for a number of drying and lubricating applications including coolant transfer  chemical raw material  drying and rustproofing paints  drilling fluids and leather treatment chemicals 
fish solubles 
fish solubles are a liquid protein product used as an additive in fish meal and are also marketed as an independent product to animal feed formulators and the fertilizer industry 
the company s soluble based products are neptune fish concentrate 
this aqua grade liquid protein is composed of low molecular weight  water soluble compounds such as free amino acids  peptides and nucleotides that are attractants for a variety of aquaculture feeds 
the product is utilized in both shrimp and finfish diets to improve attractability and thus consumption and conversion 
neptune fish concentrate also can be added directly to grow out ponds as a fertilizer to help feed plankton and other natural food sources 
omegagrow 
omegagrow is a liquid soil or foliar applied fertilizer for plant nutrition 
omegagrow is approved for organic uses by the organic materials review institute omri 
omegagrow is a free flowing product that has been filtered through an mesh screen and can be applied by sprayers or through irrigation systems 
omegagrow plus 
omegagrow plus is a liquid foliar applied fertilizer for plant nutrition that also helps to control insect and fungus problems 
this product has additional oil content of to which is greater than the to oil content typically found in omegagrow 
these higher levels are detrimental to soft bodied insects  as well as fungal diseases in citrus and vegetable crops 
omegagrow plus can be used as a replacement for petroleum based oil sprays 
distribution system 
the company s distribution system of warehouses  tank storage facilities  vessel loading facilities  trucks  barges and railcars allows the company to service customers throughout the united states and also foreign locations 
the company owns and leases warehouses and tank storage space for storage of its products  generally at terminals along the mississippi river and tennessee river 
see properties 
the company generally contracts with third party trucking  vessel  barge and railcar companies to transport its products to and from warehouses and tank storage facilities and directly to its customers 
historically  approximately to of omega s faq grade fish meal was sold on a two to twelve month forward contract basis 
the balance of faq grade fish meal and other products was substantially sold on a spot basis through purchase orders 
in  the company began a similar forward sales program for its specialty grade meals and crude fish oil due to increasing demand for these products 
during  approximately of the company s specialty meals and crude fish oil had been sold on a forward contract basis 
in  approximately of the company s specialty meals and crude oil had been sold on a forward contract basis 
the company s annual revenues are highly dependent on both annual fish catch and inventories and  in addition  inventory is generally carried over from one year to the next year 
the company determines the level of inventory to be carried over based on prevailing market prices of the products  and sales volumes that will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year 
the company s fish meal products have a useable life of approximately one year from date of production  however  the company typically attempts to empty its warehouses of the previous season s meal products by the second or third month of the new fishing season 
the company s crude fish oil products do not lose efficacy unless exposed to oxygen and  therefore  their storage life typically is longer than that of fish meal 
customers and marketing 
most of the company s marine protein products are sold directly to about customers by the company s marketing department  while a smaller amount is sold through independent sales agents 
product inventory was million as of december  versus million on december  the company s fish meal is sold primarily to domestic feed producers for utilization as a high protein ingredient for the swine  aquaculture  dairy and pet food industries 
fish oil sales primarily involve export markets where the fish oil is used for aquaculture feeds and is refined for use as a hydrogenated edible oil 
the company s products are sold both in the us and internationally 
international sales consist mainly of fish oil sales to norway  canada  china  chile and mexico 
the company s sales in these foreign markets are denominated in us dollars and not directly affected by currency fluctuations 
such sales could be adversely affected by changes in demand resulting from fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
a number of countries in which the company currently sells products impose various tariffs and duties  none of which have a significant impact on the company s foreign sales 
certain of these duties are being reduced annually for certain countries under the north american free trade agreement and the uruguay round agreement of the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
in all cases  the company s products are shipped to its customers either by fob shipping point or cif terms  and therefore  the customer is responsible for any tariffs  duties or other levies imposed on the company s products sold into these markets 
during the off season  the company fills purchase orders from the inventory it has accumulated during the fishing season or in some cases  by re selling meal purchased from other suppliers 
prices for the company s products tend to be lower during the fishing season when product is more abundant than in the off season 
throughout the entire year  prices are often significantly influenced by supply and demand in world markets for competing products  primarily other global sources of fish meal and oil  and also soybean meal for its fish meal products  and vegetable oils for its fish oil products when used as an alternative to vegetable oils 
quality control 
the company believes that maintaining high standards of quality in all aspects of its manufacturing operations play an important part in its ability to attract and retain customers and maintain its competitive position 
to that end  the company has adopted strict quality control systems and procedures designed to test the quality aspects of its products  such as protein content and digestibility 
the company regularly reviews  updates and modifies these systems and procedures as appropriate 
purchases and sales of third party meal and oils 
omega has from time to time purchased fish meal and fish oil from other domestic and international manufacturers 
these purchase and resale transactions have been ancillary to the company s base manufacturing and sales business 
part of the company s business plan involves expanding its purchase and resale of other manufacturers fish meal and fish oil products 
in  the company initially focused on the purchase and resale of mexican fish meal and fish oil and revenues generated from these types of transactions in that year represented less than of total company revenues 
during and  the company s fish catch and resultant product inventories were reduced  primarily due to adverse weather conditions  and the company further expanded its purchase and resales of other fish meals and oils primarily panamanian  peruvian and mexican fish meal and us menhaden oil 
although operating margins from these activities are less than the margins typically generated from the company s base domestic production  these operations provide the company with a source of fish meal and oil to sell into other markets where the company has not historically had a presence 
during  the company purchased products totaling approximately  tons  or approximately of total volume sales 
during  the company purchased products totaling approximately  tons  or approximately of total volume sales 
insurance 
the company maintains insurance against physical loss and damage to its assets  coverage against liabilities to third parties it may incur in the course of its operations  as well as workers compensation  united states longshoremen s and harbor workers compensation act and jones act coverage 
assets are insured at replacement cost  market value or assessed earning power 
the company s limits for liability coverage are statutory or million 
the million limit is comprised of several excess liability policies  which are subject to deductibles  underlying limits and exclusions 
the company believes its insurance coverage to be in such form  against such risks  for such amounts and subject to such deductibles and self retentions as are prudent and normal for its operations 
the company has elected to increase its deductibles and self retentions in order to achieve lower insurance premium costs 
these higher deductibles and self retentions will expose the company to greater risk of loss if claims occur 
competition 
the marine protein and oil business is subject to significant competition from producers of vegetable and other animal protein products and oil products such as archer daniels midland and cargill 
in addition  but to a lesser extent  the company competes with smaller domestic privately owned menhaden fishing companies and international marine protein and oil producers  including scandinavian herring processors and south american anchovy processors 
many of these competitors have significantly greater financial resources and more extensive and diversified operations than the company 
omega competes on price  quality and performance characteristics of its products  such as protein level and amino acid profile in the case of fish meal 
the principal competition for the company s fish meal and fish solubles is from other global production of marine proteins as well as other protein sources such as soybean meal and other vegetable or animal protein products 
the company believes  however  that these other non marine sources are not complete substitutes because fish meal offers nutritional values not contained in such other sources 
other globally produced fish oils provide the primary market competition for the company s fish oil  as well as soybean and palm oil  from time to time 
fish meal prices have historically borne a relationship to prevailing soybean meal prices  while prices for fish oil are generally influenced by prices for vegetable fats and oils  such as soybean and palm oils 
thus  the prices for the company s products are established by worldwide supply and demand relationships over which the company has no control and tend to fluctuate significantly over the course of a year and from year to year 
regulation 
the company s operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the locations and periods in which fishing may be conducted as well as environmental and safety matters 
at the state and local level  certain state and local government agencies have either enacted legislation or regulations which prohibits  restricts or regulates menhaden fishing within their jurisdictional waters 
the company s menhaden fishing operations are also subject to regulation by two interstate compacts created by federal law the atlantic states marine fisheries commission asmfc which consists of states along the atlantic coast  and the gulf states marine fisheries commission which consists of states along the gulf of mexico 
on february   the menhaden management board of the asmfc voted to initiate the preparation of an addendum to the existing asmfc interstate management plan for atlantic menhaden which would limit the amount of commercial menhaden catch in the chesapeake bay for a two year period 
the proposal would limit annual menhaden catch from the chesapeake bay to the bay s year average catch  or  metric tons 
the company s chesapeake bay fish catch was  metric tons in or approximately of the company s total fish catch 
the proposal would also initiate a concurrent research program to determine the status of menhaden populations in the bay and other scientific and biological issues that have been raised by various environmentalist  recreational fishermen and other special interest groups before the asmfc 
if the addendum were to be approved  it would be released for public hearings and comment over a several month period and further review by interested federal agencies 
after that process is completed  the menhaden management board may make a recommendation on the addendum to the asmfc interstate fisheries management policy board later in if that board were to ultimately approve the addendum  the addendum would be sent to individual asmfc member states for their adoption and implementation 
the company plans to participate in the public hearing and comment process in order to present evidence that the fishery is healthy and that no cap is needed and in fact  as proposed  may not be permissible under existing asmfc regulations and policies 
the imposition of management measures by the asmfc such as the proposed cap  must  pursuant to the asmfc s charter  be based on the best scientific information available 
the company believes  based on consultations with its scientific and technical advisors  that the proposed cap falls short of this standard 
if any limitation were to be ultimately imposed  it would likely become effective for the company s and fishing seasons 
the company  through its operation of fishing vessels  is subject to the jurisdiction of the us coast guard  the national transportation safety board and the us customs service 
the us coast guard and the national transportation safety board set safety standards and are authorized to investigate vessel accidents and recommend improved safety standards 
the us customs service is authorized to inspect vessels at will 
the company s operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment  including the federal clean water act  which imposes strict controls against the discharge of pollutants in reportable quantities  and along with the oil pollution act  imposes substantial liability for the costs of oil removal  remediation and damages 
the company s operations also are subject to the federal clean air act  as amended  the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  which imposes liability  without regard to fault  on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of any hazardous substances into the environment  and the federal occupational safety and health act osha 
the implementation of continuing safety and environmental regulations from these authorities could result in additional requirements and procedures for the company  and it is possible that the costs of these requirements and procedures could be material 
the osha hazard communications standard  the environmental protection agency community right to know regulations under title iii of the federal superfund amendment and reauthorization act and similar state statutes require the company to organize information about hazardous materials used or produced in its operations 
certain of this information must be provided to employees  state and local governmental authorities and local citizens 
numerous other environmental laws and regulations  along with similar state laws  also apply to the operations of the company  and all such laws and regulations are subject to change 
the company has made  and anticipates that it will make in the future  expenditures in the ordinary course of its business in connection with environmental matters 
such expenditures have not been material in the past  and while they are expected to increase in the future  such increases are not expected to be material to the company s business 
however  there is no assurance that environmental laws and regulations enacted in the future will not require material expenditures or otherwise adversely affect the company s operations 
the company continually monitors regulations which affect fish meal and fish oil in the united states and in those foreign jurisdictions where it sells its products 
in some cases  particularly in europe  regulators have mandated various environmental contaminant levels which  on occasion  certain of the company s products do not meet 
in those instances  the company has either negotiated a lower price with the customer for that product lot or has sold the product lot in another market where the regulatory standards are met 
to date  such regulations have not had a material adverse effect on the company s business  but it is possible they may do so in the future 
the company s harvesting operations are subject to the shipping act of and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the department of transportation  maritime administration which require  among other things  that the company be incorporated under the laws of the us or a state  the company s chief executive officer be a us citizen  no more of the company s directors be non citizens than a minority of the number necessary to constitute a quorum and at least of the company s outstanding capital stock including a majority of the company s voting capital stock be owned by us citizens 
if the company fails to observe any of these requirements  it will not be eligible to conduct its harvesting activities in us jurisdictional waters 
such a loss of eligibility would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
to protect against such loss of eligibility  the company s articles of incorporation i contain provisions limiting the aggregate percentage ownership by non citizens of each class of the company s capital stock to no more than of the outstanding shares of each such class the permitted percentage so that any purported transfer to non citizens of shares in excess of the permitted percentage will be ineffective as against the company for all purposes including for purposes of voting  dividends and any other distribution  upon liquidation or otherwise  ii provide for a dual stock certificate system to determine such ownership pursuant to which certificates representing shares of company common stock bear legends that designate such certificates as either citizen or non citizen depending on the citizenship of the owner  and iii permit the company s board of directors to make such determinations as may reasonably be necessary to ascertain such ownership and implement restrictive limitations on those shares that exceed the permitted percentage the excess shares 
for example  the company s board is authorized  among other things  to redeem for cash upon written notice any excess shares in order to reduce the aggregate ownership by non citizens to the permitted percentage 
the company believes that during the past five years it has substantially complied with all material statutes and regulations applicable to its operations  the failure to comply with which would have had a material adverse impact on its operations 
employees at december   during the company s off season  the company employed approximately persons 
at august   during the peak of the company s fishing season  the company employed approximately persons 
approximately employees at the company s reedville  virginia plant are represented by an affiliate of the united food and commercial workers union 
the union agreement for the reedville employees has a three year term which will terminate on april  the company has begun preliminary discussions with the union representatives regarding the terms of a new union agreement  but it is not possible at this time for the company to predict the outcome of those discussions 
during the past five years omega has not experienced any strike or work stoppage which has had a material impact on its operations 
the company considers its employee relations to be generally satisfactory

the following is a discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company appearing under item herein 
certain amounts applicable to the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the classifications currently followed 
such reclassifications do not affect earnings or stockholders equity 
general business 
omega is the largest us producer of protein rich meal and oil derived from marine sources 
the company s products are produced from menhaden a herring like fish found in commercial quantities  and include faq grade and value added specialty fish meals  crude and refined fish oils and regular and value added fish solubles 
the company s fish meal products are used as nutritional feed additives by animal feed manufacturers and by commercial livestock producers 
the company s crude fish oil is sold to food producers and feed manufacturers  and its refined fish oil products are used in food production and certain industrial applications 
fish solubles are sold as protein additives for animal feed and as fertilizers 
the company s harvesting season generally extends from may through december on the mid atlantic coast and from april through october on the gulf coast 
during the off season and the first few months of each fishing season  the company fills purchase orders from the inventory it has accumulated during the previous fishing season 
prices for the company s products tend to be lower during the fishing season when product is more abundant than in the off season 
throughout the entire year  prices are significantly influenced by supply and demand in world markets for competing products  particularly other globally produced fish meal and fish oil  as well as other animal proteins and soybean meal for its fish meal products  and vegetable fats and oils for its fish oil products when used as an alternative to vegetable fats and oils 
the fish catch is processed into faq grade fish meal  specialty fish meals  fish oils and fish solubles at the company s four operating plants located in virginia  mississippi and louisiana 
the company utilized fishing vessels and spotter craft in the harvesting operations during menhaden are harvested offshore the us mid atlantic and gulf of mexico coasts 
in  the company converted several of its fishing vessels to carry vessels which do not engage in active fishing but instead carry fish from the company s offshore fishing vessels to its plants 
utilization of carry vessels increases the amount of time that certain of the company s fishing vessels remain offshore fishing productive waters and therefore increases the company s fish catch per vessel employed 
the carry vessels have reduced crews and crew expenses and incur less maintenance cost then the actual fishing vessels 
harvesting and production 
the following table summarizes the company s harvesting and production for the indicated periods years ended december  fish catch tons production tons fish meal regular grade special select sea lac oil crude refined solubles total production fish catch has been converted to tons using the national marine fisheries service nmfs fish catch conversion ratio of pounds per  fish 
during and  the company experienced a poor fish catch approximately and  respectively  below expectations and a similar reduction from  combined with poor oil yields 
the reduced fish catch was primarily attributable to adverse weather conditions and the poor oil yields due to the reduced fat content of the fish 
as a result of the poor fish catch and reduced yields  the company experienced significantly higher per unit product costs approximately increase during compared to the impact of higher cost inventories and fewer volumes available for sale will be carried forward and will adversely affect the company s earnings through the first and second quarters of markets 
pricing for the company s products has been volatile in the past several years and is attributable mainly to the international availability  or the perceived international availability  of fish meal and fish oil inventories 
in an effort to reduce price volatility and to generate higher  more consistent profit margins  in fiscal the company embarked on a quality control program designed to increase its capability of producing higher quality fish meal products and  in conjunction therewith  enhanced it sales efforts to penetrate premium product markets 
since  the company s sales volumes of specialty meal products have increased approximately 
future volumetric growth in specialty meal sales will be dependant upon increased harvesting efforts and market demand 
additionally  the company is attempting to introduce its refined fish oil into the food market 
the company has made sales  which to date have not been material  of its refined fish oil  trademarked omegapure  to food manufacturers in the united states and canada at prices that provide substantially improved margins over the margins that can be obtained from selling non refined crude fish oil 
the company cannot estimate  however  the size of the actual domestic or international markets for omega pure or how long it may take to develop these markets 
during  the company developed a business plan to expand its purchase and resale of other manufacturers fish meal and fish oil products and engaged a full time consultant to implement the company s business plan which focused initially on the purchase and resale of mexican fish meal and fish oil 
in  revenues generated from these types of transactions represented less than of total company revenues 
during and again in  the company s fish catch and resultant product inventories were reduced  primarily due to adverse weather conditions 
the company supplemented its inventories and subsequent sales by purchasing other fish meal and oil products 
although operating margins from these activities are less than the margins typically generated from the company s base domestic production  these operations provide the company with a source of fish meal and oil to sell into other markets where the company has not historically had a presence 
the company purchased products totaling approximately  and  tons  or approximately and of total volume sales for the fiscal year ended december  and the fiscal year ended december   respectively 
during  the company s fishing efforts in the gulf of mexico were hampered by numerous hurricanes and bad weather which resulted in lower fish catches than predicted 
as a result  the company s per unit product costs were higher than anticipated and were higher than those experienced in the season 
such reduced fish catch quantities results in higher cost inventories and correspondingly higher cost of sales  as well as less available product for sale 
the impact of the higher costs inventories and fewer volumes available for sale will be carried forward which will adversely affect company earnings in the first and second quarters of fiscal historically  approximately to of omega s faq fish meal was sold on a two to twelve month forward contract basis 
the balance of regular grade and other products was substantially sold on a spot basis through purchase orders 
the company began a similar forward sales program for its specialty grade meals and crude fish oil for due to increasing demand for these products 
during and  approximately and  respectively  of its specialty meals and crude fish oil had been sold on a forward contract basis 
the company s annual revenues are highly dependent on both annual fish catch and inventories and  in addition  inventory is generally carried over from one year to another year 
the company determines the level of inventory to be carried over based on prevailing market prices of the products and anticipated customer usage and demand during the off season 
thus  production volume does not necessarily correlate with sales volume in the same year and sales volumes will fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
the company s fish meal products have a useable life of approximately one year from date of production 
practically  however  the company typically attempts to empty its warehouses of the previous season s products by the second or third month of the new fishing season 
the company s crude fish oil products do not lose efficacy unless exposed to oxygen and therefore  their storage life typically is longer than that of fish meal 
the following table sets forth the company s revenues by product in millions and the approximate percentage of total revenues represented thereby  for the indicated periods years ended december  revenues percent revenues percent revenues percent regular grade special select sealac crude oil refined oil fish solubles total liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources have been cash flows from operations  bank credit facilities and term loans from various lenders provided pursuant to the national marine fisheries finance program under title xi of the marine act of title xi 
these sources of cash flows have been used for capital expenditures and payment of long term debt 
the company expects to finance future expenditures through internally generated cash flows and  if necessary  through funds available from the credit facility and or title xi facilities described below 
under a program offered through national marine fisheries services nmfs pursuant to title xi  the company has secured loans through lenders with terms generally ranging between and years at interest rates between and per annum which are enhanced with a government guaranty to the lender for up to of the financing 
the company s current title xi borrowings are secured by liens on fishing vessels and mortgages on the company s reedville  virginia and abbeville  louisiana plants 
in  title xi borrowing was modified to permit use of proceeds from borrowings obtained through this program for shoreside construction 
the company used the entire million amount originally authorized under the program 
loans are now available under similar terms pursuant to the title xi program without intervening lenders 
the company borrowed million under this new program during and borrowed an additional million title xi loan on december  on september   pursuant to the title xi program  the united states department of commerce approved a financing application made by the company in the amount of million the approval letter 
in december  the company submitted a million financing request to be drawn against the million approved financing application 
the company expects to receive the million financing request in march of the company had no borrowings outstanding under the approval letter at december  borrowings under this title xi program may be used for refurbishment of the company s fishing vessels and capital expenditures relating to the company s shore side fishing assets 
the title xi loans are secured by liens on certain of the company s fishing vessels and mortgages on the company s reedville  virginia and abbeville and cameron  louisiana plants 
omega had an unrestricted cash balance of million at december   down million from december  this decrease was due primarily to increased capital expenditures largely related to the construction of the company s new fish oil processing facility at its reedville  virginia location 
the company s liquidity is greatly influenced by the selling prices received for its products 
should the company experience decreased pricing in the future  as it experienced in and  liquidity would decline and the company would possibly have to utilize its working capital credit facility 
the company s long term debt at december  and december   was million and million  respectively 
current maturities attributable to the company s long term debt were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the company did not utilize its working capital credit facility during and other than for million and million in standby letters of credit as of december  and  respectively

the company s investing activities in  and consisted mainly of capital expenditures for equipment purchases  replacements  vessel refurbishments  and a fish oil processing facility 
in october  the company completed construction and commenced operations of a new health and science center at a cost of million 
the company will incur higher annual depreciation costs as a result of it s new health and science center 
the company funded the project through its available cash balances 
the company anticipates making approximately million of capital expenditures in additionally  the company has entered into a non binding letter of intent to purchase a acre facility containing office and warehouse space located next to the company s moss point  mississippi facility 
the proposed purchase price is million 
the property would allow the company to develop additional and more cost effective rail and trucking opportunities and enhanced packaging capabilities 
if the company acquires the property  the company estimates that it will spend an additional million in for capital improvements to the property

the company was in compliance with the credit covenants at december  as of december  the company had no cash borrowings outstanding under the credit facility 
at december  and december   the company had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately million and million  respectively issued primarily in support of worker s compensation insurance programs 
on december   the company entered into a three year million revolving credit agreement with bank of america  na the credit facility 
borrowings under this facility may be used for working capital and capital expenditures 
on may   the company amended the existing credit facility and among other things  these amendments extended the maturity until december   deleted certain existing financial covenants and added certain affirmative covenants such as  a leverage ratio covenant not to exceed to at any time and a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant not to be less than to as of the end of each month  measured for the twelve month period then ended 
the company is required to comply with the financial covenants from and after the last day of any month in which the credit facility s availability is less than million on any date  or the credit facility s availability averages less than million for any calendar month 
a commitment fee of basis points per annum is payable on the unused portion of the credit facility

in december  the company submitted a million financing request 
the company expects to receive the million financing request in march of as of december   the company had no borrowings outstanding under the approval letter 
the company s principal raw material is menhaden  a species of fish that inhabits coastal and inland tidal waters in the united states 
menhaden are undesirable for direct human consumption due to their small size  prominent bones and high oil content 
certain state agencies  as well as interstate compacts  impose resource depletion restrictions on menhaden pursuant to fisheries management legislation or regulations and may impose additional legislation or regulations in the future 
for example  the menhaden management board of the asmfc voted in february to initiate the preparation of an addendum to the existing asmfc interstate management plan for atlantic menhaden which would limit the amount of commercial menhaden catch in the chesapeake bay for a two year period 
the proposal  if ultimately passed  would limit annual menhaden catch from the chesapeake bay to the bay s year average catch  or  metric tons 
the company s chesapeake bay fish catch was  metric tons in or approximately of the company s total fish catch 
if any limitation were to be ultimately imposed  it would likely become effective for the company s and fishing seasons 
see item and business and properties company overview regulation 
to date  the company has not experienced any material adverse impact on its fish catch or results of operations as a result of these restrictions 
the company from time to time considers potential transactions including  but not limited to  enhancement of physical facilities to improve production capabilities and the acquisition of other businesses 
certain of the potential transactions reviewed by the company would  if completed  result in its entering new lines of business generally including certain businesses to which the company sells its products such as pet food manufacturers  aquaculture feed manufacturers  fertilizer companies and organic foods distributors although historically  reviewed opportunities have been generally related in some manner to the company s existing operations 
although the company does not  as of the date hereof  have any commitment with respect to a material acquisition  it could enter into such agreement in the future 
the company carries insurance for certain losses relating to its vessels and jones act liability for employees aboard its vessels collectively  vessel claims insurance 
the typical vessel claims insurance policy contains an annual aggregate deductible aad for which the company remains responsible  while the insurance carrier is responsible for all applicable amounts which exceed the aad 
it is the company s policy to accrue current amounts due and record amounts paid out on each claim 
once payments exceed the aad  the company records an insurance receivable for a given policy year 
in  the company s vessel claims insurance carrier for the period october  through september   and for of the company s jones act claims for the period october  through march  was declared insolvent by a state insurance regulator 
the company had previously provided an allowance for doubtful accounts for all the amount due to the company from the insurance carrier 
the company believes that the existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and funds available through its credit facility will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein  including estimates about the effects of matters or future events that are inherently uncertain 
the most significant of these requiring difficult or complex judgments in any particular period involve the costing of inventory  including inventory lower of cost or market analyses and the company s accounting for various losses on self insurance retentions 
impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates at each balance sheet date the continued appropriateness of the carrying value of its long lived assets including its long term receivables and property  plant and equipment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposals of long lived assets 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such assets may not be recoverable 
if indicators of impairment are present  management would evaluate the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets compared to the carrying amount of those items 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
the company considers continued operating losses  or significant and long term changes in business conditions  to be its primary indicators of potential impairment 
in measuring impairment  the company looks to quoted market prices  if available  or the best information available in the circumstances 
inventories inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
the company s fishing season runs from mid april to the first of november in the gulf of mexico and from the beginning of may into december in the atlantic 
government regulations generally preclude the company from fishing during the off seasons 
the company s inventory cost system considers all costs associated with an annual fish catch and its processing  both variable and fixed and includes both costs incurred during the off season and during the fishing season 
the company s costing system allocates cost to inventory quantities on a per unit basis as calculated by a formula that considers total estimated inventoriable costs for a fishing season including off season costs to total estimated fish catch and the relative fair market value of the individual products produced 
the company adjusts the cost of sales  off season costs and inventory balances at the end of each quarter based on revised estimates of total inventoriable costs and fish catch 
the company s lower of cost or market value analyses at year end and at interim periods compares total estimated per unit production cost of the company s expected production to the projected per unit market prices of the products 
the impairment analyses involve estimates of  among other things  future fish catches and related costs  and expected commodity prices for the fish products 
these estimates  which management believes are reasonable and supportable  involve estimates of future activities and events which are inherently imprecise and from which actual results may differ materially 
revisions in such estimates or actual results could materially impact the company s results of operation and financial position 
during the off seasons  in connection with the upcoming fishing seasons  the company incurs costs ie  plant and vessel related labor  utilities  rent  repairs and depreciation that are directly related to the company s infrastructure 
these costs accumulate in inventory and are applied as elements of the cost of production of the company s products throughout the fishing season ratably based on the company s monthly fish catch and the expected total fish catch for the season 
insurance as mentioned previously  the company carries insurance for certain losses relating to its vessels and jones act liabilities for employees aboard its vessels 
the company provides reserves for those portions of the aad for which the company remains responsible by using an estimation process that considers company specific and industry data as well as management s experience  assumptions and consultation with outside counsel 
management s current estimated range of liabilities related to such cases is based on claims for which management can estimate the amount and range of loss 
the process of estimating and establishing reserves for these claims is inherently uncertain and the actual ultimate net cost of a claim may vary materially from the estimated amount reserved 
as additional information becomes available  the company will assess the potential liability related to its pending litigation and revise its estimates 
such revisions in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact the company s results of operations and financial position 
pension the company estimates income or expense related to its pension plan based on actuarial assumptions  including assumptions regarding discount rates and expected returns on plan assets 
the company determines the discount rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of its pension obligations 
based on historical data and discussions with its actuary  omega determines its expected return on plan assets based on the expected long term rate of return on its plan assets and the market related value of its plan assets 
changes in these assumptions can result in significant changes in estimated pension income or expense 
the company will revise its assumptions on an annual basis based upon changes in current interest rates  return on plan assets and the underlying demographics of the workforce 
these assumptions are reasonably likely to change in future periods and may have a material impact on future earnings

seasonal and quarterly results the company s menhaden harvesting and processing business is seasonal in nature 
the company generally has higher sales during the menhaden harvesting season which includes the second and third quarter of each year due to increased product availability  but prices during the fishing season tend to be lower than during the off season 
as a result  the company s quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future 
in addition  from time to time the company defers sales of inventory based on worldwide prices for competing products that affect prices for the company s products which may affect comparable period comparisons 
quarterly financial data contained in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report are incorporated herein by reference 
risk factors and significant factors that may affect forward looking statements the company cautions investors that the following risk factors  and those factors described elsewhere in this report  other filings by the company with the sec from time to time and press releases issued by the company  could affect the company s actual results which could differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing the company 
the company s business is also subject to other risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies  such as competition  technological obsolescence  labor relations including risks of strikes  general economic conditions and geopolitical events 
additional risks not currently known to the company or risks that the company currently believes are immaterial may also impair the company s business  results of operations and financial results 
risks relating to the company s business and industry the company is dependent on a single natural resource and may not be able to catch the amount of menhaden that it requires to operate profitably 
the company s primary raw material is menhaden 
the company s business is totally dependent on its annual menhaden harvest in ocean waters along the us atlantic and gulf coasts 
the company s ability to meet its raw material requirements through its annual menhaden harvest fluctuates from year to year  and even at times month to month  due to natural conditions over which the company has no control 
these natural conditions  which include varying fish population  adverse weather conditions and disease  may prevent the company from catching the amount of menhaden required to operate profitability 
fluctuation in oil yields derived from the company s fish catch could impact the company s ability to operate profitably 
the oil yield  or the percentage of oil derived from the menhaden fish  while it is relatively high compared to many species of fish  has fluctuated over the years and from month to month due to natural conditions relating to fish biology over which the company has no control 
the oil yield has at times materially impacted the amount of fish oil that the company has been able to produce from its available fish catch and it is possible that oil yields in the future could also impact the company s ability to operate profitably 
laws or regulations that restrict or prohibit menhaden or purse seine fishing operations could adversely affect the company s ability to operate 
the adoption of new laws or regulations at federal  regional  state or local levels that restrict or prohibit menhaden or purse seine fishing operations  or stricter interpretations of existing laws or regulations  could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the impact of a violation by the company of federal  regional  state or local law or regulation relating to its fishing operations  the protection of the environment or the health and safety of its employees could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
one example of potentially restrictive regulation involves a vote by a regional regulatory board in february to permit discussion on  and consider for potential adoption  a proposal which could limit for a two year period the annual amount commercial menhaden catch in the chesapeake bay to the bay s year average catch  or  metric tons 
see item and business and properties company overview regulation for more information 
the company s fish catch may be impacted by restrictions on its spotter aircraft 
if the company s spotter aircraft are prohibited or restricted from operating in their normal manner during the company s fishing season  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
for example  as a direct result of the september  terrorist attacks  the secretary of transportation issued a federal ground stop order that grounded certain aircraft including the company s fish spotting aircraft for approximately nine days 
this loss of spotter aircraft coverage severely hampered the company s ability to locate menhaden fish during this nine day period and thereby reduced its amount of saleable product 
worldwide supply and demand relationships  which are beyond the company s control  influence the prices that the company receives for many of its products and may from time to time result in low prices for many of the company s products 
prices for many of the company s products are subject to  or influenced by  worldwide supply and demand relationships over which the company has no control and which tend to fluctuate to a significant extent over the course of a year and from year to year 
the factors that influence these supply and demand relationships are world supplies of fish meal made from other fish species  animal proteins and fats  palm oil  soy meal and oil  and other edible oils 
new laws or regulation regarding contaminants in fish oil or fish meal may increase the company s cost of production or cause the company to lose business 
it is possible that future enactment of increasingly stringent regulations regarding contaminants in fish meal or fish oil by foreign countries or the united states may adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
more stringent regulations could result in i the company s incurrence of additional capital expenditures on contaminant reduction technology in order to meet the requirements of those jurisdictions  and possibly higher production costs for company s products  or ii the company s withdrawal from marketing its products in those jurisdictions 
risks relating to the company s ongoing operations the company s strategy to expand into the food grade oils market may be unsuccessful 
the company s attempts to expand its fish oil sales into the market for refined  food grade fish oils for human consumption may not be successful 
the company s expectations regarding future demand for omega fatty acids may prove to be incorrect or  if future demand does meet the company s expectations  it is possible that purchasers could utilize omega sources other than the company s products 
the company s quarterly operating results will fluctuate 
fluctuations in the company s quarterly operating results will occur due to the seasonality of the company s business  the unpredictability of the company s fish catch and oil yields  and the company s deferral of sales of inventory based on worldwide prices for competing products 
the company s business is subject to significant competition  and some competitors have significantly greater financial resources and more extensive and diversified operations than the company 
the marine protein and oil business is subject to significant competition from producers of vegetable and other animal protein products and oil products such as archer daniels midland and cargill 
in addition  but to a lesser extent  the company competes with small domestic privately owned menhaden fishing companies and international marine protein and oil producers  including scandinavian herring processors and south american anchovy and sardine processors 
many of these competitors have significantly greater financial resources and more extensive and diversified operations than the company 
the company s foreign customers are subject to disruption typical to foreign countries 
the company s sales of its products in foreign countries are subject to risks associated with foreign countries such as changes in social  political and economic conditions inherent in foreign operations  including changes in the law and policies that govern foreign investment and international trade in foreign countries  changes in us laws and regulations relating to foreign investment and trade  changes in tax or other laws  partial or total expropriation  current exchange rate fluctuations  restrictions on current repatriation  or political disturbances  insurrection or war 
in addition  it is possible that the company  at any one time  could have a significant amount of its revenues generated by sales in a particular country which would concentrate the company s susceptibility to adverse events in that country 
the company may undertake acquisitions that are unsuccessful and the company s inability to control the inherent risks of acquiring businesses could adversely affect its business  results of operations and financial condition operations 
in the future the company may undertake acquisitions of other businesses  located either in the united states or in other countries  although there can be no assurances that this will occur 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able i to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on favorable terms  ii to profitably manage future businesses it may acquire  or iii to successfully integrate future businesses it may acquire without substantial costs  delays or other problems 
any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s failure to comply with federal us citizenship ownership requirements may prevent it from harvesting menhaden in the us jurisdictional waters 
the company s harvesting operations are subject to the shipping act of and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the department of transportation  maritime administration which require  among other things  that the company be incorporated under the laws of the us or a state  the company s chief executive officer be a us citizen  no more of the company s directors be non citizens than a minority of a number necessary to constitute a quorum and at least of the company s outstanding capital stock including a majority of its voting capital stock be owned by us citizens 
if the company fails to observe any of these requirements  the company will not be eligible to conduct its harvesting activities in us jurisdictional waters 
such a lost of eligibility would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company may not be able to recruit  train and retain qualified marine personnel in sufficient numbers 
the company s business is dependent on its ability to recruit  train and retain qualified marine personnel in sufficient numbers such as vessel captains  vessel engineers and other crewmembers 
to the extent that the company is not successful in recruiting  training and retaining these employees in sufficient numbers  its productivity may suffer 
if the company were unable to secure a sufficient number of workers during periods of peak employment  the lack of personnel could have an adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
investment risks 
investment risks specifically related to the company s common stock include the company s market liquidity for its common stock is relatively low 
as of december   the company had  shares of common stock outstanding 
the average daily trading volume in the company s common stock during the twelve month period ending december  was approximately  shares 
although a more active trading market may develop in the future  the limited market liquidity for the company s stock could affect a stockholder s ability to sell at a price satisfactory to that stockholder 
if significant shares eligible for future sale are sold  the result could depress the company s stock price by increasing the supply of shares in the market at a time when demand may be limited 
as of december   the company had approximately million shares of common stock outstanding  as well as stock options to purchase approximately million shares of common stock 
of these options  approximately million were exercisable at december  in addition  certain of the company s officers and directors have entered into rule b sales plans with brokers unaffiliated with the company whereby they have committed to sell automatically and without discretion a predetermined number of shares of company common stock over a period of time according to their own individual criteria 
to the extent that the above stock options are exercised or the above shares are sold  it is possible that the increase in the number of the company s outstanding shares could adversely affect the price for the company s common stock 
the company is controlled by a principal stockholder 
zapata corporation  a publicly traded company  owns approximately of the company s common stock 
as a result  zapata has the ability to elect all the members of the company s board of directors and otherwise control the management and affairs of the company 
zapata s ownership will make an unsolicited acquisition of the company s common stock more difficult  and could discourage certain types of transactions in which holders of company common stock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over current market prices 
in addition  because of zapata s majority ownership  the company is a controlled company under the new york stock exchange corporate governance guidelines and accordingly  is exempt from certain of the nyse corporate governance requirements 
the company s articles of incorporation and bylaws  nevada law  and federal law have provisions that discourage corporate takeovers and could prevent stockholders from realizing a premium on their investment 
certain provisions of the company s articles of incorporation and bylaws  as well as the nevada corporation law  to which the company is subject  could delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors and could make difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involvement the company  even if such events could be viewed as beneficial by its stockholders 
the company s board of directors is empowered to issue preferred stock in one or more series without stockholder action 
any issuance of this blank check preferred stock could materially limit the rights of holders of the company s common stock and render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of the company by means of a tender offer  merger  proxy contest or otherwise 
in additional  the articles of incorporation and bylaws contain a number of provisions which could impede a takeover or change in control of the company  including  among other things  staggered terms for members of its board of directors  the requiring of two thirds vote of stockholders to amend certain provisions of the articles of incorporation or the inability  after zapata no longer owns a majority of the company s common stock  to take action by written consent or to call special stockholder meetings 
certain provisions of the nevada corporation law could also discourage takeover attempts that have not been approved by the company s board of directors 
in addition  federal law requires that at least of the company s outstanding capital stock be owned by us citizens which will discourage takeover attempts by potential foreign purchasers 
the company has not paid dividends and does not expect to pay dividends in the near future 
the company has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its common stock since it became a public company in april and has no intention to do so in the near future 
any determination as to payment of dividends will be made at the discretion of the company s board of directors and will depend upon the company s operating results  financial condition  capital requirements  general business conditions and such other factors that the board of directors deems relevant 
in addition  the payment of cash dividends is not permitted by the terms of the company s revolving credit agreement with bank of american  na item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the normal course of business  the financial condition of the company is exposed to minimal market risk associated with interest rate movements on the company s borrowings 
a one percent increase or decrease in the levels of interest rates on variable rate debt would not result in a material change to the company s results of operations 
although the company sells products in foreign countries  all of the company s revenues are billed and paid for in us dollars 
as a result  management does not believe that the company is exposed to any significant foreign country currency exchange risk  and the company does not utilize market risk sensitive instruments to manage its exposure to this risk
