prior to this meeting  management had obtained a draft letter of intent from a prospective buyer of the paging business which was presented to the board at this meeting 
after review of the information presented by management  which included the future business direction of the company  its ability to continue to operate as a going concern and the estimated value of its paging and two way radio business units  the board met on july  and authorized the company s management to continue negotiations with the prospective buyer of the paging business 
additionally  the board authorized the company to solicit offers on the two way radio business and considered j 
kernan crotty s  the company s president and cfo  offer to buy the company s two way radio business 
these and other matters are described below 
on august  the company entered into an asset purchase agreement dated as of august  to sell substantially all of the assets of its paging business to teletouch paging  lp buyer  a newly formed and non affiliated limited partnership  wholly owned by a private fort worth  texas investment group 
this transaction is expected to close within ten days after shareholder approval is obtained 
the buyer s aggregate consideration for the acquired assets was originally contemplated to be approximately million as of august  and will be payable as follows i  less the cumulative cash flows attributable to the paging business from september  through the closing date to be payable in cash to the company on the closing date  ii  non interest bearing note payable to the company due in monthly payments of  each beginning the earlier of the date that buyer has satisfied its obligations under its senior borrowings or august  and iii the assumption of approximately  notes payable related to vehicles being sold collectively  the purchase price 
because the transaction is not expected to close before november   the consideration received by the company for the sale will be reduced by an estimated million which approximates the operating cash flow of the paging business from september  through november  further delays in closing this transaction will reduce the purchase price by approximately million per month 
the million promissory note payable to the company will be secured by a lien on the assets subject to customary subordination provisions required by the buyer s senior lender 
the purchase price is subject to adjustment based on the company s net working capital  as defined in the apa  at closing and the value of any excess net working capital transferred will be paid to the company by the buyer within days of closing

index to financial statements triggered upon a sale of substantially all of the assets of the company  as defined in the warrant agreement 
further  on september   the warrant holders notified the company of their intent to accelerate the redemption of the warrants based on the same trigger event that allows them voting rights causing the  redemption value to become due and payable upon the closing of this sale 
under the basic terms of the warrant agreement the redeemable common stock warrants could not be redeemed until december the company is currently negotiating a reduction in the amount due to the warrant holders upon the closing of the sale transaction and believes if it is unsuccessful in reaching terms on this obligation the warrant holders may vote against the sale of the paging business and therefore block the contemplated asset sale transactions 
robert m 
mcmurrey  chairman of teletouch and controlling person of tll partners llc  an entity that owns approximately of the outstanding common stock of teletouch as of the date hereof  has agreed to vote in favor of the transaction unless an agreement cannot be reached with the company s warrant holders which reduces the amount payable as a result of the acceleration of the redemption feature of the warrants 
the sale of the paging business is expected to close within ten days following the receipt of the required shareholder approval 
the company is preparing proxy solicitation materials in connection with a special meeting of the shareholders of the company to be held to vote on this proposed asset sale transaction 
however  the special meeting of the company s shareholders is not expected to occur before november  due to certain delays encountered in the filing of the company s annual report on form k for the year ended may  which delay  in turn  is causing a delay the company s filing of its proxy statement for this special meeting

on july   the company received a letter of intent from j 
kernan crotty  president and cfo of teletouch  to purchase the assets of the two way radio business 
the board considered the terms and provisions of this offer 
however  the letter of intent expired as of august  in accordance with its terms and provisions 
no further action has been taken with regard to the letter of intent 
because of effort involved in completing the sale transaction of the company s paging business and the delays anticipated in closing that transaction  the company has delayed its consideration of the offer on the two way business 
while the company is continuing to solicit other offers in connection with the possible sale of its two way radio business  it does not preclude the possibility of extending mr 
crotty s letter of intent 
as of the date hereof  no such extension has been executed 
the proposed sales of these business units represent substantially all of the assets and operations of teletouch communications  inc the proceeds expected from these sale transactions are planned to be used to acquire a growth business for the company

teletouch anticipates that the demand for one way paging services will continue to decline for the foreseeable future  which will result in reductions in service  rent and maintenance revenues due to the lower volume of subscribers 
the increase in two way service revenue for fiscal year ended may  is due primarily to the acquisition of the customer base from delta communications in the dallas fort worth  texas market

the decrease in other expenses for the fiscal year ended may  is due to a reduction in bad debt expenses related to the declining retail subscriber base  as well as  increased collection efforts

the company evaluates goodwill at the reporting segment level as of march st of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
as required by sfas no  the impairment test is accomplished using a two stepped approach 
the first step screens for impairment and  when impairment is indicated  a second step is employed to measure the impairment 
the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge during the fourth quarter of fiscal of  presented as an operating expense which resulted primarily from a decline in the profitability of our dallas fort worth two way radio operations within the two way radio reporting segment of the company 
the goodwill impairment was recorded due to the decreased sales in our logic trunked radio ltr sales resulting from increased competition in the market from other two way radio provider and cellular companies  lower demand for these services and limited sales staff during the year focusing on this portion of the business

other operating expenses discussion for the fiscal year ended may  and may  depreciation and amortization the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal year ended may  is due to the write off of fixed assets to match the fixed asset physical inventory in the quarter ended february  the decrease is primarily due to a write off of certain paging infrastructure equipment  write downs on excess furniture  fixtures and computer equipment held for sale  and charges to write off leasehold improvements relating to store closings 
this decrease is offset slightly by an increase in depreciation expense resulting from additional property  plant and equipment and intangible assets acquired from delta communications in january related to the two way business acquired in the dallas fort worth market 
loss on disposal of assets the increase in loss on disposal of assets is due primarily to the abandonment of million of computer software programs in the third quarter of fiscal the company purchased the computer software  in fiscal  which was represented to be a fully integrated system

write off of equipment during the second quarter of fiscal  the company completed verification procedures of its property  plant and equipment 
as a result of the procedures performed  certain paging infrastructure equipment was not identified 
the company believes that a significant amount of the equipment not identified was attributable to ongoing significant repair and upgrades of its network performed on its paging infrastructure over the seven years prior to this verification without always accurately accounting for the replacement or removal of capitalizable infrastructure equipment 
during these prior periods  the removal of certain equipment during the maintenance process was not recorded 
due to the seven year time period over which this activity likely took place it was impractical for the company to accurately attribute this loss to the period in which it occurred  therefore  the company recorded a charge of approximately  during the second quarter of fiscal to write off the remaining carrying value of this equipment 
the company believes that the amount of the loss attributable to any prior year is not significant to any prior annual operating results or financial position 
interest expense  net of interest income for the fiscal years ended may   and net interest expense remained at million in fiscal years  and interest expense  net of interest income primarily consists of the accretion of the redeemable common stock purchase warrants and common stock payable  interest expense related to a line of credit with first community financial corporation fcfc and the interest related to various automobile notes

teletouch s operations require capital investment to purchase inventory for lease to customers and to acquire paging infrastructure equipment to support the company s existing subscribers 
net capital expenditures  including pagers  were million and million for the fiscal years ended may  and  respectively 
teletouch anticipates capital expenditures to continue to decline during the fiscal due primarily to the continuing decline in the number of leased pagers in service 
additionally  the company plans to replace only necessary equipment to maintain the paging infrastructure 
teletouch expects to pay for these expenditures with cash generated from operations 
financing activities the decrease in cash used by financing activities for the fiscal year ended may  as compared to the fiscal year ended may  was due primarily to approximately  less in principal payments made on the company s credit agreement with tll partners tll note and certain vehicle notes 
the decrease in cash used by financing activities for the fiscal year ended may  as compared to the fiscal year ended may  was due partly to approximately  in net reductions on the company s outstanding borrowings from first community financial corporation fcfc in fiscal as compared to  in net reductions during fiscal the borrowing arrangement with fcfc was cancelled by the company in february additionally  the company made principal payments totaling  to ing prime rate trust and tll partners in fiscal as compared to  in principal payments to tll partners in fiscal in december  the company retired its obligations under its note due to ing prime rate trust 
current position future requirements teletouch s primary focus during the fiscal years of and was on positioning the company for growth in the future through the recapitalization of its debt and certain equity securities and the restructuring of its operations to maximize efficiency and profitability 
the company succeeded in recapitalizing its debt and certain equity securities in may by may  the company had completed its restructuring efforts and exited its retail distribution channel 
the company has continued  during  to follow its overall business strategy of minimizing the level of paging customer attrition while attempting to develop new revenue streams from telemetry products to minimize the impact of the loss in recurring revenues from its declining paging subscriber base 
the company s successful recapitalization of its debt and certain equity securities and the previous restructuring of its operations have allowed the company to be able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet its capital needs for the previous two fiscal years 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in order for the company to continue to generate sufficient cash flow going forward  it will become necessary to exit its core paging and two way radio businesses in this decision was made by the company s board of directors shortly after year end and as discussed above  the company has located a buyer for its paging business 
the company has struggled for the past several years to minimize the costs of operating its paging business in a time of declining revenues 
with paging revenues expected to continue declining for the foreseeable future and a relatively fixed cost structure of maintaining the paging network and infrastructure  it has become increasingly difficult to project being able to maintain a positive cash flow from the paging business 
the two way radio business has had some limited revenue growth over the past year due to homeland security grants being made available to local public safety entities to upgrade their communications systems 
we believe these revenue opportunities will extend for the next two years at which time many of these customers utilizing homeland security grant monies today will have limited needs for replacement or upgrades of their radio systems in future years which will result in a decline in revenues for teletouch 
the two way radio business also operates a radio system on which it sells subscription services 
this business has been declining over the past year as customers migrate to newer technologies including cellular telephones 
the company does not believe the two way radio business is a growth business  although it has been a stable business for the company for many years 
three years ago  the company recognized the trends in its core businesses and began to develop a telemetry business 
to date revenues from the telemetry business have been insignificant 
the market for telemetry products is large and relatively new but continued technical issues with our telemetry products have prohibited the company from growing this business 
the current prospects of the company s core paging and two way radio business units coupled with the lack of success in the telemetry business led the company to look to a strategy that allow the company to grow the business again in the future 
the only solution apparent was to divest the current businesses and buy another business with revenue prospects that could carry the company forward 
after selling the paging and two way radio business units  the company plans to acquire one or more growth companies and integrate them into the existing infrastructure at teletouch 
the company believes that the sale of its core businesses is necessary at this point while there is still value in these businesses and has currently identified and is in negotiations with several target companies for acquisition 
in the interim period after the sale and through the time a new company is acquired  teletouch will continue to operate as a publicly traded company and restructure its existing telemetry business to reduce the losses being generated by this business 
the company anticipates integrating its ongoing telemetry operations with one of the potential acquisition targets 
subsequent to the successful sale of the paging and two way radio business  most of the company s efforts over the coming months will focus on minimizing expenses of the remaining operations while securing additional financing to complete an acquisition 
from may through the first quarter of fiscal  the company had available borrowings under a credit facility with tll partners  a company controlled by robert mcmurrey  chairman of the board of teletouch  and under a separate credit facility with fcfc 
during the quarter ended november   the company was notified by both lenders of restrictions placed on the availability of these borrowings 
as of may   the company has no borrowings outstanding under its million promissory note with tll partners 
any borrowings under this arrangement are subject to the approval of the pcci board of directors and availability of funds 
tll partners is a wholly owned subsidiary of pcci 
the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements company has had limited borrowings under this agreement in the past and has been given no assurances from tll partners or pcci that the necessary approval would be given by the pcci board of directors to fund any future operating or capital needs of teletouch 
the company s management does not anticipate that the necessary approvals would be granted by the pcci board of directors  therefore  it is operating under the assumption that there are no available borrowings under this agreement 
in february  the company cancelled its multiple advance promissory note map note with first community financial corporation fcfc 
the company initiated the early termination of the map note because it had not had to access this line of credit for the past several quarters and the continuance of this agreement created unnecessary administration functions and their related costs within the company 
under the terms of the map note  the company was required to comply with certain financial covenants on a monthly basis 
failure to maintain compliance with these covenants is an event of default as defined under fcfc security agreement 
during the first and second quarters of fiscal  the company was unable to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants in the map note 
the company did receive a waiver of these covenants which allowed the company to remain in good standing under the terms of the map note for the quarters ending august  and november  there is no assurance that the company will be able to improve its cash flow from operations  obtain additional third party financing  generate additional new revenues  complete the sale of the two way radio business or complete any acquisitions it is evaluating 
if a combination of these events does not occur the company may not have sufficient cash to operate the business over the next year from the proceeds of the sale of the paging business alone 
the sale of the paging business is contingent on shareholder approval 
as a result of the certain rights contained in  redeemable common stock warrants issued by the company as part of its debt and equity restructuring in  the holders of these warrants warrant holders have a right to vote separately as a class on the sale of the paging business since these rights are triggered upon a sale of substantially all of the assets of the company  as defined in the warrant agreement 
further  on september   the warrant holders notified the company of their intent to accelerate the redemption of the warrants based on the same trigger event that allows them voting rights causing the  redemption value to become due and payable upon the closing of this sale 
under the basic terms of the warrant agreement the redeemable common stock warrants could not be redeemed until december the company is currently negotiating a reduction in the amount due to the warrant holders upon the closing of the sale transaction and believes if it is unsuccessful in reaching terms on this obligation the warrant holders may vote against the sale of the paging business and therefore block the contemplated asset sale transactions 
robert m 
mcmurrey  chairman of teletouch and controlling person of tll partners llc  an entity that owns approximately of the outstanding common stock of teletouch as of the date hereof  has agreed to vote in favor of the transaction unless an agreement cannot be reached with the company s warrant holders which reduces the amount payable as a result of the acceleration of the redemption feature of the warrants 
a special shareholders meeting is planned shortly after the filing of the report to seek approval for the sale of the paging business 
going concern matters based on current and anticipated levels of operations  the company s management anticipates that net cash provided by the sale of the paging and two way businesses  if the company is successful in closing these sales  together with the million of cash on hand will be adequate to meet its anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months although additional financing will likely be necessary to complete any acquisitions during during fiscal  management estimates that it will need approximately million to

there can be no assurance  however  that we will be successful in selling the assets related to the paging and two way businesses or that we will be able to secure the necessary shareholder approvals of these proposed transactions 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete any additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms 
if these sale transactions are unsuccessful  there is substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
during fiscal  the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern 
the company incurred net losses of   and  in the years ended may   and  respectively as a result of continued declines in its paging revenues 
as of may   the company had a working capital deficiency of  the company has sustained its operations primarily through continuous cost reductions 
during  the company attempted to secure additional debt financing to fund a potential acquisition and provide additional working capital to the company but was unable to do so due to the declining performance of the company s paging business 
as a result of the continued deterioration of the company s financial position and its operating results  the company now plans to sell substantially all of the assets of the company see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the sale of the company s core businesses  combined with additional financing  is expected to generate sufficient cash to enable the company to acquire a profitable and growing business that would offset the embedded overhead costs of being a public company and return the company to a state of profitability 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be successful in selling the assets related to the paging and two way businesses  or that we will be able to complete any additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms 
if the company is unable to complete the contemplated sales and acquire a profitable business  realization of a major portion of the assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet would be dependent upon continued operations of the company 
the company has been successful in its efforts to grow its two way revenues  stabilize the rate of decline in its paging business while reducing expenses in this business and reduce its overhead costs 
however  these successes have not been sufficient to overcome the loss in profitability resulting from the significant losses in the company s paging revenues over the past several years 
further  the company has been unsuccessful in securing any additional financing during the year and has continued to be unable to grow the revenues from the telemetry business 
these conditions raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern

this obligation was payable on february  at which time up to  restricted shares of common stock were to be issued in accordance with the purchase agreement 
due to certain negotiations with delta regarding certain share reductions allowable under the purchase agreement  the company did not issue any of these securities until march during march  the company and delta agreed to a net number of shares to be issued of  shares of teletouch common stock 
before the issuance of this common stock  delta informed the company of its intention to redeem of these securities in accordance with the purchase agreement  therefore  in march  the company issued  shares of

application of critical accounting policies the preceding discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon teletouch s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  teletouch evaluates its estimates and assumptions  including but not limited to those related to the impairment of long lived assets  reserves for doubtful accounts  provision for income taxes  revenue recognition and certain accrued liabilities 
teletouch bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets teletouch evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its long lived assets and certain intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from such assets 
as a result of the closure of the company s retail stores in fiscal  the company identified excess furniture and fixtures and computer equipment used previously in its retail business  classified these excess assets as assets held for sale and recorded a charge to reduce the carrying value of these assets to their estimated recoverable value less any anticipated disposition costs 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company reduced the carrying value of these assets classified as assets held for sale from million to million by recording a charge of million to restructuring expense 
at may   all such assets held for sale had been disposed of by the company 
teletouch s review of the carrying value of its long lived assets at may  indicates that the carrying value of these assets is recoverable through future estimated cash flows 
if the cash flow estimates  or the significant operating assumptions upon which they are based  change in the future  teletouch may be required to record additional impairment charges related to its long lived assets 

table of contents 
index to financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts estimates are used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on historic collection experience  current trends and a percentage of the accounts receivable aging categories 
in determining these percentages teletouch reviews historical write offs  including comparisons of write offs to provisions for doubtful accounts and as a percentage of revenues  teletouch compares the ratio of the allowance for doubtful accounts to gross receivables to historic levels and teletouch monitors collections amounts and statistics 
teletouch s allowance for doubtful accounts was million as of may  while write offs of customer accounts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  management cannot guarantee that teletouch will continue to experience the same write off rates that it has in the past which could result in material differences in the allowance for doubtful accounts and related provisions for write offs 
reserve for inventory obsolescence estimates are used in determining the reserve for inventory obsolescence and are based on sales trends  a ratio of inventory to revenue  and a review of specific categories of inventory 
in establishing its reserve  teletouch reviews historic inventory obsolescence experience including comparisons of previous write offs to provision for inventory obsolescence and the inventory count compared to recent sales trends 
teletouch s reserve for inventory obsolescence was million as of may  prior to fiscal  inventory obsolescence has been within our expectations and the provision established 
during fiscal  the company recorded additional reserves for inventory obsolescence to recognize the deterioration in the market value of certain pager  cellular and electronics and telemetry inventory 
pager inventory was impaired primarily due to a decline in market value of certain damaged pagers that are repaired by the company 
cellular and electronic inventory became impaired after many months of attempting to sell off this excess equipment and the company recorded a reserve equaling the total value of this inventory 
certain telemetry inventory  primarily related to the company s fixed monitoring product line  was impaired subsequent to the company exiting this business line 
teletouch management cannot guarantee that the company will continue to experience the same obsolescence rates that it has in the past which could result in material differences in the reserve for inventory obsolescence and the related inventory write offs 
provision for income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  using the asset and liability approach  which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of such assets and liabilities 
this method utilizes enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse and gives immediate effect to changes in income tax rates upon enactment 
deferred tax assets are recognized  net of any valuation allowance  for temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred income tax expense represents the change in net deferred assets and liability balances 
deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities recognized for differences between the financial statement and tax basis thereon  and for the expected future tax benefits to be derived from net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be unrealizable in future periods 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

the sfas no 
goodwill impairment model is a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill assigned to its carrying value 
the fair value of a reporting unit using discounted cash flow analysis is estimated 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be less 
table of contents 
index to financial statements than its carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
step two allocates the fair value of the reporting unit to the reporting unit s net assets other than goodwill 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its net assets other than goodwill is considered the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is then compared to the carrying value of its goodwill 
any shortfall represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
under the guidance of sfas  companies are required to test for impairment of intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually 
teletouch s only intangible asset with an indefinite life is goodwill which was acquired in january as part of the purchase of the two way radio assets of delta communications  inc see note 
the company decided to test this goodwill annually on march st  the first day of its fourth fiscal quarter  of each year unless an event occurs that would cause the company to believe the value is impaired at an interim date 
using the sfas no 
approach described in the previous paragraph  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge during the fourth quarter of fiscal of  presented as an operating expense which resulted primarily from a decline in the profitability of our dallas fort worth two way radio operations within the two way radio reporting segment of the company 
the goodwill impairment was recorded due to the decreased sales in our logic trunked radio ltr sales resulting from increased competition in the market from other two way radio provider and cellular companies  lower demand for these services and limited sales staff during the year focusing on this portion of the business 
the reduced ltr sales activity was not significant to the operations of the business during the any quarter during the year  although the cumulative effect of the impact on the ltr subscriber base results in lower future cash flow projections than the company anticipated upon acquiring the business which in turn results in a reduced fair market value of the assets of the reporting segment 
the company continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable 
in evaluating impairment  we estimate the sum of the expected future cash flows derived from such goodwill 
such evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of future revenues  costs and expenses and other factors 
a significant change in cash flows in the future could result in an additional impairment of goodwill 
revenue recognition teletouch s revenue consists primarily of monthly service and lease revenues charged to customers on a monthly  quarterly  semi annual or annual basis 
deferred revenue represents prepaid monthly service fees paid by customers 
revenue also includes sales of messaging devices and other products directly to customers and resellers 
teletouch recognizes revenue over the period the service is performed in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
teletouch believes  relative to sales of products  that all of these conditions are met  therefore  product revenue is recognized at the time of shipment

additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  that we have not identified as risks  or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
as discussed throughout this filing there is substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern if it is unable to complete the sale of its paging and two way radio businesses as contemplated 
the following operational risks are included to discuss the factors that may impact the company in the normal course of business 
the operational and industry risks described below should be read understanding the overall risk to the company that it may be unable to complete the sale transactions due to any or all of the following the sale of the paging business is contingent on shareholder approval 
both the common shareholder and the holder of certain redeemable common stock warrants must vote separately to approve this transaction 
the sale of the paging business will trigger an acceleration of amounts due under the company s redeemable common stock warrants 
the amount that will become due immediately upon the sale of the business could equal the full redemption value of the warrants which is  unless the company is successful in negotiating a lesser payment with the holder of the warrants 
the company s negotiating position with the holders of the redeemable common stock warrants is limited due to their ability to block the sale transaction through the exercise of their voting rights discussed above

index to financial statements if the sale transactions are unable to be completed  the company would be faced with running the paging and two way business in an aggressive manner to generate sufficient cash to offset the cost of maintaining its status as a public company 
this manner of reducing expenses to maximize cash flows would have a negative impact on revenues and limit the viability of the company going forward 
operational risks arch wireless and metrocall wireless merger could result in increased attrition of teletouch subscribers 
the merger of arch wireless and metrocall wireless  the paging industry s two largest carriers and direct competitors of teletouch  into the new entity usa mobility during november could result in further deterioration in market pricing of paging services  and increased competition from this newly combined entity in rural markets in which teletouch operates could result in increased attrition of teletouch subscribers 
teletouch may be unable to secure the financing needed for future acquisitions teletouch may be unable to secure financing or only be presented with financing options that contain unfavorable terms to finance future acquisitions 
if financing is unavailable to the company  teletouch will be unable to complete future acquisitions and would then be forced to grow its revenues from its existing businesses  which to date has proved difficult without adequate capital funding 
teletouch must continue to minimize the reduction in its subscriber base while expanding its product offerings to offset the losses in its paging service revenues 
teletouch s future revenue growth is not dependent on any single or small group subscriber base  but will continue to concentrate on business accounts and on individuals interested in continuity  quality and personal service 
as of the quarter ended may   teletouch had approximately  pagers in service as compared to approximately  and  pagers in service at may  and may   respectively 
teletouch must minimize the reduction in its subscriber base and expand its product offerings to generate revenues to offset the losses in its paging service revenues 
there is no guarantee that our future efforts in this area will decrease subscriber attrition 
any type of systems failure could reduce sales  increase costs or result in claims of liability 
despite the company s implementation of preventive safety measures  teletouch s technology is vulnerable to system failure due to such things as computer viruses  unauthorized access  energy blackouts  natural disasters  and telecommunications failures 
any system failure  accident or security breach could cause significant interruptions in our operations 
in addition  we could be subject to liability for any loss or damage to our customers data or applications or inappropriate disclosure of customers confidential information

a failure in our systems could cause delays in transmitting data  and as a result we may lose customers or face litigation that could involve material costs and distract management from operating our business as we seek to serve fleet owners  we face competition from businesses with greater financial resources  and we may be unable to compete effectively with these businesses 
the existing market for wireless and mobile data solutions for the transportation industry is competitive 
competition is vigorous for fleet owners  which is a customer segment we seek to serve 
we expect competition to increase further as companies develop new products and or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours 
these competitors may have better name recognition  better product lines  greater sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  significantly greater financial resources  and existing relationships with some of our potential customers 
we may not be able to effectively compete with these companies 
greater financial resources and product development capabilities may allow our competitors to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements that may render our products obsolete 
in addition  these companies may reduce costs to customers and seek to obtain our customers through cost cutting and other measures 
to the extent these companies compete effectively with us  our business could be adversely affected 
any defects in teletouch s products or in those provided to us by our suppliers could expose the company to liability  damage our reputation and customer relations  and adversely affect the development and release of future products 
teletouch s products are inherently complex  therefore  it is possible that any defects contained therein may only be detectable once the product is in use 
given the critical services our products provide  these defects could have a serious adverse impact on our customers  which could damage our reputation  harm customer relations and expose us to liability 
furthermore  any product defects could require significant recalls  which may not be covered by warranty reserves 
resolving product defects could consume significant financial and engineering resources  which could adversely affect the development and release of future products 
any product defect could result in shipment delays and a decreased demand for our products  which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our level of profitability 
a reduction or interruption in component supply or a significant increase in component prices could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
our ability to meet our obligations to our customers partially depends on the timely delivery of parts and components from our suppliers and our internal capacity to install these products 
supply shortages could adversely affect our ability to satisfy our customers demands  which could damage our reputation and customer relations  in turn reducing demand for our products 
such delays or decreases in demand could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our level of profitability 
although we target smaller metropolitan areas where we believe there is less industry competition  demand for our products may be adversely affected by the presence of our competitors in these markets 
although teletouch focuses on smaller metropolitan markets  where we believe there is less competition and more opportunity for internal growth  demand for our products may be adversely affected by 
table of contents 
index to financial statements industry competitors 
teletouch currently faces competition in these markets and expects that competition to increase 
some of our competitors have more extensive engineering  manufacturing and marketing capabilities and greater financial  technical and personnel resources than we do 
furthermore  teletouch s competitors may have greater brand recognition  broader product lines  and more established customer relations 
our success depends on the introduction and acceptance of new products 
the telecommunications market is constantly changing due  in part  to technological advances  evolving industry standards and the development of new products 
teletouch s future success will depend on our ability to keep up with these changes by developing new products with a high market demand 
the company expends significant resources on research and development in its telemetry business to design new products and product enhancements to respond to the ever changing market demands 
if we fail to develop such products in response to market demands  we could fail to obtain an adequate return on our investments and could lose market share to our competitors 
failure to develop new  in demand products in a cost efficient manner could reduce the company s growth potential or adversely affect our business operations 
we face risks inherent in new product and service offerings as well as new markets 
from time to time we introduce new products and services or expand our previous product and service offerings to our existing and target markets 
our products must therefore be considered in light of the risks  expenses  problems and delays inherent in establishing new lines of business in a rapidly changing industry 
although we believe we can successfully differentiate our product and service offerings from others in the marketplace  we must be able to compete against other companies who may already be established in the marketplace and have greater resources 
there can be no assurance we will be successful in adding products or services or expanding into new markets or that our administrative  operational  infrastructure and financial resources and systems will be adequate to accommodate such offerings or expansion 
teletouch may be unsuccessful in obtaining and enforcing intellectual property protection for its technology 
the company s ability to compete with industry competitors depends in part on its ability to enforce its intellectual property rights such as trademarks and to obtain and enforce future intellectual property protection  including patents  trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets 
if we determine that our intellectual property rights have been infringed or if we are notified that we are infringing upon certain intellectual property rights  the company may become involved in litigation 
such litigation or claims could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources 
furthermore  an adverse result in an action against the company may require that we pay substantial damages  cease sales of the infringing product or technology and expend significant resources to either license the infringing technology or develop a non infringing product or technology 
we cannot give any assurance that such technology would be available to us on reasonable terms or that we would be able to develop similar non infringing technology or products

compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses and delisting of our common stock 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and amex rules  have required most public companies  including our company  to devote additional internal and external resources to various governance and compliance matters 
because we have a relatively small corporate staff  we rely heavily on outside professional advisers to assist us with these efforts 
as a result  we incurred additional operating expenses in and will incur further expenses in the future 
these future costs will include increased accounting related fees associated with preparing the attestation report on our internal controls over financial reporting as required under section of the sarbanes oxley act of in addition  these new or changed laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations  as well as modifications by the government and amex 
the way in which they are applied and implemented may change over time  which could result in even higher costs to address and implement revisions to compliance including disclosure and governance practices 
our failure to meet these corporate governance requirements may result in delisting of our common stock from amex 
industry risks our products are subject to government regulation 
radio communications are subject to regulation by the government 
teletouch s products and technology must conform to domestic rules and regulations established to avoid interference among users and facilitate interconnection of telecommunications systems 
it is our opinion that our products and technology are in compliance with all currently existing government rules and regulations 
however  new rules or regulations could adversely affect our business by requiring that current products or technology be modified to comply with such rules or regulations or by rendering current products or technology obsolete 
furthermore  teletouch cannot predict if and when new rules or regulations will come into effect 
regulatory changes could adversely affect our business by restricting our development of our products and increasing the opportunity for additional competition 
the federal communications commission the fcc must approve renewal applications for teletouch s radio licenses 
the fcc grants radio licenses for varying terms of up to years  and the fcc must approve renewal applications 
in the past  the fcc renewal applications have been more or less routinely granted 
however  there can be no assurance that the fcc will approve or act upon teletouch s future applications in a timely manner 
delays in or denial of our renewal applications could adversely affect our business operations  which could reduce our revenues and decrease our level of profitability

index to financial statements future applications by teletouch for additional transmitter sites to expand our coverage on existing frequencies must be approved by the fcc 
teletouch regularly applies to the fcc to use additional frequencies and to add additional transmitter sites to expand coverage on existing frequencies 
under current fcc guidelines  we can expand our coverage and add additional sites only on frequencies formerly classified as pcp frequencies below mhz 
all other paging frequencies below mhz on which teletouch holds licenses are frozen in a status quo condition pending the final announcement and implementation of geographic area licensing auctions 
in addition  fcc approval is required for the company s acquisitions of radio licenses held by other companies  as well as transfers of controlling interests of any entities that hold radio licenses 
teletouch cannot be sure that the fcc will approve or act upon the company s future applications in a timely manner 
denial or delayed approval by the fcc could affect our business operations  which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our level of profitability 
also  all major modification and expansion applications are subject to competitive bidding procedures 
teletouch cannot predict the impact that these procedures will have on its licensing practices
