item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
executive summary of consolidated results of operations year ended december  in millions  except per share data net income attributed to utility group nonregulated group corporate other basic earnings per share attributed to utility group nonregulated group corporate other results for the year ended december   reported earnings were million  or per share compared to million  or per share  in and million  or in the company experienced significant earnings growth from its energy marketing and services  coal mining  and utility infrastructure services nonregulated businesses during and earnings from utility operations were slightly lower in due largely to mild weather in  offset somewhat by customer growth and the effects of gas base rate increases at two of the three utilities 
mild weather also impacted results compared to  along with the write off of an investment 
while earnings have slightly decreased  earnings per share was further affected by an equity offering of million shares in august of the additional shares diluted earnings per share in as compared to by and in as compared to by 
the equity offering netted proceeds of approximately million 
the utility group generates revenue primarily from the delivery of natural gas and electric service to its customers 
the primary source of cash flow for the utility group results from the collection of customer bills and the payment for goods and services procured for the delivery of gas and electric services 
the results of the utility group are impacted by weather patterns in its service territory and general economic conditions both in its indiana and ohio service territories as well as nationally 
the nonregulated group generates revenue or earnings from the provision of services to customers 
the activities of the nonregulated group are closely linked to the utility industry  and the results of those operations are generally impacted by factors similar to those impacting the overall utility industry 
the company has in place a disclosure committee that consists of senior management as well as financial management 
the committee is actively involved in the preparation and review of the company s sec filings 
dividends dividends declared for the year ended december   were per share compared to per share in and per share in in october  the company s board of directors increased its quarterly dividend to per share from per share 
detailed discussion of results of operations following is a more detailed discussion of the results of operations of the company s utility group and nonregulated group 
the detailed results of operations for the utility group and nonregulated group are presented and analyzed before the reclassification and elimination of certain intersegment transactions necessary to consolidate those results into the company s consolidated statements of income 
corporate and other operations are not significant 
results of operations of the utility group the utility group is comprised of vectren utility holdings  inc s operations  which consist of the company s regulated operations and other operations that provide information technology and other support services to those regulated operations 
the company segregates its regulated operations into a gas utility services operating segment and an electric utility services operating segment 
the gas utility services segment provides natural gas distribution and transportation services to nearly two thirds of indiana and to west central ohio 
the electric utility services segment provides electric distribution services primarily to southwestern indiana  and includes the company s power generating and marketing operations 
in total  these regulated operations supply natural gas and or electricity to nearly one million customers 
the results of operations of the utility group before certain intersegment eliminations and reclassifications for the years ended december    and  follow year ended december  in millions  except per share data operating revenues gas utility   electric utility other total operating revenues    operating expenses cost of gas sold fuel for electric generation purchased electric energy other operating depreciation amortization taxes other than income taxes total operating expenses    operating income other income expense other net equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates total other income interest expense income before income taxes income taxes net income basic earnings per share in  utility group earnings were million as compared to million in the earnings decline is due to the impact of unfavorable weather  estimated at million after tax  or per share 
margin growth  offsetting the weather impact  results from the recovery of nox related environmental expenditures  gas base rate increases implemented in  and customer growth 
the primary expense changes were higher depreciation and lower bad debt expense in bad debt expense in associated with the ohio service territory was reversed and deferred for later recovery under an uncollectible accounts expense rider 
the million decrease in earnings occurring in compared to was primarily due to increased operating expenses and the write off of an investment  partially offset by increased wholesale power margins and retail electric rate recovery related to nox compliance expenditures 
an increase in the indiana state income tax rate to from also contributed to the decrease 
during and  the company initiated base rate cases in its three gas service territories 
orders in its two indiana service territories were received in the second half of an order in the ohio territory is expected late in the first quarter of on an annual basis  the indiana orders will increase margins an estimated million  and during provided additional margin of million 
the company has sought and received regulatory recovery mechanisms trackers affecting electric margin that provide a return on utility plant constructed for environmental compliance and that allow for recovery of related operating expenses 
after tax earnings associated with the nox compliance trackers totaled million in  million in and million in the company has also utilized regulatory trackers affecting gas margin that recover  on a dollar for dollar basis  pipeline integrity management costs in its indiana territories and uncollectible accounts expense  operating expenses related to choice implementation costs  and other costs in its ohio service territory 
throughout this discussion  the terms gas utility margin and electric utility margin are used 
gas utility margin and electric utility margin could be considered non gaap measures of income 
gas utility margin is calculated as gas utility revenues less the cost of gas 
electric utility margin is calculated as electric utility revenues less fuel for electric generation and purchased electric energy 
these measures exclude other operating expenses  depreciation and amortization  and taxes other than income taxes  which are included in the calculation of operating income 
the company believes gas utility and electric utility margins are better indicators of relative contribution than revenues since gas prices and fuel costs can be volatile and are generally collected on a dollar for dollar basis from customers 
margins should not be considered an alternative to  or a more meaningful indicator of  operating performance than operating income or net income as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
significant fluctuations utility group margin margin generated from the sale of natural gas and electricity to residential and commercial customers is seasonal and impacted by weather patterns in the company s service territories 
margin generated from sales to large customers generally industrial  other contract  and firm wholesale customers is primarily impacted by overall economic conditions 
margin is also impacted by the collection of state mandated taxes  which fluctuate with gas costs  and is also impacted by some level of price sensitivity in volumes sold 
electric generating asset optimization activities are primarily affected by market conditions  the level of excess generating capacity  and electric transmission availability 
following is a discussion and analysis of margin generated from regulated utility operations 
gas utility margin gas utility revenues less cost of gas sold gas utility margin and throughput by customer type follows year ended december  in millions residential commercial contract other total gas utility margin sold transported volumes in mmdth to residential commercial customers to contract customers total throughput gas utility margins were million for the year ended december  this represents a decrease in gas utility margin of million compared to heating weather for the year ended december   was warmer than normal and warmer than the prior year 
the estimated unfavorable impact on gas utility margin caused by weather was approximately million compared to indiana base rate increases added million compared to the prior year 
also offsetting the effects of weather were increased late and reconnect fees  expense recovery pursuant to ohio regulatory trackers  and higher revenue taxes collected from rate payers 
gas sold and transported volumes were less in  compared to the prior year 
the decreased throughput was primarily attributable to weather 
the average cost per dekatherm of gas purchased was in  in  and in gas utility margin for the year ended december   of million increased million  or  compared to it is estimated that weather near normal for the year and cooler than the prior year  contributed million in increased residential and commercial margin and was the primary contributor to increased throughput compared to the remaining increase is primarily attributable to million in higher revenue taxes on higher gas costs and volumes sold and million in recovery of ohio customer choice implementation costs 
electric utility margin electric utility revenues less fuel for electric generation and purchased electric energy electric utility margin by revenue type follows year ended december  in millions residential commercial industrial municipalities other total retail firm wholesale asset optimization total electric utility margin retail firm wholesale margin native load and firm wholesale margin was million for the year ended december  this represents a million increase over additional nox recoveries increased margin million in cooling weather for the year was warmer than last year  increasing margin an estimated million 
the remaining increase in margin was attributable to increased small customer usage and increased sales to industrial customers 
due to the above factors  volumes sold increased to gwh for  compared to gwh in volumes sold in were gwh 
for the year ended december   margin from serving native load and firm wholesale customers was million  a decrease of million when compared to it is estimated that summer weather  cooler than normal and cooler than  caused an million decrease in residential and commercial margin 
the effect of weather was partially offset by a million increase in retail electric rates related to recovery of and return on nox compliance expenditures and related operating expenses 
a slowly recovering economy continued to negatively impact industrial sales which decreased million compared to as a result of primarily mild weather and slow economic conditions  retail and firm wholesale volumes sold decreased 
margin from asset optimization activities periodically  generation capacity is in excess of that needed to serve native load and firm wholesale customers 
the company markets this unutilized capacity to optimize the return on its owned generation assets 
substantially all of the margin from these activities is generated from contracts that are integrated with portfolio requirements around power supply and delivery and are short term purchase and sale transactions that expose the company to limited market risk 
following is a reconciliation of asset optimization activity year ended december  in millions beginning of year net asset optimization position statement of income activity mark to market gains losses recognized realized gains recognized net activity in electric utility margin net cash received other adjustments end of year net asset optimization position net wholesale margins decreased million compared to due to reduced available capacity 
the availability of excess capacity was impacted by scheduled outages of owned generation  related to the installation of environmental compliance equipment and an increase in demand by native load customers due to both weather and increased usage 
the million increase in compared to was primarily due to price volatility and additional capacity due to weather 
utility group operating expenses other operating other operating expenses increased million for the year ended december  as compared to expense in reflects the deferral of million relating to the ohio order allowing the company to defer for future recovery its actual bad debt expense in excess of the amount provided in base rates see rate and regulatory matters below 
other factors contributing to the increase were an increase in nox related expenses of million recovered in rates and planned turbine maintenance of million 
other operating expense increased million in compared to the increase was principally caused by increased distribution  plant  and transmission operating expenses  power plant and other maintenance  customer service initiatives  higher insurance premiums  and prior year insurance recoveries 
in addition  operating expenses reflect million in amortization of ohio choice implementation costs  which are recovered through increased gas utility margin 
the increase in operating expenses was partially offset by the impact of an ohio regulatory order  which resulted in the reversal and deferral of uncollectible accounts expense of million for future recovery 
depreciation amortization for the year ended december   depreciation expense increased million compared to nox related depreciation contributed million of the increase with the remaining increase due primarily to normal additions to utility plant 
the increase of million in compared to is also due to normal additions to utility plant 
in addition to the nox scrubbers placed into service in  other significant expenditures included upgrades of electric facilities subjected to storm damage  construction of a new substation  and a new transmission main 
upgrades implemented in and now included in annual depreciation expense include a gas fired peaker unit  expenditures for implementing a choice program for ohio gas customers  customer system upgrades  and other upgrades to existing transmission and distribution facilities 
taxes other than income taxes taxes other than income taxes increased million in compared to and million in compared to almost all of the increase and million of the increase corresponds with increased collections of utility receipts and excise taxes due to higher revenues 
the remaining increase results principally from higher property taxes 
utility group other income expense total other income expense net increased million during compared to and decreased million during compared to lower amounts of afudc were recorded in as nox expenditures were placed in service 
fiscal year includes operating losses and the write off of investments in an entity that processes fly ash  totaling million 
in  the company recognized losses associated with those investments totaling million 
utility group interest expense in the second half of  the company completed permanent financing transactions in which approximately million in equity  debt  and hedging net proceeds were received and used to retire higher coupon long term debt and other short term borrowings 
the changes in interest expense in and reflect the full impact of that transaction 
utility group income taxes for the year ended december   income taxes were relatively consistent with with decreased earnings offset by a slightly higher effective rate 
an increase in the indiana state income tax rate from to was the primary reason for increased tax expense in compared to environmental matters the company is subject to federal  state  and local regulations with respect to environmental matters  principally air  solid waste  and water quality 
pursuant to environmental regulations  the company is required to obtain operating permits for the electric generating plants that it owns or operates and construction permits for any new plants it might propose to build 
regulations concerning air quality establish standards with respect to both ambient air quality and emissions from electric generating facilities  including particulate matter  sulfur dioxide so  and nitrogen oxide nox 
regulations concerning water quality establish standards relating to intake and discharge of water from electric generating facilities  including water used for cooling purposes in electric generating facilities 
because of the scope and complexity of these regulations  the company is unable to predict the ultimate effect of such regulations on its future operations  nor is it possible to predict what other regulations may be adopted in the future 
the company intends to comply with all applicable governmental regulations  but will contest any regulation it deems to be unreasonable or impossible with which to comply 
clean air act nox sip call matter the company has taken steps to comply with indiana s state implementation plan sip of the clean air act the act 
these steps include installing selective catalytic reduction scr systems at culley generating station unit culley  warrick generating station unit  and ab brown generating station units and scr systems reduce flue gas nox emissions to atmospheric nitrogen and water using ammonia in a chemical reaction 
this technology is known to currently be the most effective method of reducing nitrogen oxide nox emissions where high removal efficiencies are required 
the iurc has issued orders that approve o the company s project to achieve environmental compliance by investing in clean coal technology  o a total capital cost investment for this project up to million excluding afudc  subject to periodic review of the actual costs incurred  o a mechanism whereby  prior to an electric base rate case  the company may recover through a rider that is updated every six months  an return on its weighted capital costs for the project  and o ongoing recovery of operating costs  including depreciation and purchased emission allowances  related to the clean coal technology once the facility is placed into service 
based on the level of system wide emissions reductions required and the control technology utilized to achieve the reductions  the current estimated construction cost is consistent with amounts approved in the iurc s orders 
through december   million has been expended  and three of the four scr s are operational 
once all equipment is installed and operational  related annual operating expenses  including depreciation expense  are estimated to be between million and million 
the company is recovering the operational costs associated with the scr s and related technology 
the return on capital investment approximates the return authorized in the company s last electric rate case in and includes a return on equity 
the company has achieved timely compliance through the reduction of the company s overall nox emissions to levels compliant with indiana s nox emissions budget allotted by the usepa 
therefore  the company has recorded no accrual for potential penalties that may result from noncompliance 
culley generating station litigation during  the us district court for the southern district of indiana entered a consent decree among sigeco  the department of justice doj  and the usepa that resolved a lawsuit originally brought by the usepa against sigeco 
the lawsuit alleged violations of the clean air act by sigeco at its culley generating station for making modifications to generating station without obtaining required permits  making major modifications to the generating station without installing the best available emission control technology  and failing to notify the usepa of the modifications 
under the terms of the agreement  the doj and usepa agreed to drop all challenges of past maintenance and repair activities at the culley generating station 
in reaching the agreement  sigeco did not admit to any allegations in the government s complaint  and sigeco continues to believe that it acted in accordance with applicable regulations and conducted only routine maintenance on the units 
sigeco entered into this agreement to further its continued commitment to improve air quality and avoid the cost and uncertainties of litigation 
under the agreement  sigeco committed to o either repower culley unit mw with natural gas and equip it with scr control technology for further reduction of nitrogen oxide  or cease operation of the unit by december   o operate the existing scr control technology recently installed on culley unit mw year round at a lower emission rate than that currently required under the nox sip call  resulting in further nitrogen oxide reductions  o enhance the efficiency of the existing scrubber at culley units and for additional removal of sulphur dioxide emissions  o install a baghouse for further particulate matter reductions at culley unit by june   o conduct a sulphuric acid reduction demonstration project as an environmental mitigation project designed to demonstrate an advance in pollution control technology for the reduction of sulfate emissions  and o pay a  civil penalty 
the company notified the usepa of its intention to shut down culley unit effective december  the company does not believe that implementation of the settlement will have a material effect to its results from operations or financial condition 
the  civil penalty was expensed and paid during and is reflected in other net 
information request on january   sigeco received an information request from the usepa under section of the clean air act for historical operational information on the warrick and ab brown generating stations 
sigeco has provided all information requested with the most recent correspondence provided on march  manufactured gas plants in the past  indiana gas  sigeco  and others operated facilities for the manufacture of gas 
given the availability of natural gas transported by pipelines  these facilities have not been operated for many years 
under currently applicable environmental laws and regulations  indiana gas  sigeco  and others may now be required to take remedial action if certain byproducts are found above the regulatory thresholds at these sites 
indiana gas has identified the existence  location  and certain general characteristics of gas manufacturing and storage sites for which it may have some remedial responsibility 
indiana gas has completed a remedial investigation feasibility study ri fs at one of the sites under an agreed order between indiana gas and the idem  and a record of decision was issued by the idem in january although indiana gas has not begun an ri fs at additional sites  indiana gas has submitted several of the sites to the idem s voluntary remediation program vrp and is currently conducting some level of remedial activities  including groundwater monitoring at certain sites  where deemed appropriate  and will continue remedial activities at the sites as appropriate and necessary 
in conjunction with data compiled by environmental consultants  indiana gas has accrued the estimated costs for further investigation  remediation  groundwater monitoring  and related costs for the sites 
while the total costs that may be incurred in connection with addressing these sites cannot be determined at this time  indiana gas has recorded costs that it reasonably expects to incur totaling approximately million 
the estimated accrued costs are limited to indiana gas proportionate share of the remediation efforts 
indiana gas has arrangements in place for of the sites with other potentially responsible parties prp  which serve to limit indiana gas share of response costs at these sites to between and 
with respect to insurance coverage  indiana gas has received and recorded settlements from all known insurance carriers in an aggregate amount approximating million 
environmental matters related to manufactured gas plants have had no material impact on earnings since costs recorded to date approximate prp and insurance settlement recoveries 
while indiana gas has recorded all costs which it presently expects to incur in connection with activities at these sites  it is possible that future events may require some level of additional remedial activities which are not presently foreseen 
in october  the company received a formal information request letter from the idem regarding five manufactured gas plants owned and or operated by sigeco and not currently enrolled in the idem s vrp 
in response  sigeco submitted to the idem the results of preliminary site investigations conducted in the mid s 
these site investigations confirmed that based upon the conditions known at the time  the sites posed no risk to human health or the environment 
follow up reviews have been initiated by the company to confirm that the sites continue to pose no such risk 
on october   sigeco filed applications to enter four of the manufactured gas plant sites in idem s vrp 
the remaining site is currently being addressed in the vrp by another indiana utility 
sigeco added those four sites into the renewal of the global voluntary remediation agreement that indiana gas has in place with idem for its manufactured gas plant sites 
that renewal was approved by the idem on february  on july   sigeco filed a declaratory judgment action against its insurance carriers seeking a judgment finding its carriers liable under the policies for coverage of further investigation and any necessary remediation costs that sigeco may accrue under the vrp program 
the total investigative costs  and if necessary  costs of remediation at the four sigeco sites  as well as the amount of any prp or insurance recoveries  cannot be determined at this time 
jacobsville superfund site on july   the usepa listed the jacobsville neighborhood soil contamination site in evansville  indiana  on the national priorities list under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla 
the usepa has identified four sources of historic lead contamination 
these four sources shut down manufacturing operations years ago 
when drawing up the boundaries for the listing  the usepa included a acre block of properties surrounding the jacobsville neighborhood  including vectren s wagner operations center 
vectren s property has not been named as a source of the lead contamination  nor does the usepa s soil testing to date indicate that the vectren property contains lead contaminated soils 
vectren s own soil testing  completed during the construction of the operations center  did not indicate that the vectren property contains lead contaminated soils 
at this time  vectren anticipates only additional soil testing  if required by the usepa 
rate and regulatory matters gas and electric operations with regard to retail rates and charges  terms of service  accounting matters  issuance of securities  and certain other operational matters specific to its indiana customers are regulated by the iurc 
the retail gas operations of the ohio operations are subject to regulation by the puco 
all metered gas rates in indiana contain a gas cost adjustment gca clause  and all metered gas rates in ohio contain a gas cost recovery gcr clause 
gca and gcr clauses allow the company to charge for changes in the cost of purchased gas 
metered electric rates contain a fuel adjustment clause fac that allows for adjustment in charges for electric energy to reflect changes in the cost of fuel 
the net energy cost of purchased power  subject to an agreed upon benchmark  is also recovered through regulatory proceedings 
rate structures in the company s territories do not include weather normalization type clauses that authorize the utility to recover gross margin on sales established in its last general rate case  regardless of actual weather patterns 
gca  gcr  and fac procedures involve periodic filings and iurc and puco hearings to establish the amount of price adjustments for a designated future period 
the procedures also provide for inclusion in later periods of any variances between the estimated cost of gas  cost of fuel  and net energy cost of purchased power and actual costs incurred 
the company records any under or over recovery resulting from gas and fuel adjustment clauses each month in margin 
a corresponding asset or liability is recorded until the under or over recovery is billed or refunded to utility customers 
the iurc has also applied the statute authorizing gca and fac procedures to reduce rates when necessary to limit net operating income to a level authorized in its last general rate order through the application of an earnings test 
for the recent past  the earnings test has not affected the company s ability to recover costs  and the company does not anticipate the earnings test will restrict recovery in the near future 
sigeco and indiana gas base rate settlements on june   the iurc approved a million base rate increase for sigeco s gas distribution business  and on november   approved a million base rate increase for indiana gas gas distribution business 
the new rate designs include a larger service charge  which is intended to address to some extent earnings volatility related to weather 
the base rate change in sigeco s service territory was implemented on july   resulting in additional revenues of million 
the base rate change in indiana gas service territory was implemented on december   resulting in additional revenues of million 
the orders also permit sigeco and indiana gas to recover the on going costs to comply with the federal pipeline safety improvement act of the pipeline safety improvement tracker provides for the recovery of incremental non capital dollars  capped at  the first year and  thereafter for sigeco and million per year for indiana gas 
any costs incurred in excess of these annual caps are to be deferred for future recovery 
vedo pending base rate increase settlement on february   the company filed with the puco a settlement agreement that had been entered into with several parties  including the puco staff  in its base rate case 
the ohio office of the consumer counselor occ is opposing the settlement 
earlier in vedo had filed with the puco a request to adjust its base rates and charges for its gas distribution business serving more than  customers located in west central ohio 
the settlement provides for a million increase in vedo s base distribution rates to cover the ongoing costs of operating  maintaining  and expanding the approximately  mile distribution system 
the settlement increase includes million of funding for weatherization and conservation programs for low income customers 
evidentiary hearings were completed in the case on february  review and approval by the puco is necessary before the settlement is effective 
the proposed new rate design includes a larger service charge  which will address  to some extent  earnings volatility related to weather 
the settlement also permits vedo the annual recovery of on going costs associated with the pipeline safety improvement act of based upon the puco s actions in other proceedings  the company would expect an order near the end of the first quarter of ohio uncollectible accounts expense tracker on december   the puco approved a request by vedo and several other regulated ohio gas utilities to establish a mechanism to recover uncollectible account expense outside of base rates 
the tariff mechanism establishes an automatic adjustment procedure to track and recover these costs instead of providing the recovery of the historic amount in base rates 
through this order  vedo received authority to defer its uncollectible accounts expense to the extent it differs from the level included in base rates 
the company estimated the difference to approximate million in excess of that included in base rates  and reversed and deferred that amount for future recovery 
in  the company recorded revenues of million which is equal to the level of uncollectible accounts expense recognized for ohio residential customers 
gas cost recovery gcr audit proceedings there is an ohio requirement that ohio gas utilities undergo a biannual audit of their gas acquisition practices in connection with the gas cost recovery gcr mechanism 
in the case of vedo  a two year audit period ended in november that audit period provided the puco staff its initial review of the portfolio administration arrangement between vedo and proliance 
the external auditor retained by the puco staff submitted an audit report in the fall of wherein it recommended a disallowance of approximately million of previously recovered gas costs 
the company believes a large portion of the third party auditor recommendations is without merit 
a hearing has been held  and the puco staff has recommended a million disallowance 
the ohio consumer counselor has recommended an million disallowance 
for this puco audit period  any disallowance relating to the company s proliance arrangement will be shared by the company s joint venture partner 
based on a review of the matters  the company has recorded million for its estimated share of a potential disallowance 
a puco decision on this matter is yet to be issued 
the company is also unable to determine the effects that a puco decision for the audit period ended in november may have on results in audit periods beginning after november other operating matters miso the ferc approved the midwest independent system operator miso as the nation s first regional transmission organization 
regional transmission organizations place public utility transmission facilities in a region under common control 
the miso is committed to reliability  the nondiscriminatory operation of the bulk power transmission system  and to working with all stakeholders to create cost effective and innovative solutions 
the carmel  indiana  based miso began operations in december and serves the electrical transmission needs of much of the midwest 
in december  the iurc approved the company s request for authority to transfer operational control over its electric transmission facilities to the miso 
that transfer occurred on february  pursuant to an order from the iurc  certain miso costs have been deferred for future recovery 
during  sigeco together with three other indiana electric utilities filed a proceeding with the iurc seeking to recover the anticipated costs associated with miso s implementation of the day energy market on april  a hearing considering this request occurred in february  as a result of miso s operational control over much of the midwestern electric transmission grid  including sigeco s transmission facilities  sigeco s continued ability to import power  when necessary  and export power to the wholesale market has been  and may continue to be  impacted 
given the nature of miso s policies regarding use of transmission facilities  as well as ongoing ferc initiatives and uncertainties around the day energy market operations  it is difficult to predict near term operational impacts 
however  as stated above  it is believed that miso s regional operation of the transmission system will ultimately lead to reliability improvements 
the potential need to expend capital for improvements to the transmission system  both to sigeco s facilities as well as to those facilities of adjacent utilities  over the next several years will become more predictable as miso completes studies related to regional transmission planning and improvements 
such expenditures may be significant 
united states securities and exchange commission inquiry into pucha exemption in july  the company received a letter from the sec regarding its exempt status under the public utility holding company act of puhca 
the letter asserts that vectren s out of state electric power sales exceed the amount previously determined by the sec to be acceptable in order to qualify for the exemption 
there is pending a request by vectren for an order of exemption under section a of puhca 
vectren also claims the benefit of the exemption pursuant to rule under section a of puhca by filing an annual statement on sec form u a the company has responded to the sec inquiry and filed an amended form u a for the year ended december  the amendment changed the method of aggregating wholesale power sales and purchases outside of indiana from that previously reported 
the new method is to aggregate by delivery point 
the amendment also submitted clarifications as to activity outside of indiana related to gas utility operations 
results of operations of the nonregulated group the nonregulated group is comprised of four primary business areas energy marketing and services  coal mining  utility infrastructure services  and broadband 
energy marketing and services markets and supplies natural gas and provides energy management services  including energy performance contracting services 
coal mining mines and sells coal and generates irs code section investment tax credits relating to the production of coal based synthetic fuels 
utility infrastructure services provides underground construction and repair  facilities locating  and meter reading services 
broadband has investments in broadband communication services such as analog and digital cable television  high speed internet and data services  and advanced local and long distance phone services 
in addition  the nonregulated group has other businesses that invest in energy related opportunities  real estate  and leveraged leases  among other activities 
the nonregulated group supports the company s regulated utilities pursuant to service contracts by providing natural gas supply services  coal  utility infrastructure services  and other services 
corporate expenses are allocated to each business area 
the results of operations of the nonregulated group for the years ended december    and  follow year ended december  in millions  except per share amounts net income basic earnings per share net income attributed to energy marketing services coal mining utility infrastructure broadband other businesses nonregulated earnings for the year ended december   were million compared to million in and million in the company s three core nonregulated businesses  energy marketing and services  coal mining  and utility infrastructure services  contributed million in  compared to million in and million in the results reflect million in after tax charges related to the write down of the company s broadband businesses 
those charges were partially offset by net gains from the company s investment in haddington energy partners 
earnings in reflect after tax gains from the divesture of businesses and investments totaling million after tax 
energy marketing services energy marketing and services is comprised of the company s gas marketing operations  performance contracting operations  and retail gas supply operations 
gas marketing operations are performed through the company s investment in proliance energy llc proliance  a nonregulated energy marketing affiliate of vectren and citizens gas and coke utility citizens gas 
proliance s primary businesses include gas marketing  gas portfolio optimization  and other portfolio and energy management services 
proliance s primary customers include vectren s utilities and nonregulated gas supply operations as well as citizen s gas and other large end use customers 
as part of a settlement agreement approved by the iurc during july  the gas supply agreements with indiana gas and sigeco  were approved and extended through march  the utilities may decide to conduct a request for proposal rfp for a new supply administrator  or they may decide to make an alternative proposal for procurement of gas supply 
that decision will be made by december to the extent an rfp is conducted  proliance has the opportunity  if it so elects  to participate in the rfp process for service to the utilities after march  in june  the integration of vectren s wholly owned gas marketing subsidiary  sigcorp energy services  llc ses  with proliance was completed 
ses provided natural gas and related services to sigeco and others prior to the integration 
in exchange for the contribution of ses net assets totaling million  vectren s allocable share of proliance s profits and losses increased to  consistent with vectren s new ownership percentage 
the transfer of net assets was accounted for at book value  consistent with joint venture accounting  and did not result in any gain or loss 
governance and voting rights remain at for each member  and therefore  vectren continues to account for its investment in proliance using the equity method of accounting 
energy systems group  llc esg provides energy performance contracting and facility upgrades through its design and installation of energy efficient equipment throughout the midwest 
esg acquired progress energy solutions during  expanding its operations throughout the southeast and mid atlantic united states 
prior to april  esg was a consolidated venture between the company and citizens gas with the company owning two thirds 
in april  the company purchased the remaining interest in esg 
vectren retail  llc d b a vectren source provides natural gas and other related products and services in ohio and indiana  serving just over  customers opting for choice among energy providers 
in  vectren source was certified by the georgia public service commission and has begun initial marketing efforts in the atlanta gas light company service territory 
net income generated by energy marketing and services for the year ended december   was million compared to million in and million in throughout the periods presented  gas marketing operations  performed through proliance  provided the primary earnings contribution  totaling million in and in and million in while earnings remained relatively consistent in compared to  proliance experienced increased earnings primarily related to asset optimization from storage activities as a result of significant price volatility 
however  those increases were offset by the reserve established for the contingency described below 
the increase over was principally attributable to increased storage capacity coupled with more volatile gas prices 
earnings growth has also been impacted by vectren source s operations 
vectren source  a start up operation  operated at a planned loss of million  in  as compared to a loss of million in and million in vectren source has expanded its customer base and has increased margins per unit of throughput 
earnings from performance contracting operations  performed through esg  contributed earnings of million in nearly matching last year s contribution of million 
earnings in were million 
the million increase in compared to is due primarily to higher margins and working from a higher construction backlog at the end of as well as increased ownership as of april proliance contingency in  a lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the northern district of alabama filed by the city of huntsville  alabama d b a huntsville utilities  inc huntsville utilities against proliance 
huntsville utilities asserted claims based on alleged breach of contract with respect to provision of portfolio services and or pricing advice  fraud  fraudulent inducement  and other theories  including conversion and violations under racketeering  influenced and corrupt organizations act rico 
these claims related generally to alleged breach of contract in providing advice and or administering portfolio arrangements  alleged promises to provide gas at a below market rate  the creation and repayment of a winter levelizing program instituted by proliance in conjunction with the manager of huntsville s gas utility  to allow huntsville utilities to pay its gas bills from the winter of over an extended period of time coupled with the alleged ignorance about the program on the part of huntsville utilities gas board and other management  and  the sale of huntsville utilities gas storage supplies to repay the balance owed on the winter levelizing program and the alleged lack of authority of huntsville utilities gas manager to approve those sales 
in early  a jury trial was commenced and on february   the jury returned a verdict largely in favor of huntsville utilities and awarded huntsville utilities compensatory damages of million and punitive damages of million 
the jury rejected huntsville utilities claim of conversion 
the jury also rejected proliance s counter claim for payment 
the amounts due from huntsville utilities were fully reserved by proliance in huntsville utilities claims that all or a portion of the compensatory damages may be subject to trebling under applicable federal statutes 
the court may also assess attorney s fees and costs in favor of huntsville utilities 
if the court applies trebling and awards attorney fees  the entire award could approach million 
several matters are still pending at the trial court  including efforts by proliance to reduce the amount of the verdict 
proliance will file post judgment motions to reduce and to set aside the verdict 
the court may issue its final rulings on the verdict and related motions by april or may 
depending on the outcome  proliance would appeal the judgment of the trial court 
proliance management believes that there are reasonable grounds to set aside or reduce the verdict and reasonable grounds for appeal which offer a basis for reversal of the entire verdict 
while it is reasonably possible that a liability has been incurred by proliance  it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of an appeal of the verdict 
proliance has recorded a reserve of million as of december   reflective of their assessment of the lower end of the range of possible outcomes in the case and inclusive of estimated ongoing litigation costs 
as an equity investor in proliance  the company has reflected its share of the charge  or million after tax  in its results 
it is not expected that an unfavorable outcome on appeal will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or its liquidity  but an unfavorable outcome could be material to the company s earnings 
coal mining the coal mining group mines and sells coal to the company s utility operations and to third parties through its wholly owned subsidiary vectren fuels  inc fuels 
the coal mining group also generates irs code section tax credits relating to the production of coal based synthetic fuels through its ownership interest in pace carbon synfuels  lp pace carbon 
pace carbon developed  owns  and operates four projects to produce and sell coal based synthetic fuel synfuel utilizing covol technology 
vectren accounts for its investment in pace carbon using the equity method 
in addition  fuels receives synfuel related fees from synfuel producers unrelated to pace carbon for a portion of its coal production 
coal mining net income for the year ended december   was million  as compared to million in  and million in synfuel related results  which include earnings from pace carbon and synfuel processing fees earned by fuels  were million in  million in  and million in the decrease reflects lower production of synthetic fuel produced by pace carbon due to feedstock problems at one of their four plants 
the underperforming plant was relocated and began production in january the increase is due to greater production of synthetic fuel by pace carbon 
the production of synthetic fuel generates section tax credits that are utilized by the company  reducing income tax expense in those years 
earnings from mining operations were million in compared to a loss of million in and earnings of million in increased earnings in were due primarily to improved production and market pricing which were partially offset by weather conditions and increased commodity costs  such as steel  explosives and diesel fuel 
in  mining operations experienced decreased yields due to poor mining conditions and increased mine development cost amortization compared to irs section tax credit recent developments under section of the internal revenue code  manufacturers of synthetic fuel such as pace carbon receive a tax credit for every ton of synthetic fuel sold 
to qualify for the credits  the synthetic fuel must meet three primary conditions there must be a significant chemical change in the coal feedstock  the product must be sold to an unrelated person  and the production facility must have been placed in service before july  in past rulings  the internal revenue service irs has concluded that the synthetic fuel produced at the pace carbon facilities should qualify for section tax credits 
the irs issued a private letter ruling with respect to the four projects on november   and subsequently issued an updated private letter ruling on september  as a partner in pace carbon  vectren has reflected section tax credits in its consolidated results through december   of approximately million 
to date  vectren has been in a position to fully recognize the credits generated 
during june  the irs began a tax audit of pace carbon for the tax year and later expanded the audit to include tax years   and in may  the irs completed its audit of the to tax returns of pace carbon requesting only minor modifications to previously filed returns 
there were no changes to any of the filed section tax credit calculations 
the permanent subcommittee on investigations of the us senate s committee on governmental affairs  however  has an ongoing investigation related to section tax credits 
vectren believes it is justified in its reliance on the private letter rulings and recent irs audit results for the pace carbon facilities 
therefore  the company will continue to recognize section tax credits as they are earned until there is either a change in the tax code or the irs interpretation of that tax code 
further  section tax credits are only available when the price of oil is less than a base price specified by the tax code  as adjusted for inflation 
the company does not believe that credits realized in and prior years will be affected by the limitation  but an average annual price in excess of the mid per barrel range  as priced at the wellhead  could limit section tax credits in and beyond 
in january  the company executed an insurance arrangement that partially limits the company s exposure if a limitation on the availability of tax credits were to occur in and or due to oil prices 
utility infrastructure services utility infrastructure services provides underground construction and repair to gas  water  and telecommunications companies primarily through its investment in reliant services  llc reliant and reliant s ownership in miller pipeline

in the first half of and throughout all  results were affected by cutbacks of underground construction and repair projects by gas distribution customers 
in the second half of  miller returned to profitability due to an increase in construction and repair projects as utilities began to return to historical expenditure levels 
broadband and other businesses the company has an approximate equity interest and a convertible subordinated debt investment in utilicom networks  llc utilicom that if converted bring the company s ownership interest up to 
the company also has an approximate equity interest in sigecom holdings  inc  which was formed by utilicom to hold interests in sigecom  llc sigecom 
sigecom provides broadband services  such as cable television  high speed internet  and advanced local and long distance phone services  to over  customers  averaging over revenue generating units per customer  in the greater evansville  indiana 
sigecom s operations are cash flow positive and have not required any further investment since may other utilicom related subsidiaries also owned franchising agreements to provide broadband services to the greater indianapolis  indiana and dayton  ohio markets 
in  the build out of these markets was further evaluated  and the company concluded that it was unlikely it would make additional investments in those markets 
as a result  the company recorded charges totaling million  or million after tax  to write off investments made in the indianapolis and dayton markets and to write down its investment in sigecom 
the year ended december   also includes a million after tax loss resulting from the sale of a small broadband operation located in indianapolis 
the other businesses group includes a variety of wholly owned operations and investments that invest in energy related opportunities  real estate  and leveraged leases  among other investments

impact of recently issued accounting guidance sfas revised in december  the fasb issued statement revised  share based payments sfas r that will require compensation costs related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements 
with limited exceptions  the amount of compensation cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
in addition  liability awards will be remeasured each reporting period 
compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
sfas r replaces fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the effective date of sfas r for the company is july  sfas r provides for multiple transition methods  and the company is still evaluating potential methods for adoption 
the adoption of this standard is not expected to have any material effect on the company s operating results or financial condition 
eitf in march  the eitf issued a consensus on issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf 
in eitf  the task force developed a basic model for evaluating whether investments within the scope of eitf  which includes cost method and equity method investments  have other than temporary impairment 
the basic model includes three steps determine if there is impairment  if there is impairment  decide whether it is temporary or other than temporary  and if it is other than temporary  recognize it in earnings 
eitf also requires certain qualitative and quantitative disclosure of material impairments judged to be temporary 
the eitf has yet to finalize steps and step and the disclosure requirements are currently effective  and the adoption of those portions of the eitf did not have a material effect on the company 
as noted in the broadband discussion above  the company incurred an other than temporary impairment charge associated with its cost method investment in sigecom  llc  during while the company currently believes that the book value of that investment approximates fair value  further changes in estimated fair value may occur 
critical accounting policies management is required to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures that conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain estimates used in the financial statements are subjective and use variables that require judgment 
these include the estimates to perform goodwill and other asset impairments tests and to determine pension and postretirement benefit obligations 
the company makes other estimates in the course of accounting for unbilled revenue and the effects of regulation that are critical to the company s financial results but that are less likely to be impacted by near term changes 
other estimates that significantly affect the company s results  but are not necessarily critical to operations  include depreciating utility and non utility plant  valuating of derivative contracts  and estimating uncollectible accounts  among others 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
impairment review of investments the company has investments in notes receivable  entities accounted for using the cost method of accounting  and entities accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
when events occur that may cause one of these investments to be impaired  the company performs an impairment analysis 
an impairment analysis of notes receivable usually involves the comparison of the investment s estimated free cash flows to the stated terms of the note  or for notes that are collateral dependent  a comparison of the collateral s fair value to the carrying amount of the note 
an impairment analysis of cost method and equity method investments involves comparison of the investment s estimated fair value to its carrying amount 
fair value is estimated using market comparisons  appraisals  and or discounted cash flow analyses 
calculating free cash flows and fair value using the above methods is subjective and requires judgment concerning growth assumptions  longevity of cash flows  and discount rates for fair value calculations 
during  the company performed an impairment analysis on its utilicom related investments 
the company used free cash flow analyses to estimate fair value for the cost method portion of the utilicom investment and recoverability of the related notes receivable 
an impairment charge totaling million was recorded as a result of the analysis 
a increase in the discount rate assumption utilized to calculate utilicom s fair value would have resulted in an estimated additional million impairment charge to the cost method investment and no additional impairment charge to the notes receivable 
impairment tests on other investments were also conducted using appraisals and discounted cash flow models to estimate fair value 
no impairment charges resulted from these analyses in and a million write off of investments in an entity that processes fly ash resulted in for the other impairment tests performed during  a adverse change in the calculated or appraised fair value of collateral or a basis point adverse change in the discount rate used to estimate fair value would have resulted in an approximate million impairment charge 
a adverse change of such factors would not have affected the write off 
goodwill pursuant to sfas no 
 the company performs an impairment analysis of its goodwill  almost all of which resides in the gas utility services operating segment  annually  at the beginning of each year  and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred 
impairment tests are performed at the reporting unit level which the company has determined to be consistent with its gas utility services operating segment as identified in note to the consolidated financial statements 
an impairment test performed in accordance with sfas requires that a reporting unit s fair value be estimated 
the company used a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of its gas utility services operating segment  and that estimated fair value was compared to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the estimated fair value was in excess of the carrying amount in   and and therefore resulted in no impairment 
estimating fair value using a discounted cash flow model is subjective and requires significant judgment in applying a discount rate  growth assumptions  company expense allocations  and longevity of cash flows 
a basis point increase in the discount rate utilized to calculate the gas utility services segment s fair value also would have resulted in no impairment charge 
pension and other postretirement obligations the company estimates the expected return on plan assets  discount rate  rate of compensation increase  and future health care costs  among other things  and relies on actuarial estimates to assess the future potential liability and funding requirements of the company s pension and postretirement plans 
the company annually measures its obligations on september the company used the following weighted average assumptions to develop periodic benefit cost a discount rate of  an expected return on plan assets of  a rate of compensation increase of  and a health care cost trend rate of in declining to in during  the company reduced the discount rate by basis points to value ending pension and postretirement obligations due to a decline in benchmark interest rates 
in addition  the company reduced its expected return on plan assets basis points from that used to estimate expense due to lower investment returns and changes in the economic outlook for equity returns 
pension and postretirement periodic cost has increased from approximately million in to over million in preliminary estimates of periodic cost approximated million 
in january  the company announced the amendment of certain postretirement benefit plans  effective january  the amendment will result in an estimated million annual decrease in periodic cost  a portion of which will be recognized in  reducing those preliminary estimates 
two of the unions that represent bargaining employees at the company s regulated subsidiaries have advised the company that it is their position that these changes are not permitted under the existing collective bargaining agreements which govern the relationship between the employees and the affected subsidiaries 
with assistance from legal counsel  management has analyzed the unions position and continues to believe that the company has reserved the right to amend the affected plans and that changing these benefits for retirees is not a mandatory subject of bargaining 
future changes in health care costs  work force demographics  interest rates  or plan changes could significantly affect the estimated cost of these future benefits 
for the year ended december   a one percentage point adverse change in the assumed health care cost trend rate for the postretirement health care plans would have decreased pre tax income by approximately million and would have increased the postretirement liability by approximately million 
management estimates that a basis point reduction in the expected return on plan assets would have increased periodic benefit cost by approximately million 
unbilled revenues to more closely match revenues and expenses  the company records revenues for all gas and electricity delivered to customers but not billed at the end of the accounting period 
the company uses actual units billed during the month to allocate unbilled units 
those allocated units are multiplied by rates in effect during the month to calculate unbilled revenue at balance sheet dates 
while certain estimates are used in the calculation of unbilled revenue  the method these estimates are derived from is not subject to near term changes 
regulation at each reporting date  the company reviews current regulatory trends in the markets in which it operates 
this review involves judgment and is critical in assessing the recoverability of regulatory assets as well as the ability to continue to account for its activities based on the criteria set forth in sfas no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas 
based on the company s current review  it believes its regulatory assets are probable of recovery 
if all or part of the company s operations cease to meet the criteria of sfas  a write off of related regulatory assets and liabilities could be required 
in addition  the company would be required to determine any impairment to the carrying value of its utility plant and other regulated assets 
in the unlikely event of a change in the current regulatory environment  such write offs and impairment charges could be significant

however  due to significant capital expenditures and expected growth in nonregulated operations  the company may require additional permanent financing 
sources uses of liquidity operating cash flow the company s primary historical source of liquidity to fund working capital requirements has been cash generated from operations 
cash flow from operating activities increased million during the year ended december   compared to primarily as a result of favorable changes in working capital accounts offset by decreased earnings before non cash charges 
the decreased earnings before non cash charges result principally from lower deferred tax expense due to approximately million in alternative minimum taxes recognized in  which has reduced deferred tax expense 
operating cash flow in decreased million compared to the primary reason for the decrease was the negative effect of higher gas prices on working capital  offset by increased earnings before non cash charges 
financing cash flow although working capital requirements are generally funded by cash flow from operations  the company uses short term borrowings to supplement working capital needs when accounts receivable balances are at their highest and gas storage is refilled 
additionally  short term borrowings are required for capital projects and investments until they are permanently financed 
cash flow required for financing activities of million for the year ended december   includes a net increase of short term borrowings of million and the net retirement of million of long term debt

the notes are guaranteed by the vuhi s three public utilities sigeco  indiana gas  and vedo 
these guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several 
in addition  they have no sinking fund requirements  and interest payments are due semi annually 
the notes may be called by vuhi  in whole or in part  at any time for an amount equal to accrued and unpaid interest  plus the greater of of the principal amount or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest  discounted to the redemption date on a semi annual basis at the treasury rate  as defined in the indenture  plus basis points for the notes and basis points for the notes

electric sales and purchases in the wholesale power market and other commodity related operations are exposed to commodity price risk associated with fluctuating commodity prices including electricity  natural gas  and coal 
other commodity related operations include regulated sales of electricity to certain municipalities and large industrial customers and nonregulated retail gas marketing and coal mining operations 
open positions in terms of price  volume  and specified delivery points may occur and are managed using methods described below with frequent management reporting 
the company s wholesale power marketing activities include asset optimization strategies that manage the utilization of available electric generating capacity 
execution of asset optimization strategies require entering into energy contracts that commit the company to purchase and sell electricity in the future 
commodity price risk results from forward positions that commit the company to deliver electricity 
the company mitigates price risk exposure with planned unutilized generation capability and offsetting forward purchase contracts 
the company accounts for asset optimization contracts that are derivatives at fair value with the offset marked to market through earnings 
the company s other commodity related operations involve the purchase and sale of commodities  including electricity  natural gas  and coal to meet customer demands and operational needs 
these operations also enter into forward and option contracts that commit the company to purchase and sell commodities in the future 
price risk from forward positions obligating the company to deliver commodities is mitigated using stored inventory  generating capability  and offsetting forward purchase contracts 
price risk also results from forward contracts obligating the company to purchase commodities to fulfill forecasted nonregulated sales of natural gas and coal that may  or may not  occur 
with the exception of a small portion of contracts that are derivatives that qualify as hedges of forecasted transactions under sfas  these contracts are expected to be settled by physical receipt or delivery of the commodity 
nonregulated gas retail operations will from time to time purchase weather derivatives to mitigate extreme weather affecting unregulated retail gas sales  and the company may purchase other tailored products that mitigate unique risks involving emission allowances and the effect oil prices may have on the availability of section tax credits 
market risk resulting from commodity contracts is measured by management using the potential impact on pre tax earnings caused by the effect a adverse change in forward commodity prices might have on market sensitive derivative positions outstanding on specific dates 
for the years ended december   and  a adverse change in forward commodity prices would have decreased earnings by million and million  respectively  based upon open positions existing on the last day of those years 
commodity price risk from unconsolidated affiliate proliance  a nonregulated energy marketing affiliate  engages in energy hedging activities to manage pricing decisions  minimize the risk of price volatility  and minimize price risk exposure in the energy markets 
proliance s market exposure arises from storage inventory  imbalances  and fixed price forward purchase and sale contracts  which are entered into to support its operating activities 
currently  proliance buys and sells physical commodities and utilizes financial instruments to hedge its market exposure 
however  net open positions in terms of price  volume and specified delivery point do occur 
proliance manages open positions with policies which limit its exposure to market risk and require reporting potential financial exposure to its management and its members 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its borrowing arrangements 
its risk management program seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that market volatility may have on interest expense 
the company manages this risk by allowing and of its total debt to be exposed to short term interest rate volatility 
however  there are times when this targeted range of interest rate exposure may not be attained 
to manage this exposure  the company may use derivative financial instruments 
at december   such debt obligations  as affected by designated interest rate swaps and seasonal increases in short term debt outstanding  represented of the company s total debt portfolio 
market risk is estimated as the potential impact resulting from fluctuations in interest rates on adjustable rate borrowing arrangements exposed to short term interest rate volatility 
during and  the weighted average combined borrowings under these arrangements were million and million  respectively 
at december   and  combined borrowings under these arrangements were million and million  respectively 
based upon average borrowing rates under these facilities during the years ended december  and  an increase of basis points one percentage point in the rates would have increased interest expense by million and million  respectively 
other risks by using forward purchase contracts and derivative financial instruments to manage risk  the company exposes itself to counter party credit risk and market risk 
the company manages exposure to counter party credit risk by entering into contracts with companies that can be reasonably expected to fully perform under the terms of the contract 
counter party credit risk is monitored regularly and positions are adjusted appropriately to manage risk 
further  tools such as netting arrangements and requests for collateral are also used to manage credit risk 
market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in commodity prices or interest rates 
the company attempts to manage exposure to market risk associated with commodity contracts and interest rates by establishing parameters and monitoring those parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken 
the company s customer receivables from gas and electric sales and gas transportation services are primarily derived from a diversified base of residential  commercial  and industrial customers located in indiana and west central ohio 
the company manages credit risk associated with its receivables by continually reviewing creditworthiness and requests cash deposits or refunds cash deposits based on that review 
credit risk associated with certain investments is also managed by a review of creditworthiness and receipt of collateral 
although the company s regulated operations are exposed to limited commodity price risk  volatile natural gas prices can result in higher working capital requirements  increased expenses including unrecoverable interest costs  uncollectible accounts expense  and unaccounted for gas  and some level of price sensitive reduction in volumes sold 
the company mitigates these risks by executing derivative contracts that manage the price of forecasted natural gas purchases 
these contracts are subject to regulation  which allows for reasonable and prudent hedging costs to be recovered through rates 
when regulation is involved  sfas controls when the offset to mark to market accounting is recognized in earnings
