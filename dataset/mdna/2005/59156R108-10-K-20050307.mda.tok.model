economic capital beginning in  the company changed its methodology of allocating capital to its business segments from risk based capital rbc to economic capital 
prior to  the company s business segments allocated equity was primarily based on rbc  an internally developed formula based on applying a multiple to the national association of insurance commissioners naic statutory risk based capital and included certain adjustments in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
economic capital is an internally developed risk capital model  the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed 
the economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in metlife s businesses 
this is in contrast to the standardized regulatory rbc formula  which is not as refined in its risk calculations with respect to the nuances of the company s businesses 
the change in methodology is being applied prospectively 
this change has and will continue to impact the level of net investment income and net income of each of the company s business segments 
a portion of net investment income is credited to the segments based on the level of allocated equity 
this change in methodology of allocating equity does not impact the company s consolidated net investment income or net income 
the following table presents actual and pro forma net investment income with respect to the company s segments for the year ended december  the amounts shown as pro forma reflect net investment income that would have been reported in had the company allocated capital based on economic capital rather than on the basis of rbc 
net investment income for the year ended december  actual pro forma dollars in millions institutional   individual   auto home international reinsurance corporate other total   acquisitions and dispositions on january   the holding company completed the sale of ssrm holdings  inc ssrm to a third party for million of cash and stock 
as a result of the sale of ssrm  the company recognized income from discontinued operations of approximately million  net of income taxes  comprised of a realized gain of million  net of income taxes  and an operating expense related to a lease abandonment of million  net of income taxes 
under the terms of the agreement  metlife will have an opportunity to receive  prior to the end of  additional payments aggregating up to approximately of the base purchase price  based on  among other things  certain revenue retention and growth measures 
the purchase price is also subject to reduction over five years  depending on retention of certain metlife related business 
the company has reclassified the assets  liabilities and operations of ssrm into discontinued operations for all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  the sale of ssrm resulted in the elimination of the company s asset management segment 
the remaining asset management business  which is insignificant  has been reclassified into corporate other 
the company s discontinued operations for the year ended december  also includes expenses of approximately million  net of income taxes  related to the sale of ssrm 
in  a subsidiary of the company  reinsurance group of america  incorporated rga  entered into a coinsurance agreement under which it assumed the traditional us life reinsurance business of allianz life insurance company of north america allianz life 
the transaction added approximately billion of life reinsurance in force  million of premium and million of income before income tax expense  excluding minority interest expense  in the effects of such transaction are included within the reinsurance segment 
in  the company acquired aseguradora hidalgo sa hidalgo  an insurance company based in mexico with approximately billion in assets as of the date of acquisition june  
during the second quarter of  as a part of its acquisition and integration strategy  the international segment completed the legal merger of hidalgo into its original mexican subsidiary  seguro genesis  sa  forming metlife mexico  sa as a result of the merger of these companies  the company recorded million of earnings  net of income taxes  from the merger and a reduction in policyholder liabilities resulting from a change in reserve methodology 
such benefit was recorded in the second quarter of in the international segment 
see subsequent events below 
summary of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the most critical estimates include those used in determining i investment impairments  ii the fair value of investments in the absence of quoted market values  iii application of the consolidation rules to certain investments  iv the fair value of and accounting for derivatives  v the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs dac  including value of business acquired voba  vi the liability for future policyholder benefits  vii the liability for litigation and regulatory matters  and viii accounting for reinsurance transactions and employee benefit plans 
in applying these policies  management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
many of these policies  estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries  others are specific to the company s businesses and operations 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
investments the company s principal investments are in fixed maturities  mortgage and other loans and real estate  all of which are exposed to three primary sources of investment risk credit  interest rate and market valuation 
the financial statement risks are those associated with the recognition of impairments and income  as well as the determination of fair values 
the assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on management s case by case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value 
management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
inherent in management s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations used by the company in the impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to i the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below cost or amortized cost  ii the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  iii the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub sector  iv the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations  v the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer  series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources  vi the company s ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of its value to an amount equal to or greater than cost or amortized cost  vii unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows on asset backed securities  and viii other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies 
in addition  the earnings on certain investments are dependent upon market conditions  which could result in prepayments and changes in amounts to be earned due to changing interest rates or equity markets 
the determination of fair values in the absence of quoted market values is based on i valuation methodologies  ii securities the company deems to be comparable  and iii assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances 
the use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
in addition  the company enters into certain structured investment transactions  real estate joint ventures and limited partnerships for which the company may be deemed to be the primary beneficiary and  therefore  may be required to consolidate such investments 
the accounting rules for the determination of the primary beneficiary are complex and require evaluation of the contractual rights and obligations associated with each party involved in the entity  an estimate of the entity s expected losses and expected residual returns and the allocation of such estimates to each party 
derivatives the company enters into freestanding derivative transactions primarily to manage the risk associated with variability in cash flows or changes in fair values related to the company s financial assets and liabilities 
the company also uses derivative instruments to hedge its currency exposure associated with net investments in certain foreign operations 
the company also purchases investment securities  issues certain insurance policies and engages in certain reinsurance contracts that have embedded derivatives 
the associated financial statement risk is the volatility in net income which can result from i changes in fair value of derivatives not qualifying as accounting hedges  ii ineffectiveness of designated hedges  and iii counterparty default 
in addition  there is a risk that embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation are not identified and reported at fair value in the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for derivatives is complex  as evidenced by significant authoritative interpretations of the primary accounting standards which continue to evolve  as well as the significant judgments and estimates involved in determining fair value in the absence of quoted market values 
these estimates are based on valuation methodologies and assumptions deemed appropriate in the circumstances 
such assumptions include estimated volatility and interest rates used in the determination of fair value where quoted market values are not available 
the use of different assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
deferred policy acquisition costs the company incurs significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business 
these costs  which vary with and are primarily related to the production of that business  are deferred 
the recovery of such costs is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business 
the amount of future profit is dependent principally on investment returns in excess of the amounts credited to policyholders  mortality  morbidity  persistency  interest crediting rates  expenses to administer the business  creditworthiness of reinsurance counterparties and certain economic variables  such as inflation 
of these factors  the company anticipates that investment returns are most likely to impact the rate of amortization of such costs 
the aforementioned factors enter into management s estimates of gross margins and profits  which generally are used to amortize such costs 
revisions to estimates result in changes to the amounts expensed in the reporting period in which the revisions are made and could result in the impairment of the asset and a charge to income if estimated future gross margins and profits are less than amounts deferred 
in addition  the company utilizes the reversion to the mean assumption  a common industry practice  in its determination of the amortization of dac  including voba 
this practice assumes that the expectation for long term appreciation in equity markets is not changed by minor short term market fluctuations  but that it does change when large interim deviations have occurred 
liability for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses the company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under insurance policies  including traditional life insurance  traditional annuities and non medical health insurance 
generally  amounts are payable over an extended period of time and liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with gaap and applicable actuarial standards 
principal assumptions used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are mortality  morbidity  expenses  persistency  investment returns and inflation 
the company also establishes liabilities for unpaid claims and claim expenses for property and casualty claim insurance which represent the amount estimated for claims that have been reported but not settled and claims incurred but not reported 
liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon the company s historical experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the effects of current developments  anticipated trends and risk management programs  reduced for anticipated salvage and subrogation 
differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in pricing these policies and in the establishment of liabilities result in variances in profit and could result in losses 
the effects of changes in such estimated reserves are included in the results of operations in the period in which the changes occur 
reinsurance the company enters into reinsurance transactions as both a provider and a purchaser of reinsurance 
accounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions and estimates  particularly related to the future performance of the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty credit risks 
the company periodically reviews actual and anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned assumptions used to establish assets and liabilities relating to ceded and assumed reinsurance and evaluates the financial strength of counterparties to its reinsurance agreements using criteria similar to that evaluated in the security impairment process discussed previously 
additionally  for each of its reinsurance contracts  the company must determine if the contract provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk  in accordance with applicable accounting standards 
the company must review all contractual features  particularly those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims 
if the company determines that a reinsurance contract does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk  the company records the contract using the deposit method of accounting 
litigation the company is a party to a number of legal actions and regulatory investigations 
given the inherent unpredictability of these matters  it is difficult to estimate the impact on the company s consolidated financial position 
liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
liabilities related to certain lawsuits  including the company s asbestos related liability  are especially difficult to estimate due to the limitation of available data and uncertainty regarding numerous variables used to determine amounts recorded 
the data and variables that impact the assumptions used to estimate the company s asbestos related liability include the number of future claims  the cost to resolve claims  the disease mix and severity of disease  the jurisdiction of claims filed  tort reform efforts and the impact of any possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts 
on a quarterly and annual basis the company reviews relevant information with respect to liabilities for litigation  regulatory investigations and litigation related contingencies to be reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the review includes senior legal and financial personnel 
it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain of the company s litigation and regulatory investigations  including asbestos related cases  or the use of different assumptions in the determination of amounts recorded could have a material effect upon the company s consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods 
employee benefit plans the company sponsors pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering employees who meet specified eligibility requirements 
the reported expense and liability associated with these plans requires an extensive use of assumptions which include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company 
management determines these assumptions based upon currently available market and industry data  historical performance of the plan and its assets  and consultation with an independent consulting actuarial firm 
these assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants 
these differences may have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements and liquidity 
results of operations executive summary metlife  inc  through its subsidiaries and affiliates  is a leading provider of insurance and other financial services to individual and institutional customers 
the company offers life insurance  annuities  automobile and homeowner s insurance and retail banking services to individuals  as well as group insurance  reinsurance  and retirement savings products and services to corporations and other institutions

outside the united states  the metlife companies serve approximately million customers through direct insurance operations in argentina  brazil  chile  china  hong kong  india  indonesia  mexico  south korea  taiwan and uruguay 
metlife is organized into five operating segments institutional  individual  auto home  international and reinsurance  as well as corporate other 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the company reported  million in net income and diluted earnings per share of for the year ended december  compared to  million in net income and diluted earnings per share of for the year ended december  continued top line revenue growth across all of the company s business segments  strong interest rate spreads and an improvement in net investment gains losses are the leading contributors to the increase in net income for the year ended december  over the comparable period 
total premiums  fees and other revenues increased to billion  up  from the year ended december   primarily from continued sales growth across most of the company s business segments  as well as the positive impact of the us financial markets on policy fees 
policy fees from variable life and annuity and investment type products are typically calculated as a percentage of the average assets in policyholder accounts 
the value of these assets can fluctuate depending on equity performance 
continued strong investment spreads are largely due to higher than expected net investment income from corporate joint venture income and bond and commercial mortgage prepayment fees 
in addition  an improvement in net investment gains losses  net of income taxes  of million is primarily due to the more favorable economic environment in these increases are partially offset by an million  net of income taxes  cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in recorded in accordance with statement of position  accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain nontraditional long duration contracts and for separate accounts sop 
in comparison  in the period the company recorded a million charge for a cumulative effect of a change in accounting in accordance with fasb statement implementation issue b issue b 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the marketplace for financial services is extremely competitive 
metlife reported  million in net income and diluted earnings per share of for the year ended december  in  after a three year economic slowdown  there were improvements in both the credit and equity markets 
at the same time  interest rates remained at historic lows and the s p index was up for the year 
total premiums and fees increased to billion  up over the prior year  which primarily stems from continued sales growth across most of the company s segments  as well as the positive impact of the us financial markets on policy fees 
assets under management grew to billion  up over the prior year  and individual annuity deposits grew to billion  up over the prior year 
metlife generated over billion of net investment income while adhering to rigorous asset liability management principles and portfolio diversification 
an increase in expenses year over year is primarily attributable to employee related expenses  including pension and postretirement benefit expense and severance  expenses associated with strengthening the company s distribution systems and taking action in consolidating office space and reducing redundancies  while continuing to invest heavily in infrastructure 
in addition  regulatory capital increased and the company repurchased stock through its buyback program 
industry trends the company s segments continue to be influenced by a variety of industry trends and the company believes that each of its businesses is well positioned to capitalize on those trends 
in general  the company sees more employers  both large and small  outsourcing their benefits functions 
further  companies are offering broader arrays of voluntary benefits to help retain employees while adding little to their overall benefits costs 
the company believes that these trends will likely continue and in fact expand across companies of all sizes 
employers are also demanding substantial online access for their employees for various self service functions 
this functionality requires substantial information technology investment that smaller companies will find difficult to absorb 
this will put pressure on those smaller and mid size companies to gain scale quickly or exit the business 
additionally  the company is seeing a continuing trend of employers moving to defined contribution plans over defined benefit plans 
in addition  alternative benefit structures  such as simple fixed benefit products  are becoming more popular as the cost of traditional medical indemnity products has continued to increase rapidly 
these low cost fixed benefit products can provide effective catastrophic protection for high cost illnesses to supplement the basic health coverage provided by medical indemnity insurance 
from a demographics standpoint  the bulk of the united states population is moving from an asset accumulation phase to an asset distribution phase 
people within ten years of retirement hold significant assets 
with continually lengthening lifespans and unstructured asset distribution  the company believes many of these people may outlive their retirement savings and or require long term care 
as a result  the company expects that the demand for retirement payout solutions with guarantees will increase dramatically over the next decade 
in each of these demographic scenarios  the quality of the guarantee will be a key driver of growth 
the company believes that these guarantees will be evaluated through balance sheet strength  the claims paying ability and financial strength ratings of the guarantor  as well as the reputation of the company 
the company believes that in each of these comparisons  it will be at a distinct advantage versus the industry on average 
the company expects that these trends will continue to favor those with scale  breadth of distribution and product  ability to provide advice and financial strength to support long term guarantees 
discussion of results year ended december  dollars in millions revenues premiums    universal life and investment type product policy fees    net investment income    other revenues    net investment gains losses total revenues    expenses policyholder benefits and claims    interest credited to policyholder account balances    policyholder dividends    other expenses    total expenses    income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes    provision for income taxes  income from continuing operations    income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes income before cumulative effect of a change in accounting    cumulative effect of a change in accounting  net of income taxes net income    year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the company income from continuing operations increased by million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million in the comparable period 
income from continuing operations for the years ended december  and includes the impact of certain transactions or events  the timing  nature and amount of which are generally unpredictable 
these transactions are described in each applicable segment s discussion below 
these items contributed a benefit of million  net of income taxes  to the year ended december  and a benefit of million  net of income taxes  to the comparable period 
excluding the impact of these items  income from continuing operations increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the prior period 
this increase is primarily the result of an improvement in net investment gains losses  net of income taxes  of million 
also contributing to the increase is higher earnings from interest rate spreads of approximately million  net of income taxes  in the institutional and individual segments 
additionally  the individual segment contributed million  net of income taxes  as a result of increased income from policy fees on investment type products partially offset by higher amortization associated with dac of million  net of income taxes  and a reduction in earnings of million  net of income taxes  resulting from an increase in the closed block policyholder dividend obligation 
in addition  the auto home segment s earnings increased primarily due to an improved non catastrophe combined ratio and favorable claim development related to prior accident years of million  net of income taxes 
this increase was partially offset by higher catastrophe losses of million  net of income taxes 
premiums  fees and other revenues increased by  million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million from the comparable period 
the institutional segment contributed to the year over year increase 
this increase stems largely from sales growth and the acquisitions of new businesses in the group life and the non medical health other businesses  as well as an increase in structured settlements sales and pension close outs 
the reinsurance segment contributed approximately to the company s year over year increase in premium  fees and other revenues 
this growth is primarily attributable to this segment s coinsurance agreement with allianz life and continued growth in its traditional life reinsurance operations 
the individual segment contributed to the year over year increase primarily due to higher fee income  partially offset by a reduction in the company s closed block premiums as the business continues to run off 
interest rate spreads  which generally represent the margin between net investment income and interest credited to policyholder account balances  increased across the institutional and individual segments during the year ended december  compared to the prior year period 
earnings from interest rate spreads are influenced by several factors  including business growth  movement in interest rates  and certain investment and investment related transactions  such as corporate joint venture income and bond and commercial mortgage prepayment fees for which the timing and amount are generally unpredictable  and  as a result  can fluctuate from period to period 
if interest rates remain low  it could result in compression of the company s interest rate spreads on several of its products  which provide guaranteed minimum rates of return to policyholders 
this compression could adversely impact the company s future financial results 
underwriting results in the institutional and individual segments in the year ended december  were less favorable compared to the period 
underwriting results are significantly influenced by mortality and morbidity trends  claim experience and the reinsurance activity related to certain blocks of business  and  as a result  can fluctuate from period to period 
underwriting results in the auto home segment were favorable in as the combined ratio declined to  excluding catastrophes  from in the prior year period 
this result is largely due to continued improvement in both auto and homeowner claim frequencies  lower auto severities and an increase in average earned premiums 
other expenses increased by million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the comparable period 
the period reflects a million reduction of a premium tax liability and a million reduction of a liability for interest associated with the resolution of all issues relating to the internal revenue service s audit of metropolitan life s and its subsidiaries tax returns for the years these decreases were partially offset by a million contribution of appreciated stock to the metlife foundation 
the period includes the impact of a million reduction of a previously established liability related to the company s race conscious underwriting settlement 
in addition  the period includes a million charge related to certain improperly deferred expenses at new england financial and a million charge related to voba associated with a change in reserve methodology in the company s international segment 
excluding the impact of these transactions  other expenses increased by million  or  from the comparable period 
the reinsurance segment contributed to this year over year variance primarily due to the growth in expenses with allianz life and continued revenue growth  as mentioned above 
in addition  of this variance is primarily attributable to increases in direct business support expenses and non deferrable commission expenses associated with general business growth  as well as infrastructure improvements  partially offset by costs in associated with office consolidations and an impairment of assets in the institutional segment 
the individual segment contributed to this increase primarily due to accelerated dac amortization  as well as an increase in expenses associated with general business growth 
the remainder of the increase is the result of general business growth across the remaining segments and corporate other 
net investment gains losses increased by million  or  to a net investment gain of million for the year ended december  from a net investment loss of million for the comparable period 
this increase is primarily due to the more favorable economic environment in income tax expense for the year ended december  was  million  or of income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes  compared with million  or  for the comparable period 
the effective tax rate differs from the corporate tax rate of primarily due to the impact of non taxable investment income  tax credits for investments in low income housing  a decrease in the deferred tax valuation allowance to recognize the effect of certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards in south korea  and the contribution of appreciated stock to the metlife foundation 
in addition  the effective tax rate reflects an adjustment of million for the resolution of all issues relating to the internal revenue service s audit of metropolitan life s and its subsidiaries tax returns for the years also  the effective tax rate reflects an adjustment of million consisting primarily of a revision in the estimate of income taxes for the effective tax rate differs from the corporate tax rate of primarily due to the impact of non taxable investment income  tax credits for investments in low income housing  and tax benefits related to the sale of foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  the effective tax rate reflects an adjustment of million consisting primarily of a revision in the estimate of income taxes for the income from discontinued operations is comprised of the operations of ssrm and net investment income and net investment gains related to real estate properties that the company has classified as available for sale 
the company entered into an agreement to sell ssrm during the third quarter of as previously discussed  ssrm was sold effective january  income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period 
the decrease is primarily due to lower recognized net investment gains from real estate properties sold in as compared to the prior year 
for the years ended december  and  the company recognized million and million of net investment gains  respectively  from discontinued operations related to real estate properties sold or held for sale 
during the year ended december   the company recorded an million charge  net of income taxes  for a cumulative effect of a change in accounting in accordance with sop  which provides guidance on i the classification and valuation of long duration contract liabilities  ii the accounting for sales inducements  and iii separate account presentation and valuation 
this charge is primarily related to those long duration contract liabilities where the amount of the liability is indexed to the performance of a target portfolio of investment securities 
during the year ended december   the company recorded a million charge  net of income taxes  for a cumulative effect of a change in accounting in accordance with issue b year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the company income from continuing operations increased by million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million in the comparable period 
income from continuing operations for the years and includes the impact of certain transactions or events that result in net income not being indicative of future earnings  which are described in the applicable segment s results of operations discussions 
these items contributed a benefit of million  net of income taxes  in and a charge of million  net of income taxes  in excluding the impact of these items  income from continuing operations increased by million in compared to the prior year 
declines in net investment losses account for million  net of income taxes  of this increase with the balance being contributed by the company s operations 
the decline in net investment losses is largely attributable to less credit related losses  which is consistent with the us financial market environment 
premiums  fees and other revenues increased over the prior year primarily as a result of growth in the annuities  retirement savings and variable and universal life product lines 
this increase stems in part from policy fee income earned on annuity deposits  which were billion in  increasing from the prior year 
in addition  the annuity separate account balance was billion at december   up versus the prior year end 
growth in retirement savings is primarily attributable to higher sales in structured settlement products 
fee income from variable and universal life products increased over the prior year primarily as a result of a growth in separate account balances 
in addition  the coinsurance agreement with allianz life in the reinsurance segment contributed approximately to the year over year increase 
partially offsetting these increases is a decline in traditional life premiums  which is largely attributable to run off in the company s closed block of business 
investment margins  which represent the spread between net investment income and interest credited to policyholder account balances  remained favorable in as the company took appropriate crediting rate reductions in most products in an effort to keep pace with the market environment 
in several product lines  where investment margins are a substantial part of earnings  the company still has a reasonable amount of flexibility to reduce crediting rates further if portfolio yields were to decline from year end levels 
investment margins in did benefit from higher than expected levels of prepayments 
underwriting results varied in the group life mortality ratio continues to be favorable at 
the individual life mortality ratio was also solid at  which includes the impact of several large claims in the variable and universal product line  some of which had lower levels of reinsurance 
group disability s morbidity ratio increased to  from in the prior year but is still within management s expected range 
the auto home combined ratio  which is a measure of both the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio  as well as the expense ratio  remained favorable at excluding catastrophes 
the company s international segment increased its loss recognition reserve in taiwan as a result of low interest rates relative to product guarantees 
this action resulted in a million charge  net of income taxes 
other expenses increased over the prior year period primarily as a result of an increase of million in pension and postretirement expenses 
as a result of contributions made to the pension plan in late and early  which totaled approximately million  and the stronger performance of the pension plan assets in  the company anticipates the pension and postretirement expenses to moderate in other expenses in also include the impact of several actions taken by management in the fourth quarter  including lease terminations  office consolidations and closures  and asset impairments 
in addition  severance costs and expenses associated with strategic initiatives at new england financial contributed to the increase in expenses year over year 
also  there was an increase in many of the product lines volume related expenses  which are in line with business growth 
net investment losses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period 
this improvement is primarily due to lower credit related losses 
income tax expense for the year ended december  was million  or of income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting  compared with million  or  for the comparable period 
the effective tax rate differs from the corporate tax rate of primarily due to the impact of non taxable investment income  tax credits for investments in low income housing  a recovery of prior year tax overpayments on tax exempt bonds  and an adjustment consisting primarily of a revision in the estimate of income taxes for in addition  the effective tax rate includes a reduction of the deferred tax valuation allowance related to certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards  and tax benefits related to the sale and merger of foreign subsidiaries reflected in the international segment 
the effective tax rate differs from the corporate tax rate of primarily due to the impact of non taxable investment income  partially offset by the inability to utilize tax benefits on certain foreign capital losses 
the income from discontinued operations is comprised of the operations of ssrm and net investment income and net investment gains related to real estate properties that the company has classified as available for sale 
the company sold ssrm on january  income from discontinued operations declined million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million in the comparable prior year period 
the decrease is primarily due to lower recognized net investment gains from real estate properties sold in as compared to the prior year 
for the years ended december  and  the company recognized million and million of net investment gains  respectively  from discontinued operations related to real estate properties sold or held for sale 
the company changed its method of accounting for embedded derivatives in certain insurance products as required by new accounting guidance which became effective on october   and recorded the impact as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle

the amount shown in the more than five years column represents the sum of cash flows  also adjusted for the estimated timing of mortality  retirement and other appropriate factors and undiscounted with respect to interest  extending for more than years from the present date 
as a result  the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of billion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of billion included in the consolidated financial statements at december  the liability amount in the consolidated financial statements reflects the discounting for interest  as well as adjustments for the timing of other factors as described above 
amounts differ from the balances presented on the consolidated balance sheets 
the amounts above do not include related premiums and discounts or capital leases which are presented separately 
the company anticipates that these amounts could be invested in these partnerships any time over the next five years  but are presented in the current period  as the timing of the fulfillment of the obligation cannot be predicted

although in light of these considerations  it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a material adverse effect upon the company s consolidated financial position  based on information currently known by the company s management  in its opinion  the outcomes of such pending investigations and legal proceedings are not likely to have such an effect 
however  given the large and or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation  it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could  from time to time  have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods 
other 
based on management s analysis of its expected cash inflows from operating activities  the dividends it receives from subsidiaries  including metropolitan life  that are permitted to be paid without prior insurance regulatory approval and its portfolio of liquid assets and other anticipated cash flows  management believes there will be sufficient liquidity to enable the company to make payments on debt  make cash dividend payments on its common stock  pay all operating expenses  and meet its cash needs 
the nature of the company s diverse product portfolio and customer base lessens the likelihood that normal operations will result in any significant strain on liquidity

fixed maturity and equity security impairment 
the company classifies all of its fixed maturities and equity securities as available for sale and marks them to market through other comprehensive income  except for non marketable private equities  which are generally carried at cost 
all securities with gross unrealized losses at the consolidated balance sheet date are subjected to the company s process for identifying other than temporary impairments 
the company writes down to fair value securities that it deems to be other than temporarily impaired in the period the securities are deemed to be so impaired 
the assessment of whether such impairment has occurred is based on management s case by case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value 
management considers a wide range of factors  as described in summary of critical accounting estimates investments  about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
inherent in management s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
the company s review of its fixed maturities and equity securities for impairments includes an analysis of the total gross unrealized losses by three categories of securities i securities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or amortized cost by less than  ii securities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or amortized cost by or more for less than six months  and iii securities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or amortized cost by or more for six months or greater 
while all of these securities are monitored for potential impairment  the company s experience indicates that the first two categories do not present as great a risk of impairment  and often  fair values recover over time as the factors that caused the declines improve 
the company records impairments as investment losses and adjusts the cost basis of the fixed maturities and equity securities accordingly 
the company does not change the revised cost basis for subsequent recoveries in value 
impairments of fixed maturities and equity securities were million  million and  million for the years ended december   and  respectively

in addition  the company provides collateral management services for certain of these structures for which it collects a management fee 
the maximum exposure to loss relating to real estate joint ventures  other limited partnerships and other structured investments is equal to the carrying amounts plus any unfunded commitments  reduced by amounts guaranteed by other partners 
real estate joint ventures include partnerships and other ventures  which engage in the acquisition  development  management and disposal of real estate investments 
other limited partnerships include partnerships established for the purpose of investing in real estate funds  public and private debt and equity securities  as well as limited partnerships established for the purpose of investing in low income housing that qualifies for federal tax credits 
other structured investments include an offering of a collateralized fund of funds based on the securitization of a pool of private equity funds 
securities lending the company participates in a securities lending program whereby blocks of securities  which are included in investments  are loaned to third parties  primarily major brokerage firms 
the company requires a minimum of of the fair value of the loaned securities to be separately maintained as collateral for the loans 
securities with a cost or amortized cost of  million and  million and an estimated fair value of  million and  million were on loan under the program at december  and  respectively 
the company was liable for cash collateral under its control of  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
security collateral on deposit from customers may not be sold or repledged and is not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
separate accounts the company had billion and billion held in its separate accounts  for which the company generally does not bear investment risk  as of december  and  respectively 
the company manages each separate account s assets in accordance with the prescribed investment policy that applies to that specific separate account 
the company establishes separate accounts on a single client and multi client commingled basis in compliance with insurance laws 
effective with the adoption of sop  on january   the company reports separately  as assets and liabilities  investments held in separate accounts and liabilities of the separate accounts if i such separate accounts are legally recognized  ii assets supporting the contract liabilities are legally insulated from the company s general account liabilities  iii investments are directed by the contractholder  and iv all investment performance  net of contract fees and assessments  is passed through to the contractholder 
the company reports separate account assets meeting such criteria at their fair value 
investment performance including investment income  net investment gains losses and changes in unrealized gains losses and the corresponding amounts credited to contractholders of such separate accounts are offset within the same line in the consolidated statements of income 
in connection with the adoption of sop  separate account assets with a fair value of billion were reclassified to general account investments with a corresponding transfer of separate account liabilities to future policy benefits and policyholder account balances 
see application of recent accounting pronouncements 
the company s revenues reflect fees charged to the separate accounts  including mortality charges  risk charges  policy administration fees  investment management fees and surrender charges 
separate accounts not meeting the above criteria are combined on a line by line basis with the company s general account assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
off balance sheet arrangements commitments to fund partnership investments the company makes commitments to fund partnership investments in the normal course of business 
the amounts of these unfunded commitments were approximately  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
the company anticipates that these amounts will be invested in the partnerships over the next three to five years 
mortgage loan commitments the company commits to lend funds under mortgage loan commitments 
the amounts of these mortgage loan commitments were  million and million  respectively  at december  and guarantees in the course of its business  the company has provided certain indemnities  guarantees and commitments to third parties pursuant to which it may be required to make payments now or in the future 
in the context of acquisition  disposition  investment and other transactions  the company has provided indemnities and guarantees  including those related to tax  environmental and other specific liabilities  and other indemnities and guarantees that are triggered by  among other things  breaches of representations  warranties or covenants provided by the company 
in addition  in the normal course of business  the company provides indemnifications to counterparties in contracts with triggers similar to the foregoing  as well as for certain other liabilities  such as third party lawsuits 
these obligations are often subject to time limitations that vary in duration  including contractual limitations and those that arise by operation of law  such as applicable statutes of limitation 
in some cases  the maximum potential obligation under the indemnities and guarantees is subject to a contractual limitation ranging from less than million to million  while in other cases such limitations are not specified or applicable 
since certain of these obligations are not subject to limitations  the company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount due under these guarantees in the future 
in addition  the company indemnifies its directors and officers as provided in its charters and by laws 
also  the company indemnifies other of its agents for liabilities incurred as a result of their representation of the company s interests 
since these indemnities are generally not subject to limitation with respect to duration or amount  the company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount due under these indemnities in the future 
during the year ended december   the company recorded liabilities of million with respect to indemnities provided in certain dispositions 
the approximate term for these liabilities ranges from to months 
the maximum potential amount of future payments that metlife could be required to pay is million 
due to the uncertainty in assessing changes to the liabilities over the term  the liability on the balance sheet will remain until either expiration or settlement of the guarantee unless evidence clearly indicates that the estimates should be revised 
the fair value of the remaining indemnities  guarantees and commitments entered into during was insignificant and thus  no liabilities were recorded 
the company s recorded liability at december  and for indemnities  guarantees and commitments  excluding amounts recorded during as described in the preceding sentences  is insignificant 
accelerated share repurchase on december   the holding company repurchased  shares of its outstanding common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately million under an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a major bank 
the bank borrowed the stock sold to the holding company from third parties and is purchasing the shares in the open market over the next few months to return to the lenders 
the holding company will either pay or receive an amount based on the actual amount paid by the bank to purchase the shares 
the final purchase price is expected to be determined in april  and will be settled in either cash or holding company stock at the holding company s option 
the holding company recorded the initial repurchase of shares as treasury stock and will record any amount paid or received as an adjustment to the cost of the treasury stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company must effectively manage  measure and monitor the market risk associated with its invested assets and interest rate sensitive insurance contracts 
it has developed an integrated process for managing risk  which it conducts through its corporate risk management department  asset liability management committees a lm committees and additional specialists at the business segment level 
the company has established and implemented comprehensive policies and procedures at both the corporate and business segment level to minimize the effects of potential market volatility 
market risk exposures the company has exposure to market risk through its insurance operations and investment activities 
for purposes of this disclosure  market risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rates 
the company s exposure to interest rate changes results from its significant holdings of fixed maturities  as well as its interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the fixed maturities include us and foreign government bonds  securities issued by government agencies  corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities  all of which are mainly exposed to changes in medium and long term treasury rates 
the interest rate sensitive liabilities for purposes of this disclosure include guaranteed interest contracts and fixed annuities  which have the same type of interest rate exposure medium and long term treasury rates as the fixed maturities 
the company employs product design  pricing and asset liability management strategies to reduce the adverse effects of interest rate volatility 
product design and pricing strategies include the use of surrender charges or restrictions on withdrawals in some products 
asset liability management strategies include the use of derivatives  the purchase of securities structured to protect against prepayments  prepayment restrictions and related fees on mortgage loans and consistent monitoring of the pricing of the company s products in order to better match the duration of the assets and the liabilities they support 
equity prices 
the company s investments in equity securities expose it to changes in equity prices  as do certain liabilities which involve long term guarantees on equity performance 
it manages this risk on an integrated basis with other risks through its asset liability management strategies 
the company also manages equity price risk through industry and issuer diversification  asset allocation techniques and the use of derivatives 
foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar results from its holdings in non us dollar denominated fixed maturity securities  equity securities and liabilities  as well as through its investments in foreign subsidiaries 
the principal currencies which create foreign currency exchange rate risk in the company s investment portfolios are the euro  canadian dollars and british pounds 
the company mitigates the majority of its fixed maturities foreign currency exchange rate risk through the utilization of foreign currency swaps and forward contracts 
through its investments in foreign subsidiaries  the company is primarily exposed to the mexican peso  south korean won  chilean peso and taiwanese dollar 
the company has matched substantially all of its foreign currency liabilities in its foreign subsidiaries with their respective foreign currency assets  thereby reducing its risk to currency exchange rate fluctuation 
in some countries  local surplus is held entirely or in part in us dollar assets which further minimizes exposure to exchange rate fluctuation risk 
selectively  the company uses us dollar assets to support certain long duration foreign currency liabilities 
risk management corporate risk management 
metlife has established several financial and non financial senior management committees as part of its risk management process 
these committees manage capital and risk positions  approve asset liability management strategies and establish appropriate corporate business standards 
metlife also has a separate corporate risk management department  which is responsible for risk throughout metlife and reports to metlife s chief financial officer 
the corporate risk management department s primary responsibilities consist of implementing a board of directors approved corporate risk framework  which outlines the company s approach for managing risk on an enterprise wide basis  developing policies and procedures for managing  measuring and monitoring those risks identified in the corporate risk framework  establishing appropriate corporate risk tolerance levels  deploying capital on an economic capital basis  and reporting on a periodic basis to the governance committee of the holding company s board of directors and various financial and non financial senior management committees 
asset liability management 
the company actively manages its assets using an approach that balances quality  diversification  asset liability matching  liquidity and investment return 
the goals of the investment process are to optimize  net of income taxes  risk adjusted investment income and risk adjusted total return while ensuring that the assets and liabilities are managed on a cash flow and duration basis 
the asset liability management process is the shared responsibility of the portfolio management unit  the business finance asset liability management unit  and the operating business segments under the supervision of the various product line specific a lm committees 
the a lm committees duties include reviewing and approving target portfolios on a periodic basis  establishing investment guidelines and limits and providing oversight of the asset liability management process 
the portfolio managers and asset sector specialists  who have responsibility on a day to day basis for risk management of their respective investing activities  implement the goals and objectives established by the a lm committees 
each of metlife s business segments has an asset liability officer who works with portfolio managers in the investment department to monitor investment  product pricing  hedge strategy and liability management issues 
metlife establishes target asset portfolios for each major insurance product  which represent the investment strategies used to profitably fund its liabilities within acceptable levels of risk 
these strategies include objectives for effective duration  yield curve sensitivity  convexity  liquidity  asset sector concentration and credit quality 
to manage interest rate risk  the company performs periodic projections of asset and liability cash flows to evaluate the potential sensitivity of its securities investments and liabilities to interest rate movements 
these projections involve evaluating the potential gain or loss on most of the company s in force business under various increasing and decreasing interest rate environments 
new york state department of insurance regulations require that metlife perform some of these analyses annually as part of metlife s review of the sufficiency of its regulatory reserves 
for several of its legal entities  the company maintains segmented operating and surplus asset portfolios for the purpose of asset liability management and the allocation of investment income to product lines 
for each segment  invested assets greater than or equal to the gaap liabilities less the dac asset and any non invested assets allocated to the segment are maintained  with any excess swept to the surplus segment 
the operating segments may reflect differences in legal entity  statutory line of business and any product market characteristic which may drive a distinct investment strategy with respect to duration  liquidity or credit quality of the invested assets 
certain smaller entities make use of unsegmented general accounts for which the investment strategy reflects the aggregate characteristics of liabilities in those entities 
the company measures relative sensitivities of the value of its assets and liabilities to changes in key assumptions utilizing company models 
these models reflect specific product characteristics and include assumptions based on current and anticipated experience regarding lapse  mortality and interest crediting rates 
in addition  these models include asset cash flow projections reflecting interest payments  sinking fund payments  principal payments  bond calls  mortgage prepayments and defaults 
common industry metrics  such as duration and convexity  are also used to measure the relative sensitivity of assets and liability values to changes in interest rates 
in computing the duration of liabilities  consideration is given to all policyholder guarantees and to how the company intends to set indeterminate policy elements such as interest credits or dividends 
each operating asset segment has a duration constraint based on the liability duration and the investment objectives of that portfolio 
where a liability cash flow may exceed the maturity of available assets  as is the case with certain retirement and non medical health products  the company may support such liabilities with equity investments or curve mismatch strategies 
hedging activities 
metlife s risk management strategies incorporate the use of various interest rate derivatives to adjust the overall duration and cash flow profile of its invested asset portfolios to better match the duration and cash flow profile of its liabilities to reduce interest rate risk 
such instruments include financial futures  financial forwards  interest rate and credit default swaps  caps  floors and options 
metlife also uses foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forwards to hedge its foreign currency denominated fixed income investments 
in  metlife initiated a hedging strategy for certain equity price risks within its liabilities using equity futures and options 
economic capital 
beginning in  the company changed its methodology of allocating capital to its business segments from risk based capital rbc to economic capital 
prior to  the company s business segments allocated equity was primarily based on rbc  an internally developed formula based on applying a multiple to the naic statutory risk based capital and included certain adjustments in accordance with gaap 
economic capital is an internally developed risk capital model  the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed 
the economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in metlife s businesses 
this is in contrast to the standardized regulatory rbc formula  which is not as refined in its risk calculations with respect to the nuances of the company s businesses 
this change in methodology is being applied prospectively 
this change has and will continue to impact the level of net investment income and net income of each of the company s business segments 
a portion of net investment income is credited to the segments based on the level of allocated equity 
this change in methodology of allocating equity does not impact the company s consolidated net investment income or net income 
risk measurement  sensitivity analysis the company measures market risk related to its holdings of invested assets and other financial instruments  including certain market risk sensitive insurance contracts  based on changes in interest rates  equity prices and currency exchange rates  utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
this analysis estimates the potential changes in fair value  cash flows and earnings based on a hypothetical change increase or decrease in interest rates  equity prices and currency exchange rates 
the company believes that a change increase or decrease in these market rates and prices is reasonably possible in the near term 
in performing this analysis  the company used market rates at december  to re price its invested assets and other financial instruments 
the sensitivity analysis separately calculated each of metlife s market risk exposures interest rate  equity price and foreign currency exchange rate related to its non trading invested assets and other financial instruments 
the company does not maintain a trading portfolio 
the sensitivity analysis performed included the market risk sensitive holdings described above 
the company modeled the impact of changes in market rates and prices on the fair values of its invested assets  earnings and cash flows as follows fair values 
the company bases its potential change in fair values on an immediate change increase or decrease in the net present values of its interest rate sensitive exposures resulting from a change increase or decrease in interest rates  the us dollar equivalent balances of the company s currency exposures due to a change increase or decrease in currency exchange rates  and the market value of its equity positions due to a change increase or decrease in equity prices 
earnings and cash flows 
metlife calculates the potential change in earnings and cash flows on the change in its earnings and cash flows over a one year period based on an immediate change increase or decrease in market rates and equity prices 
the following factors were incorporated into the earnings and cash flows sensitivity analyses the reinvestment of fixed maturity securities  the reinvestment of payments and prepayments of principal related to mortgage backed securities  the re estimation of prepayment rates on mortgage backed securities for each change increase or decrease in the interest rates  and the expected turnover sales of fixed maturities and equity securities  including the reinvestment of the resulting proceeds 
the sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be viewed as predictive of the company s future financial performance 
the company cannot assure that its actual losses in any particular year will not exceed the amounts indicated in the table below 
limitations related to this sensitivity analysis include the market risk information is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related sensitivity analysis  including the impact of prepayment rates on mortgages  for derivatives which qualify as hedges  the impact on reported earnings may be materially different from the change in market values  the analysis excludes other significant real estate holdings and liabilities pursuant to insurance contracts  and the model assumes that the composition of assets and liabilities remains unchanged throughout the year 
accordingly  the company uses such models as tools and not substitutes for the experience and judgment of its corporate risk and asset liability management personnel 
based on its analysis of the impact of a change increase or decrease in market rates and prices  metlife has determined that such a change could have a material adverse effect on the fair value of its interest rate sensitive invested assets 
the equity and foreign currency portfolios do not expose the company to material market risk 
the table below illustrates the potential loss in fair value of the company s interest rate sensitive financial instruments at december  in addition  the potential loss with respect to the fair value of currency exchange rates and the company s equity price sensitive positions at december  is set forth in the table below 
the potential loss in fair value for each market risk exposure of the company s portfolio  all of which is non trading  as of the period indicated was december  dollars in millions interest rate risk  equity price risk foreign currency exchange rate risk the table below provides additional detail regarding the potential loss in fair value of the company s interest sensitive financial instruments at december  by type of asset or liability 
as of december  assuming a increase notional in the yield amount fair value curve dollars in millions assets fixed maturities   mortgage loans on real estate  equity securities  short term investments  cash and cash equivalents  policy loans  mortgage loan commitments  total assets  liabilities policyholder account balances  short term debt  long term debt  shares subject to mandatory redemption payable under securities loaned transactions  total liabilities other derivative instruments designated hedges or otherwise swaps  futures forwards  options  total other net change  in addition to the analysis discussed above  the company also performs an analysis of the sensitivity of its insurance and interest sensitive liabilities to changes in interest rates as a part of its asset liability management program 
as of december   a hypothetical instantaneous decrease in interest rates applied to the company s insurance and interest sensitive liabilities and their associated operating asset portfolios would reduce the fair value of equity by million 
management does not expect that this sensitivity would produce a liquidity strain on the company
