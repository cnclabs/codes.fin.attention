these statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors that may cause our actual results  performance  or achievement to differ materially from anticipated results  performance  or achievement  expressed or implied in such forward looking statements 
these statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and subject to risks and uncertainties 
we discuss many of these risks and uncertainties at the beginning of this annual report on form k and under the heading business and risk factors and certain factors affecting future operating results 
the following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of anika therapeutics  inc and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
management overview anika therapeutics develops  manufactures and commercializes therapeutic products and devices intended to promote the protection and healing of bone  cartilage and soft tissue 
these products are based on hyaluronic acid ha  a naturally occurring  biocompatible polymer found throughout the body 
due to its unique biophysical and biochemical properties  ha plays an important role in a number of physiological functions such as the protection and lubrication of soft tissues and joints  the maintenance of the structural integrity of tissues  and the transport of molecules to and within cells 
our marketed products include therapies for the treatment of joint diseases such as osteoarthritis and viscoelastic products used in eye surgery 
products in development include chemically modified  cross linked forms of ha to prevent surgical adhesions and for cosmetic tissue augmentation cta 
our currently marketed products include orthovisc  an ha product used in the treatment of some forms of osteoarthritis in humans  and hyvisc  an ha product used in the treatment of equine osteoarthritis 
in the us  orthovisc became available for sale on march  and is marketed by ortho biotech products  lp  under an exclusive license and supply agreement 
internationally  orthovisc has been approved for sale and marketed since under various distribution and marketing agreements 
hyvisc is marketed in the us through an exclusive agreement with boehringer ingelheim vetmedica  inc our ophthalmic products include coease  staarvisc ii  and shellgel  each an injectable ophthalmic viscoelastic ha product  distributed by advanced medical optics  inc  staar surgical company  and cytosol ophthalmics  inc  respectively 
we also manufacture amvisc and amvisc plus  ha viscoelastic supplement products used in ophthalmic surgery  for bausch lomb incorporated 
in december  we entered into a multi year supply agreement the b l agreement with bausch lomb for viscoelastic products used in ophthalmic surgery  including the amvisc and amvisc plus family of products 
under the new agreement  which extends through december   and superseded the existing supply contract that was set to expire december   we will continue to be the exclusive global supplier other than with respect to japan for amvisc and amvisc plus to bausch lomb 
the b l agreement also provides us with a right to negotiate to manufacture future surgical ophthalmic viscoelastic products developed by bausch lomb  while bausch lomb has been granted rights to commercialize certain future surgical ophthalmic viscoelastic products developed by us 
the b l agreement applies to all products sold by us to bausch lomb from the beginning of  with a price increase starting in under the b l agreement  we are entitled to continue providing surgical viscoelastic products to our existing customers eg advanced medical optics  staar surgical company  cytosol ophthalmics  inc who currently receive such products from us 
on july   we announced the signing of an exclusive worldwide development and commercialization partnership for our cta products with the orthoneutrogena division of ortho mcneil pharmaceuticals  inc  an affiliate of johnson johnson 
under the terms of the orthoneutrogena agreement  we received an initial payment of million 
in addition  orthoneutrogena is required  subject to certain limitations  to fund our ongoing pivotal clinical trial of our cta product initiated in may and to support the development of the cta product  as well as future line extensions 
the orthoneutrogena agreement also provides for sales and development based milestone payments in addition to royalty payments and transfer payments for the supply of cta products 
osteoarthritis business we have marketed orthovisc  our product for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee  internationally since through various distribution agreements 
international sales of orthovisc contributed of product revenue for the year ended december  and increased compared to the increase was primarily due to increased market penetration in canada and greece  as well as significant sales increase in turkey 
we expect international sales to grow in compared to reflecting further increased market penetration in certain of our existing markets as well as anticipated expansion into new international markets 
for these new opportunities we have assessed the world market and we are actively pursuing commercial partners 
in december we entered into the obi agreement with ortho biotech for the sales  marketing and distribution of orthovisc in the us and we received marketing approval from the us fda in february for orthovisc 
sales of orthovisc were initiated in march by ortho biotech with the us launch of orthovisc at the annual meeting of the american academy of orthopedic surgeons 
sales of orthovisc in the us contributed of our product revenue for the year ended december  our sales of orthovisc in the us during represented primarily product for the initial product launch and inventory building 
sales of orthovisc to end users grew slower than anticipated in as a result of a number of factors 
we believe that a primary contributing factor to this slower growth has been reimbursement and lack of receiving assignment of a specific reimbursement code 
the healthcare common procedure coding system hcpcs is a comprehensive and standardized coding system that describes classifications of like products that are medical in nature by category for the purpose of efficient claims processing 
hcpcs codes are assigned by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms 
as is typical for a newly introduced medical device  initial sales of orthovisc were made without a unique reimbursement code and reimbursement submissions were made using a miscellaneous code with no specified reimbursement dollar value 
we believe that using the miscellaneous reimbursement code without a specified reimbursement dollar value negatively impacted end user sales of orthovisc in ortho biotech  with our help  submitted an application to secure a unique reimbursement code for orthovisc in march in november  ortho biotech received a decision on the application which assigned a unique reimbursement code to be used by hospitals in an outpatient setting the c code which specifies a reimbursement dollar value 
use of the c code was effective january the cms decision  however  did not assign a unique reimbursement code to be used in the physician office setting the j code because the application filed in march did not reflect the required six months of sales history 
instead of a unique j code  submission for reimbursement of orthovisc is to continue using a miscellaneous j code 
however  under the decision  the dollar value to be reimbursed under the miscellaneous j code is defined 
an application for a unique j code was re submitted in january which  if assigned  will be effective in january there can be no assurance that orthovisc will receive a unique j code 
as a result of the cms decision which did not assign a unique j code for orthosvisc to be effective january we are not entitled to a contractual milestone under the obi agreement that would have been triggered had a unique j code been assigned by a specific date 
the decision by the cms to not assign a unique j code for orthovisc may further adversely impact our orthovisc revenues 
the required use of a miscellaneous j code may result in physician reluctance to utilize orthovisc as compared to if a unique j code had been assigned 
these negative trends are further effected by changes in the categories of revenues we are entitled to under the obi agreement 
in addition to milestone payments  the obi agreement provides for ortho biotech to pay us transfer fees  which are related to sales to ortho biotech  and royalty fees  which are tied to end user sales 
as a result of ortho biotech s inventory buildup during  we presently expect to experience a reduction in transfer fees  which may be offset by royalties as  and if  orthovisc achieves desired market penetration 
as a result of these factors  we did not ship any orthovisc to ortho biotech in the fourth quarter of we expect unit sales of orthovisc to ortho biotech in will be below levels 
we expect the negative impact on our revenues will be partially offset by expected increased royalties we receive on end user sales 
sales of hyvisc  our product for the treatment of equine osteoarthritis  contributed to product revenue for the year ended december  and increased compared to we expect sales of hyvisc to decrease modestly in compared to primarily due to distributor inventory replenishment patterns 
we continue to look at other veterinary applications and opportunities to expand geographic territories 
ophthalmic business our ophthalmic business includes ha viscoelastic products used in ophthalmic surgery 
for the year ended december   sales of ophthalmic products contributed of our product revenue reflecting an increase in sales of ophthalmic products of compared to sales to bausch lomb accounted for of ophthalmic sales for and contributed of product revenue for the period 
in december  we entered into a multi year supply agreement the b l agreement with bausch lomb for viscoelastic products used in ophthalmic surgery 
under the new agreement  which extends through december   and superseded the existing supply contract that was set to expire december   we will continue to be the exclusive global supplier other than with respect to japan for amvisc and amvisc plus to bausch lomb 
the b l agreement also provides us with a right to negotiate to manufacture future surgical ophthalmic viscoelastic products developed by bausch lomb  while bausch lomb has been granted rights to commercialize certain future surgical ophthalmic viscoelastic products developed by us 
the b l agreement applies to all products sold by us to bausch lomb from the beginning of  with a price increase starting in under the b l agreement  we are entitled to continue providing surgical viscoelastic products to our existing customers eg advanced medical optics  staar surgical company  cytosol ophthalmics  inc who currently receive such products from us 
prior to entering into the b l agreement sales to bausch lomb were made under the b l agreement 
under the terms of the b l agreement the price applicable for all units sold to bausch lomb in a calendar year was dependent on the total unit volume of sales of certain ophthalmic products during the year 
in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  revenue is not recognized if the sale price is not fixed or determinable  and any amounts received in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue 
during the fourth quarter the actual annual unit volume became known and we recorded revenue equal to the amounts earned or we provided a rebate to our customer 
in each of the previous three fiscal years ie    the annual unit volume was below levels fixed under our agreement with bausch lomb and  accordingly  in the fourth quarter of each of these years we recognized as revenue the amounts deferred during the first three quarters 
for the nine months ended september   we deferred million related to sales to bausch lomb which was subject to possible retroactive price adjustments 
as a result of entering into the b l agreement  which retroactively applies to sales from the beginning of  we applied the unit pricing terms under the b l agreement to our bausch lomb sales activity 
these terms essentially provide for fixed unit pricing with reduced unit pricing applicable for units purchased in excess of a specified amount during the fiscal year 
as a result of applying this new pricing to transactions  we earned  of revenue which was previously deferred during the first nine months of and rebated  to bausch lomb 
our distributor for coease  advanced medical optics  completed the acquisition of the surgical ophthalmology business of pfizer  inc  in june  which includes a competing line of viscoelastic products for use in ocular surgery 
as a result  our agreement with advanced medical optics has not been renewed and we expect will terminate in july upon its expiration 
we expect sales to advanced medical optics will decline to minimum required levels in accordance with the agreement and to discontinue during the first quarter of as a result  in the future we may not be able to sustain current product revenue levels in our ophthalmic business 
sales to advanced medical optics contributed of ophthalmic product revenue and of total product revenue for the year ended december  research and development our current research and development efforts are focused on our chemically modified formulations of ha designed for longer residence time in the body 
we initiated a us pivotal clinical trial for our product for cosmetic tissue augmentation cta  a therapy for correcting dermal defects  including facial wrinkles  scar remediation and lip augmentation  in may the trial is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of cta for correcting nasolabial folds and is being conducted by dermatologists and plastic surgeons at centers throughout the us patient enrollment was completed during the third quarter of and patients will be monitored for to months following initial treatment 
as discussed above  we are being reimbursed for the clinical trial expenses  subject to certain limitations  in connection with the orthoneutrogena agreement which is included in contract revenue 
in april we initiated a pilot human clinical trial for incert s  a chemically modified form of ha designed to act as a barrier to prevent internal tissue adhesion and scarring following spinal surgery 
the clinical trial is being conducted at two centers in the uk and will involve approximately patients 
as of december   patient enrollment was approximately two thirds complete 
financial overview for the year ended december  net income increased to  or 
per diluted share from  or 
per diluted share for the same period last year 
net income from operations for was  compared to  for revenue we increased sales in each of our product groups for the year ended december  compared to the same period last year 
sales of our ophthalmic products increased  hyvisc sales increased and orthovisc sales increased in compared to the increases in product sales were primarily due to increased sales volume with existing customers and also included the launch of orthovisc in the us license  milestone and contract revenue comprised of total revenue in and consists of the ratable recognition of the upfront and milestone payments received under the obi agreement and contract revenue received under the ortho neutrogena agreement 
cost of product revenue our cost of product revenue includes material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs  obsolescence charges  packaging and shipping costs 
our costs of product revenue may vary over time based on the mix of products sold 
over the past three years we have experienced a decrease in the cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue primarily due to increased manufacturing efficiencies and product volume combined with cost cutting efforts 
gross margin on product revenue for the year ended december  increased to compared to for the year ended december  we expect gross margin on product sales to be relatively consistent in compared to reflecting product mix and comparable manufacturing volume 
research and development our research and development costs consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel and fees paid to outside consultants and outside service providers 
our research and development costs increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period last year primarily due to costs associated with the clinical trials for cta and incert 
we expect to incur additional costs associated with the human clinical trials for our product candidates and to increase personnel related expenses as we expand our research and development efforts 
as a result  we expect research and development costs will increase in compared to selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative costs consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel in executive  finance and accounting  human resources  information technology  and sales and marketing functions 
other costs include professional fees for legal and accounting  fees for consulting and outside services  and insurance costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased compared to the prior year 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses during is primarily due to an increase in professional and outside services fees  including costs for implementation and compliance of section of the sarbanes oxley act of  combined with an increase in personnel related costs 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in compared to as a result of increased personnel related costs as well as expanded marketing efforts for orthovisc and partially offset by lower audit and tax fees and consulting fees for ongoing sarbanes oxley compliance 
income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes for the year ended december  reflecting an effective tax rate of approximately 
as a result of the receipt of the upfront and milestone payments from ortho biotech  we have determined that we will utilize all of our net operating loss and credit carry forwards 
in addition  based on our current expectations regarding future profitability  we released the previously established valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and recorded a one time income tax benefit of million in the first quarter of summary of critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we monitor our estimates on an on going basis for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k for the year ended december  revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize revenue from the sales of products we manufacture upon confirmation of regulatory compliance and shipment to the customer as long as there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred and risk of loss has passed  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
amounts billed or collected prior to recognition of revenue are classified as deferred revenue 
when determining whether risk of loss has transferred to customers on product sales or if the sales price is fixed or determinable we evaluate both the contractual terms and conditions of our distribution and supply agreements as well as our business practices 
orthovisc has been sold through several distribution arrangements as well as outsource order processing arrangements logistic agents 
sales of product through third party logistics agents in certain markets are recognized as revenue upon shipment by the logistics agent to the customer 
under the b l agreement  the price for units sold in a calendar year was dependent on total unit volume of sales to bausch lomb and other customers of certain ophthalmic products during the year 
prices fluctuated based on sales levels  and interim quarters were subject to possible retroactive price adjustments when the actual annual unit volume for the year became known 
given the pricing in this arrangement was not fixed and was determined based on qualifying sales to multiple customers  we determined that we could not reliably estimate the rebate  and accordingly  we deferred the maximum rebate that could be due until the annual sales volume was known in the fourth quarter 
under the b l agreement  the pricing is based solely on ophthalmic products sold to bausch lomb 
while the unit prices will be discounted for those units in excess of cumulative minimum sales levels  no amounts will be rebated 
the applicable discount will be measured quarterly  subject to adjustment based on cumulative annual thresholds 
since quarterly revenue may be adjusted higher or lower depending on the relationship of our quarterly activity relative to our annual goals  we will need to estimate annual unit volume to determine the amount of revenue recognition in each quarter  thereby spreading the discount  if any  across all units purchased in a given annual period 
factors we will consider in developing our estimate include the discount will be based solely on sales activity with bausch lomb who has been a long standing customer of our ophthalmic products  the homogeneous nature of the products purchased under this arrangement  our expected future activity with bausch lomb based on historical experience and product forecasts provided by them  and overall market demand for our ophthalmic products 
in  retroactive application of the bausch lomb agreement resulted in recognition of  of revenue which was previously deferred during the first nine months of and we rebated  to bausch lomb 
in july the company entered into an exclusive worldwide development and commercialization agreement the orthoneutrogena agreement for our cta products with the orthoneutrogena  a division of ortho mcneil pharmaceuticals  inc  an affiliate of johnson johnson 
this arrangement included up front payments  funding of ongoing development activities  milestones upon achievement of predefined goals  in addition  we will receive payments for supply of cta products and royalties on sales 
we believe this is a multiple element arrangement that falls under the scope of eitf under the eitf framework  in order to account for an element as a separate unit of accounting  the element must have stand alone value and there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements 
while this arrangement includes several elements  we believe that two separate units of accounting exist a combined license and development unit and a manufacturing unit under the eitf model 
we are accounting for the combined license and development unit using the performance based model  which recognizes revenue as the efforts are expended limited to the amount of non refundable cash received 
under this arrangement  we received non refundable upfront fees of million and reimbursement for approximately million of costs which were incurred prior to our entering into this arrangement 
we have treated both these amounts as upfront fees that will be recognized over the expected term of the license and development unit 
in addition to the upfront fees  we are receiving reimbursement of pre approved development costs incurred 
for the year ended december  we recognized  as contract revenue for this arrangement under the performance based method 
in december the company entered into a ten year licensing and supply agreement the obi agreement with ortho biotech products  lp  a member of the johnson johnson family of companies  to market orthovisc in the us and mexico 
under the obi agreement  ortho biotech will perform sales  marketing and distribution functions and licensed the right to further develop and commercialize orthovisc as well as other new products for the treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis based on the company s viscosupplementation technology 
in support of the license  the obi agreement provides that ortho biotech will fund post marketing clinical trials for new indications of orthovisc 
the company received an initial payment of million upon entering into the obi agreement  a milestone payment of million in february  as a result of obtaining fda approval of orthovisc and a milestone payment of million in december for planned upgrades to our manufacturing operations 
we evaluated the terms of the obi agreement and determined that the upfront fee and milestone payments did not meet the conditions to be recognized separately from the supply agreement  therefore  we have deferred non refundable payments received of million which we are recognizing ratably over the expected term of the obi agreement  which is currently years 
reserve for obsolete excess inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly review our inventories and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on certain factors that may impact the realizable value of our inventory including  but not limited to  technological changes  market demand  inventory cycle time  regulatory requirements and significant changes in our cost structure 
if ultimate usage varies significantly from expected usage or other factors arise that are significantly different than those anticipated by management  additional inventory write down or increases in obsolescence reserves may be required 
we generally produce finished goods based upon specific orders or in anticipation of specific orders 
as a result  we generally do not establish reserves against finished goods 
under certain circumstances we may purchase raw materials or manufacture work in process or finished goods inventory in anticipation of receiving regulatory approval for the use of the raw materials in our manufacturing process or sale of the finished goods inventory 
we evaluate the value of inventory on a quarterly basis and may  based on future changes in facts and circumstances  determine that a write down of inventory is required in future periods 
deferred tax assets 
we record a deferred tax asset or liability based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities  as measured by the enacted tax rates assumed to be in effect when these differences reverse 
in  we achieved milestones under the obi agreement and received payments totaling million which we recognized as taxable income in as a result  we have determined that we will be able to utilize all of our net operating loss and credit carry forwards in to offset part of our taxable income 
in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  for financial statement purposes  the milestone payments totaling million were deferred and are being recognized ratably over the expected ten year term of the obi agreement 
we recorded a deferred tax asset of million representing the approximate income tax effect of the timing difference of revenue recognition for financial statement purposes and for tax purposes related to these milestone payments as of december  based on management s current expectations regarding future profitability  we released the valuation allowance previously established against our deferred tax assets and recorded a one time income tax benefit of million

under the terms of the b l agreement  which was replaced by the b l agreement in december  the price for all units sold for a calendar year was dependent on the total unit volume of sales of certain ophthalmic products during the year 
accordingly  unit prices for sales occurring in the nine months ended september  and were subject to possible retroactive price adjustments when the actual annual unit volume became known 
in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  the amount of revenue reasonably subject to the price adjustment was recorded as deferred revenue until the annual unit volume became known and the sales price becomes fixed 
in the fourth quarter  as a result of entering into the b l agreement  we applied the terms of the b l agreement retroactively to the beginning of and included in product revenue  of revenue related to sales of amvisc to bausch lomb which had been previously deferred during the first three quarters of and rebated  to bausch lomb

research and development 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased by  or  to  from  for the prior year 
research and development expenses include those costs associated with our in house research and development efforts for the development of new medical applications for our ha based technology  the management and cost of clinical trials  and the preparation and processing of applications for regulatory approvals at all relevant stages of development 
the increase in research and development expenses during is primarily attributable to expenditures associated with the pilot study for incert s initiated in april and the pivotal clinical trial for our product for cosmetic tissue augmentation initiated in may  including costs associated with the start up of the clinical trials incurred in the first quarter of the comparative increase in was partially offset by the elimination of costs primarily incurred in the first half of associated with the completion of our pivotal clinical trial for orthovisc 
our current in house research and development efforts primarily relate to incert  a product designed to prevent surgical adhesions and our products for the cta market 
our research and development efforts will include seeking new applications for the ha molecule as well as our proprietary chemically modified ha and other therapeutics applications of our orthovisc formulation that target osteoarthritis related ailments 
as a result of these ongoing efforts  as well as the ongoing clinical trials  we expect research and development expenses will increase in compared to selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased by  or  to  from  in the prior year 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses during is primarily due to an increase in professional and outside services fees of  combined with an increase in personnel related costs of  compared with the increase in professional and outside services fees included an increase in audit and tax fees and consulting fees of  primarily relating to costs for the implementation and compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in compared to as a result of increased personnel related costs as well as expanded marketing efforts for orthovisc partially offset by lower audit and tax fees and consulting fees for ongoing sarbanes oxley compliance

the decrease in research and development expenses during is primarily attributable to a decrease in costs associated with the pivotal clinical trial for orthovisc which was substantially complete in the first quarter of during expenditures associated with our pivotal clinical trial for orthovisc decreased approximately  compared to expenditures 
in late may we completed compilation of the clinical data and submitted a pma application to the fda as a requirement for seeking us market approval 
our in house research and development efforts relate to incert  a product designed to prevent surgical adhesions and products for the cta market 
our ongoing focus will include second generation versions of our existing ophthalmic and osteoarthritis products  as well as other therapeutics applications of ha 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  decreased by  or  to  from  in the prior year 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses during is primarily due to a decrease in outside services fees of  combined with a decrease in professional service fees of  compared with these decreases reflect lower consulting and selling expenses in addition to lower legal expenses partially offset by an increase in accounting fees 
interest income  net 
interest income  net  decreased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  in the decrease is attributable to lower average cash and investment balances and lower interest rates during income taxes 
we recorded an income tax benefit of  for the year ended december  compared to income tax expense of  for the year ended december  in federal tax law changed to allow for a five year carryback period and a suspension of certain limitations on the use of alternative minimum tax losses 
we filed an income tax carryback claim to carry our tax loss back to prior tax years 
as a result of the carryback claim  in the first quarter of  we received a refund of approximately  of taxes paid in prior years 
the tax benefit was partially offset by a provision for income taxes in the amount of  recorded for federal alternative minimum tax and  for state taxes paid on investment income 
for federal and state income tax purposes  net operating loss carryforwards offset the taxable income which included the million received in december as of december   we have federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively  which may be available to offset future taxable income 
as provided in section of the internal revenue code irc the amount of net operating loss and credit carryforwards that we may utilize in any one year may be restricted in the event of certain changes in ownership 
liquidity and capital resources we require cash to fund our operating expenses and to make capital expenditures 
we expect that our requirements for cash to fund these uses will increase as the scope of our operations expand 
historically we have funded our cash requirements from available cash and investments on hand 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million compared to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million at december  and million at december  we received an initial payment of million in december upon entering into the obi agreement 
in february  we received a milestone payment of million as a result of obtaining fda approval for orthovisc and in december we received a milestone payment of million upon completion of certain manufacturing upgrades 
on an on going and long term basis  the obi agreement also provides for us to receive royalty and transfer fees 
in july we received an initial payment of million upon entering into the orthoneutrogena agreement 
the orthoneutrogena agreement provides for additional performance and sales based milestone payments to the company contingent upon final marketing approval from the fda  receipt of a european ce mark  and upon achievement of other sales and development targets  in addition to royalty and transfer fees 
in addition  orthoneutrogena is required  subject to certain limitations  to fund the ongoing pivotal clinical trial of our cta product initiated in may and to support the development of the cta product  as well as future line extensions 
reimbursable development and clinical expenses incurred through the december  totaled approximately million of which payment for approximately million had been received 
cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december  compared with cash provided by operating activities of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities in resulted primarily from net income of  which includes a one time non cash income tax benefit of  from the release of the previously established valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and an increase in deferred revenue of  the increase in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by an increase in the deferred tax asset of  and a net increase in other current assets and liabilities of  the increase in other current assets and liabilities includes an increase on accounts receivable of  an increase in inventory of  and an increase in prepaid expenses of  partially offset by an increase in current liabilities of  the increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to the million milestone payment received in february and the million milestone payment received in december from ortho biotech 
the increase in prepaid expenses includes  of prepaid income taxes as a result of our estimated federal and state income tax payments totaling approximately million for the year 
cash provided by investing activities was   and  for  and  respectively 
net cash flows from investing activities for includes the release of restricted cash of  which was partially offset by capital expenditures of  primarily for manufacturing and computer equipment 
in connection with the issuance of an irrevocable letter of credit to one of our vendors we had deposited  with our bank to collateralize the letter of credit which amount is recorded in restricted cash at december  these funds were restricted from our use during the term of the letter of credit which expired in april we expect to increase our capital expenditures in primarily for upgrading and expanding our manufacturing and packaging equipment 
cash provided by financing activities of  and  for and  respectively  reflects the proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing techniques except for operating leases as disclosed in the contractual obligations table below that we believe have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas  inventory costs which amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
in addition  sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas is effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb  issued a revision to sfas share based payment  also known as sfas r  that amends existing accounting pronouncements for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee and certain non employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb and generally requires such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
sfas r s effective date would be applicable for awards that are granted  modified  become vested  or settled in cash in interim or annual periods beginning after june  sfas r includes three transition methods one that provides for prospective application and two that provide for retrospective application 
we intend to adopt sfas r prospectively commencing in the third quarter of the fiscal year ending december   it is expected that the adoption of sfas r will cause us to record  as expense each quarter  a non cash accounting charge approximating the fair value of such share based compensation meeting the criteria outlined in the provisions of sfas r  as of december   we had approximately  stock options outstanding which had not yet become vested 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments we have no material commitments for purchases of inventories or property and equipment 
we expect to incur additional investments in our operations through increased inventory levels and balances in accounts receivable for compared to in addition to greater capital expenditures in for manufacturing equipment to meet anticipated higher volume requirements and computers and software and furniture and fixtures associated with normal operations 
to the extent that funds generated from our operations  together with our existing capital resources are insufficient to meet future requirements  we will be required to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financings  strategic alliances with corporate partners and others  or through other sources 
no assurance can be given that any additional financing will be made available to us or will be available on acceptable terms should such a need arise 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend  on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our existing and future products  the success and sales of orthovisc under the obi agreement  the successful commercialization of products in development  progress in our product development efforts  the magnitude and scope of such efforts  progress with pre clinical studies  clinical trials and product clearances by the fda and other agencies  the cost of maintaining adequate manufacturing capabilities  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  the development of strategic alliances for the marketing of certain of our products  and the cost of maintaining adequate inventory levels to meet current and future product demands 
we cannot assure you that we will record profits in future periods 
however  we believe that based on our current strategy  our cash and investments on hand will be sufficient to meet our cash flows requirements beyond see the section captioned risk factors and certain other factors affecting future operating results history of losses  uncertainty of future profitability 
the terms of any future equity financings may be dilutive to our stockholders and the terms of any debt financings may contain restrictive covenants  which could limit our ability to pursue certain courses of action 
our ability to obtain financing is dependent on the status of our future business prospects as well as conditions prevailing in the relevant capital markets 
no assurance can be given that any additional financing may be made available to us or may be available on acceptable terms should such a need arise 
the table below summarizes our contractual obligations of non cancelable operating leases at december  amount thereafter total  risk factors and certain factors affecting future operating results our business is subject to comprehensive and varied government regulation and  as a result  failure to obtain fda or other governmental approvals for our products may materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
product development and approval within the fda framework takes a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources 
there can be no assurance that the fda will grant approval for our new products on a timely basis if at all  or that fda review will not involve delays that will adversely affect our ability to commercialize additional products or expand permitted uses of existing products  or that the regulatory framework will not change  or that additional regulation will not arise at any stage of our product development process which may adversely affect approval of or delay an application or require additional expenditures by us 
in the event our future products are regulated as human drugs or biologics  the fda s review process of such products typically would be substantially longer and more expensive than the review process to which they are currently subject as devices 
our ha products under development  including a product for the cosmetic tissue augmentation market cta  and incert  a product designed to prevent surgical adhesions  have not obtained us regulatory approval for commercial marketing and sale 
we received conformit europ enne marking ce marking  a foreign regulatory approval for commercial marketing and sale  for incert in the third quarter of cta has not received foreign regulatory approval for marketing and sale 
we believe that these products will be regulated as class iii medical devices in the us and will require a pma prior to marketing 
we cannot assure you that we will begin or successfully complete clinical trials for these products  the clinical data will support the efficacy of these products  we will be able to successfully complete the fda or foreign regulatory approval process  where required  or additional clinical trials will support a pma application and or fda approval or foreign regulatory approval  where required  in a timely manner or at all 
we also cannot assure you that any delay in receiving fda approvals will not adversely affect our competitive position 
furthermore  even if we do receive fda approval the approval may include significant limitations on the indications and other claims sought for use for which the products may be marketed  the approval may include other significant conditions of approval such as post market testing  tracking  or surveillance requirements  and meaningful sales may never be achieved 
once obtained  marketing approval can be withdrawn by the fda for a number of reasons  including  among others  the failure to comply with regulatory standards  or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval 
we may be required to make further filings with the fda under certain circumstances 
the fda s regulations require a pma supplement for certain changes if they affect the safety and effectiveness of an approved device  including  but not limited to  new indications for use  labeling changes  the use of a different facility to manufacture  process or package the device  and changes in performance or design specifications 
changes in manufacturing procedures or methods of manufacturing that may affect safety and effectiveness may be deemed approved after a day notice unless the fda requests a day supplement 
our failure to receive approval of a pma supplement regarding the use of a different manufacturing facility or any other change affecting the safety or effectiveness of an approved device on a timely basis  or at all  may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the fda could also limit or prevent the manufacture or distribution of our products and has the power to require the recall of such products 
significant delay or cost in obtaining  or failure to obtain fda approval to market products  any fda limitations on the use of our products  or any withdrawal or suspension of approval or rescission of approval by the fda could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  all fda approved or cleared products manufactured by us must be manufactured in compliance with the fda s good manufacturing practices gmp regulations and  for medical devices  the fda s quality system regulations qsr 
ongoing compliance with qsr and other applicable regulatory requirements is enforced through periodic inspection by state and federal agencies  including the fda 
the fda may inspect us and our facilities from time to time to determine whether we are in compliance with regulations relating to medical device and manufacturing companies  including regulations concerning manufacturing  testing  quality control and product labeling practices 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with current or future fda requirements applicable to the manufacture of products 
fda regulations depend heavily on administrative interpretation and we cannot assure you that the future interpretations made by the fda or other regulatory bodies  with possible retroactive effect  will not adversely affect us 
in addition  changes in the existing regulations or adoption of new governmental regulations or policies could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in  among other things  warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the fda to grant pre market clearance or pre market approval for devices  withdrawal of approvals and criminal prosecution 
in addition to regulations enforced by the fda  we are subject to other existing and future federal  state  local and foreign regulations 
international regulatory bodies often establish regulations governing product standards  packing requirements  labeling requirements  import restrictions  tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve and or maintain compliance required for ce marking or other foreign regulatory approvals for any or all of our products or that we will be able to produce our products in a timely and profitable manner while complying with applicable requirements 
federal  state  local and foreign regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of medical products are subject to change 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  such changes might have on our business 
the process of obtaining approvals from the fda and other regulatory authorities can be costly  time consuming  and subject to unanticipated delays 
we cannot assure you that approvals or clearances of our products will be granted or that we will have the necessary funds to develop certain of our products 
any failure to obtain  or delay in obtaining such approvals or clearances  could adversely affect our ability to market our products 
we have historically incurred operating losses and we cannot make any assurances about our future profitability 
from our inception through december  and through we have incurred annual operating losses 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded net income of million and  respectively  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our ability to maintain profitability is uncertain 
the continued development of our products will require the commitment of substantial resources to conduct research and preclinical and clinical development programs  and the establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or distribution arrangements either by us or our partners 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop these products or new medical applications of our existing products or technology  or that if developed  the necessary regulatory approvals will be obtained  or if obtained  that sales  marketing and distribution capabilities and arrangements will be established in order to permit us to maintain profitability 
substantial competition could materially affect our financial performance 
we compete with many companies  including  among others  large pharmaceutical companies and specialized medical products companies 
many of these companies have substantially greater financial and other resources  larger research and development staffs  more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations and more experience in the regulatory process than us 
we also compete with academic institutions  governmental agencies and other research organizations that may be involved in research  development and commercialization of products 
because a number of companies are developing or have developed ha products for similar applications and have received fda approval  the successful commercialization of a particular product will depend in part upon our ability to complete clinical studies and obtain fda marketing and foreign regulatory approvals prior to our competitors  or  if regulatory approval is not obtained prior to competitors  to identify markets for our products that may be sufficient to permit meaningful sales of our products 
for example  we are aware of several companies that are developing and or marketing products utilizing ha for a variety of human applications 
in some cases  competitors have already obtained product approvals  submitted applications for approval or have commenced human clinical studies  either in the us or in certain foreign countries 
there exists major competing products for the use of ha in ophthalmic surgery 
in addition  certain ha products for the treatment of osteoarthritis in the knee have received fda approval before us and have been marketed in the us since  as well as select markets in canada  europe and other countries 
in december  the fda approved an ha product for the treatment of facial wrinkles which has been marketed internationally since there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete against current or future competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are uncertain regarding the success of our clinical trials 
several of our products will require clinical trials to determine their safety and efficacy for us and international marketing approval by regulatory bodies  including the fda 
we began a pilot human clinical trial in europe for incert s in april and initiated a pivotal clinical trial for our product for cta in may there can be no assurance that we will successfully complete clinical trials of incert s or our cta product or that we will be able to successfully complete the regulatory approval process for either incert s or our cta product 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will not encounter additional problems that will cause us to delay  suspend or terminate the clinical trials 
in addition  we cannot make any assurance that such clinical trials  if completed  will ultimately demonstrate these products to be safe and efficacious 
we are dependent upon marketing and distribution partners and the failure to maintain strategic alliances on acceptable terms will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success will be dependent  in part  upon the efforts of our marketing partners and the terms and conditions of our relationships with such marketing partners 
we cannot assure you that such marketing partners will not seek to renegotiate their current agreements on terms less favorable to us 
under the terms of the b l agreement  effective december   we will continue to be bausch lomb s exclusive global supplier other than with respect to japan of amvisc and amvisc plus ophthalmic viscoelastic products 
the b l agreement expires december   and superseded an existing supply contract with bausch lomb that was set to expire december  the new contract also provides us with a right to negotiate to manufacture future surgical ophthalmic viscoelastic products developed by bausch lomb  while bausch lomb has been granted rights to commercialize certain future surgical ophthalmic viscoelastic products developed by us 
in addition  under certain circumstances  bausch lomb has the right to terminate the agreement  and or the agreement may revert to a non exclusive basis  in each case  we cannot make any assurances that such circumstances will not occur 
for the years ended december  and  sales of amvisc products to bausch lomb accounted for and of total revenues  respectively 
although we intend to continue to seek new ophthalmic product customers  there can be no assurances that we will be successful in obtaining new customers or to achieve meaningful sales to such new customers 
our distributor for coease  advanced medical optics  completed its previously announced acquisition of the surgical ophthalmology business of pfizer  inc in june  which includes a competing line of viscoelastic products for use in ocular surgery 
as a result  our agreement with advanced medical optics has not been renewed and we expect will terminate in july upon its expiration 
we expect that sales to advanced medical optics will decline to minimum required levels in accordance with the agreement and to discontinue during the first quarter of as a result  in the future we may not be able to sustain current product revenue levels in our ophthalmic business 
we have entered into various agreements for the distribution of orthovisc internationally which are subject to termination under certain circumstances 
we are continuing to seek to establish long term distribution relationships in regions not covered by existing agreements  but can make no assurances that we will be successful in doing so 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify or engage appropriate distribution or collaboration partners or effectively transition to any such partners 
there can be no assurance that we will obtain european or other reimbursement approvals or  if such approvals are obtained  they will be obtained on a timely basis or at a satisfactory level of reimbursement 
in december we entered into a ten year licensing and supply agreement with ortho biotech products  lp  a member of the johnson johnson family of companies  to market orthovisc in the us and mexico 
under the obi agreement ortho biotech will perform sales  marketing and distribution functions 
additionally  ortho biotech licensed the right to further develop and commercialize orthovisc products for the treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis 
we cannot assure you that ortho biotech will be able to market orthovisc effectively or to establish sales levels to the extent that anika and ortho biotech believe are possible in the timeframes expected  or at all  nor can we assure you that we will be able to achieve the performance and sales based milestones provided in the obi agreement 
for the year ended december   sales of orthovisc to ortho biotech and royalties tied to end user sales accounted for of total revenue 
furthermore  we cannot predict whether the license granted to ortho biotech in the obi agreement to further develop and commercialize orthovisc products for the treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis based on our viscosupplementation technology will result in any new products or indications for use 
on july   we announced the signing of an exclusive worldwide development and commercialization partnership with orthoneutrogena a division of ortho mcneil pharmaceuticals  inc  an affiliate of johnson johnson  for our cta therapy products 
under the terms of the agreement  orthoneutrogena will  subject to certain limitations  reimburse us for costs incurred for the ongoing pivotal clinical trial with our cta product initiated in may and support the development of the cta product  as well as future line extensions 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully complete the clinical trial for our cta product or that we will be able to successfully complete the fda approval process 
if we are able to successfully complete the fda approval process for our cta product  we cannot assure you that orthoneutrogena will be able to commercialize our cta product effectively  or at all  nor can we assure you that we will be able to achieve the sales and performance based milestones provided in the agreement 
we may need to obtain the assistance of additional marketing partners to bring new and existing products to market and to replace certain marketing partners 
the failure to establish strategic partnerships for the marketing and distribution of our products on acceptable terms will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our future success depends upon market acceptance of our existing and future products 
our success will depend in part upon the acceptance of our existing and future products by the medical community  hospitals and physicians and other health care providers  and third party payers 
such acceptance may depend upon the extent to which the medical community perceives our products as safer  more effective or cost competitive than other similar products 
ultimately  for our new products to gain general market acceptance  it may also be necessary for us to develop marketing partners for the distribution of our products 
there can be no assurance that our new products will achieve significant market acceptance on a timely basis  or at all 
failure of some or all of our future products to achieve significant market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain and enforce patents  protect trade secrets  obtain licenses to technology owned by third parties when necessary  and conduct our business without infringing on the proprietary rights of others 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical  medical products and biotechnology firms  including ours  can be uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
there can be no assurance that any patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or  if any patents are issued  whether they will provide significant proprietary protection or commercial advantage  or will not be circumvented by others 
in the event a third party has also filed one or more patent applications for any of its inventions  we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office pto to determine priority of invention  which could result in failure to obtain  or the loss of  patent protection for the inventions and the loss of any right to use the inventions 
even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us  such interference proceedings could result in substantial cost to us  and diversion of management s attention away from our operations 
filing and prosecution of patent applications  litigation to establish the validity and scope of patents  assertion of patent infringement claims against others and the defense of patent infringement claims by others can be expensive and time consuming 
there can be no assurance that in the event that any claims with respect to any of our patents  if issued  are challenged by one or more third parties  that any court or patent authority ruling on such challenge will determine that such patent claims are valid and enforceable 
an adverse outcome in such litigation could cause us to lose exclusivity covered by the disputed rights 
if a third party is found to have rights covering products or processes used by us  we could be forced to cease using the technologies or marketing the products covered by such rights  could be subject to significant liabilities to such third party  and could be required to license technologies from such third party 
furthermore  even if our patents are determined to be valid  enforceable  and broad in scope  there can be no assurance that competitors will not be able to design around such patents and compete with us using the resulting alternative technology 
we have a policy of seeking patent protection for patentable aspects of our proprietary technology 
we intend to seek patent protection with respect to products and processes developed in the course of our activities when we believe such protection is in our best interest and when the cost of seeking such protection is not inordinate 
however  no assurance can be given that any patent application will be filed  that any filed applications will result in issued patents or that any issued patents will provide us with a competitive advantage or will not be successfully challenged by third parties 
the protections afforded by patents will depend upon their scope and validity  and others may be able to design around our patents 
other entities have filed patent applications for or have been issued patents concerning various aspects of ha related products or processes 
there can be no assurance that the products or processes developed by us will not infringe on the patent rights of others in the future 
any such infringement may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in particular  we received notice from the pto in that a third party was attempting to provoke a patent interference with respect to one of our co owned patents covering the use of incert for post surgical adhesion prevention 
it is unclear whether an interference will be declared 
if an interference is declared it is not possible at this time to determine the merits of the interference or the effect  if any  the interference will have on our marketing of incert for this use 
no assurance can be given that we would be successful in any such interference proceeding 
if the third party interference were to be decided adversely to us  involved claims of our patent would be cancelled  our marketing of the incert product may be materially and adversely affected and the third party may enforce patent rights against us which could prohibit the sale and use of incert products  which could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results 
we also rely upon trade secrets and proprietary know how for certain non patented aspects of our technology 
to protect such information  we require all employees  consultants and licensees to enter into confidentiality agreements limiting the disclosure and use of such information 
there can be no assurance that these agreements provide meaningful protection or that they will not be breached  that we would have adequate remedies for any such breach  or that our trade secrets  proprietary know how  and our technological advances will not otherwise become known to others 
in addition  there can be no assurance that  despite precautions taken by us  others have not and will not obtain access to our proprietary technology 
further  there can be no assurance that third parties will not independently develop substantially equivalent or better technology 
pursuant to the b l agreement  we have agreed to transfer to bausch lomb  upon expiration of the term of the b l agreement on december   or in connection with earlier termination in certain circumstances  our manufacturing process  know how and technical information  which relate to only amvisc products 
upon expiration of the b l agreement  there can be no assurance that bausch lomb will continue to use us to manufacture amvisc and amvisc plus 
if bausch lomb discontinues the use of us as a manufacturer after such time  our business  financial condition  and results of operations would likely be materially and adversely affected 
our manufacturing processes involve inherent risks and disruption could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our results of operations are dependent upon the continued operation of our manufacturing facility in woburn  massachusetts 
the operation of biomedical manufacturing plants involves many risks  including the risks of breakdown  failure or substandard performance of equipment  the occurrence of natural and other disasters  and the need to comply with the requirements of directives of government agencies  including the fda 
in addition  we rely on a single supplier for syringes and a small number of suppliers for a number of other materials required for the manufacturing and delivery of our ha products 
although we believe that alternative sources for many of these and other components and raw materials that we use in our manufacturing processes are available  any supply interruption could harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply is identified and qualified 
we may not be able to find a sufficient alternative supplier in a reasonable time period  or on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  and our ability to produce and supply our products could be impaired 
furthermore  our manufacturing processes and research and development efforts involve animals and products derived from animals 
we procure our animal derived raw materials from qualified vendors  control for contamination and have processes that effectively inactivate infectious agents  however  we cannot assure you that we can completely eliminate the risk of transmission of infectious agents and in the future regulatory authorities could impose restrictions on the use of animal derived raw materials that could impact our business 
the utilization of animals in research and development and product commercialization is subject to increasing focus by animal rights activists 
the activities of animal rights groups and other organizations that have protested animal based research and development programs or boycotted the products resulting from such programs could cause an interruption in our manufacturing processes and research and development efforts 
the occurrence of material operational problems  including but not limited to the events described above  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations during the period of such operational difficulties 
our financial performance depends on the continued growth and demand for our products and we may not be able to successfully manage the expansion of our operations our future success depends on substantial growth in product sales 
there can be no assurance that such growth can be achieved or  if achieved  can be sustained 
there can be no assurance that even if substantial growth in product sales and the demand for our products is achieved  we will be able to develop the necessary manufacturing capabilities  obtain the assistance of additional marketing partners  attract  retain and integrate the required key personnel  implement the financial  accounting and management systems needed to manage growing demand for our products 
our failure to successfully manage future growth could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
if we engage in any acquisition as a part our growth strategy  we will incur a variety of costs  and may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
our business strategy may include the future acquisition of businesses  technologies  services or products that we believe are a strategic fit with our business 
if we undertake any acquisition  the process of integrating an acquired business  technology  service or product may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
moreover  we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition as rapidly as expected or at all 
future acquisitions could reduce stockholders ownership  cause us to incur debt  expose us to future liabilities and result in amortization expenses related to intangible assets with definite lives 
in addition  acquisitions involve other risks  including diversion of management resources otherwise available for ongoing development of our business and risks associated with entering new markets with which we have limited experience or where experienced distribution alliances are not available 
our future profitability may depend in part upon our ability to develop further our resources to adapt to these new products or business areas and to identify and enter into satisfactory distribution networks 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future or consummate future acquisitions 
sales of our products are largely dependent upon third party reimbursement and our performance may be harmed by health care cost containment initiatives 
in the us and other markets  health care providers  such as hospitals and physicians  that purchase health care products  such as our products  generally rely on third party payers  including medicare  medicaid and other health insurance and managed care plans  to reimburse all or part of the cost of the health care product 
we depend upon the distributors for our products to secure reimbursement and reimbursement approvals 
reimbursement by third party payers may depend on a number of factors  including the payer s determination that the use of our products is clinically useful and cost effective  medically necessary and not experimental or investigational 
since reimbursement approval is required from each payer individually  seeking such approvals can be a time consuming and costly process which  in the future  could require us or our marketing partners to provide supporting scientific  clinical and cost effectiveness data for the use of our products to each payer separately 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products  and any failure or delay in obtaining reimbursement approvals can negatively impact sales or our new products 
in addition  third party payers are increasingly attempting to contain the costs of health care products and services by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new therapeutic products and by refusing in some cases to provide coverage for uses of approved products for disease indications for which the fda has not granted marketing approval 
also  congress and certain state legislatures have considered reforms that may affect current reimbursement practices  including controls on health care spending through limitations on the growth of medicare and medicaid spending 
there can be no assurance that third party reimbursement coverage will be available or adequate for any products or services developed by us 
outside the us  the success of our products is also dependent in part upon the availability of reimbursement and health care payment systems 
lack of adequate coverage and reimbursement provided by governments and other third party payers for our products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we may seek financing in the future  which could be difficult to obtain and which could dilute your ownership interest or the value of your shares 
we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million at december  our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend  however  on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our existing and future products  the successful commercialization of products in development  progress in our product development efforts  the magnitude and scope of such product development efforts  progress with preclinical studies  clinical trials and product clearances by the fda and other agencies  the cost and timing of our efforts to manage our manufacturing capabilities and related costs  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  the development of strategic alliances for the marketing of certain of our products  the terms of such strategic alliances  including provisions and our ability to satisfy such provisions that provide upfront and or milestone payments to us  and the cost of maintaining adequate inventory levels to meet current and future product demands 
to the extent that funds generated from our operations  together with our existing capital resources are insufficient to meet future requirements  we will be required to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financings  strategic alliances with corporate partners and others  or through other sources 
the terms of any future equity financings may be dilutive to you and the terms of any debt financings may contain restrictive covenants  which limit our ability to pursue certain courses of action 
our ability to obtain financing is dependent on the status of our future business prospects as well as conditions prevailing in the relevant capital markets 
no assurance can be given that any additional financing will be made available to us or will be available on acceptable terms should such a need arise 
we could become subject to product liability claims  which  if successful  could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the testing  marketing and sale of human health care products entail an inherent risk of allegations of product liability  and there can be no assurance that substantial product liability claims will not be asserted against us 
although we have not received any material product liability claims to date and have an insurance policy of  per occurrence and  in the aggregate to cover such claims should they arise  there can be no assurance that material claims will not arise in the future or that our insurance will be adequate to cover all situations 
moreover  there can be no assurance that such insurance  or additional insurance  if required  will be available in the future or  if available  will be available on commercially reasonable terms 
any product liability claim  if successful  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business is dependent upon hiring and retaining qualified management and scientific personnel 
we are highly dependent on the members of our management and scientific staff  the loss of one or more of whom could have a material adverse effect on us 
we experienced a number of management changes in there can be no assurances that such management changes will not adversely affect our business 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled  scientific  managerial and manufacturing personnel 
we face significant competition for such personnel from other companies  research and academic institutions  government entities and other organizations 
we have been operating without a chief financial officer since october and continue to search for a permanent replacement 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in hiring or retaining the personnel we require  including a permanent chief financial officer 
the failure to hire and retain such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to environmental regulation and any failure to comply with applicable laws could subject us to significant liabilities and harm our business 
we are subject to a variety of local  state and federal government regulations relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture and disposal of toxic  or other hazardous substances used in the manufacture of our products 
any failure by us to control the use  disposal  removal or storage of hazardous chemicals or toxic substances could subject us to significant liabilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our future operating results may be harmed by economic  political and other risks relating to international sales 
during the years ended december  and  approximately  and  respectively  of our product sales were to international distributors 
our representatives  agents and distributors who sell products in international markets are subject to the laws and regulations of the foreign jurisdictions in which they operate and in which our products are sold 
a number of risks are inherent in international sales and operations 
for example  the volume of international sales may be limited by the imposition of government controls  export license requirements  political and or economic instability  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs  difficulties in managing international operations  import restrictions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
such changes in the volume of sales may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our stock price has been and may remain highly volatile  and we cannot assure you that market making in our common stock will continue 
the market price of shares of our common stock may be highly volatile 
factors such as announcements of new commercial products or technological innovations by us or our competitors  disclosure of results of clinical testing or regulatory proceedings  governmental regulation and approvals  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  public concern as to the safety of products developed by us and general market conditions may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock 
the trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  material announcements by us or our competitors  governmental regulatory action  conditions in the health care industry generally or in the medical products industry specifically  or other events or factors  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have particularly affected the market prices of many medical products companies and which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
our operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of equity research analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of our common stock would likely decline  perhaps substantially 
no person is under any obligation to make a market in the common stock or to publish research reports on us  and any person making a market in the common stock or publishing research reports on us may discontinue market making or publishing such reports at any time without notice 
there can be no assurance that an active public market in our common stock will be sustained 
our charter documents contain anti takeover provisions that may prevent or delay an acquisition of us 
certain provisions of our restated articles of organization and amended and restated by laws could have the effect of discouraging a third party from pursuing a non negotiated takeover of us and preventing certain changes in control 
these provisions include a classified board of directors  advance notice to the board of directors of stockholder proposals  limitations on the ability of stockholders to remove directors and to call stockholder meetings  the provision that vacancies on the board of directors be filled by a majority of the remaining directors 
in addition  the board of directors adopted a shareholders rights plan in april we are also subject to chapter f of the massachusetts general laws which  subject to certain exceptions  prohibits a massachusetts corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder 
these provisions could discourage a third party from pursuing a takeover of us at a price considered attractive by many stockholders  since such provisions could have the effect of preventing or delaying a potential acquirer from acquiring control of us and our board of directors 
our revenues are derived from a small number of customers  the loss of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have historically derived the majority of our revenues from a small number of customers  most of whom resell our products to end users and most of whom are significantly larger companies than us 
for the year ended december   three customers accounted for of product revenue 
while it is expected that our ability to market orthovisc in the us will reduce our dependence on revenues from bausch lomb  historically our largest customer  we will still be dependent on a small number of large customers for the majority of our revenues 
our failure to generate as much revenue as expected from these customers or the failure of these customers to purchase our products would seriously harm our business 
in addition  if present and future customers terminate their purchasing arrangements with us  significantly reduce or delay their orders  or seek to renegotiate their agreements on terms less favorable to us  our business  financial condition  and results of operations will be adversely affected 
if we accept terms less favorable than the terms of the current agreement  such renegotiations may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or results of operations 
furthermore  we may be subject to the perceived or actual leverage the customers may have given their relative size and importance to us in any future negotiations 
any termination  change  reduction or delay in orders could seriously harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
accordingly  unless and until we diversify and expand our customer base  our future success will significantly depend upon the timing and size of future purchases by our largest customers and the financial and operational success of these customers 
the loss of any one of our major customers or the delay of significant orders from such customers  even if only temporary  could reduce or delay our recognition of revenues  harm our reputation in the industry  and reduce our ability to accurately predict cash flow  and  as a consequence  could seriously harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
additional costs for complying with recent and proposed future changes in securities and exchange commission  nasdaq stock market and accounting rules could adversely affect our profits 
recent future changes in the securities and exchange commission and nasdaq rules  as well as changes in accounting rules  will cause us to incur additional costs including professional fees  as well as additional personnel costs  in order to keep informed of the changes and operate in a compliant manner 
in addition  we have and continue to expect to incur general and administrative expense as we maintain compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  which requires management to report on  and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  our internal controls 
these costs may be significant enough to cause our financial position and results of operation to be negatively impacted 
in addition  compliance with these new rules could also result in continued diversion of management s time and attention  which could prove to be disruptive to our normal business operations 
failure to comply with any of the new laws and regulations could adversely impact market perception of our company  which could make it difficult to access the capital markets or otherwise finance our operations in the future 
with new rules  including the sarbanes oxley act of  we may have difficulty in retaining or attracting directors for the board and various sub committees thereof or officers 
the recent changes in sec and nasdaq rules  including those resulting from the sarbanes oxley act of  may result in our being unable to attract and retain the necessary board directors and members of sub committees thereof or officers  to effectively provide for our management 
the perceived increased personal risk associated with these recent changes may deter qualified individuals from wanting to participate in these roles 
we may have difficulty obtaining adequate directors and officers insurance and the cost for coverage may significantly increase 
we may have difficulty in obtaining adequate directors and officers insurance to protect us and our directors and officers from claims made against them 
additionally  even if adequate coverage is available  the costs for such coverage may be significantly greater than current costs 
this additional cost may have a significant effect on our profits and as a consequence our results of operations may be adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we did not utilize any derivative financial instruments  market risk sensitive instruments or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under sfas no 
all of our investments consist of money market funds  commercial paper and municipal bonds that are carried on our books at amortized cost  which approximates fair market value 
primary market risk exposures our primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk 
our investment portfolio of cash equivalent is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but we believe this risk is immaterial due to the short term nature of these investments 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure
