item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risks related to our business  including the information under the heading we are dependent upon international sales and there are many risks associated with international operations for information about the risks associated with our international operations 
also see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the majority of our international sales are currently invoiced in us dollars 
however  we do enter into certain transactions in euros and other currencies 
invoicing in other currencies subjects us to risks associated 
table of contents with foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
although we do not currently have any foreign currency hedging arrangements in place  we will consider the need for hedging or other strategies to minimize these risks if the amount of invoicing in non dollar denominated transactions materially increases 
our international operations are subject to certain risks common to foreign operations in general  such as governmental regulations and import restrictions 
in addition  there are social  political  labor and economic conditions in specific countries or regions as well as difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  and potential adverse foreign tax consequences  among other factors that could also have an impact on our business and results of operations outside of the united states 
customer service and technical support we believe that our ability to provide consistently high quality service and support will continue to be a key factor in attracting and retaining customers 
our technical services and support organization  with personnel in north america  emea and asia  offers support hours a day  seven days per week 
prior to the deployment of our products  each customer s needs are assessed and proactive solutions are implemented  including various levels of training  periodic management and coordination meetings and problem escalation procedures 
backlog most of our revenues are generated from orders booked and shipped within the current quarter 
assuming product availability  our practice is to ship our products promptly upon the receipt of purchase orders from our customers 
therefore  we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business 
manufacturing our finished goods are produced by subcontract manufacturers 
our video equipment is single sourced from a manufacturer in san jose  california 
our modems are sourced from a manufacturer in china 
our manufacturing operations employ semiconductors  electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials such as plastic resins and sheet metal 
although we believe the materials and supplies necessary for our manufacturing operations are currently available in the quantities required  we sometimes experience a short supply of certain component parts as a result of strong demand in the industry for those parts 
our subcontractors purchase materials  supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors 
for many of our products  there are existing alternate sources of supply 
however  we sole source certain components contained in our products  such as the semiconductors used in our products 
while this has not resulted in material disruptions in the past  should any change in these relationships or disruptions to our vendors operations occur  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
in an effort to prevent shortages of supplies used in the manufacturing process by some of our subcontractors  we source and inventory various raw products and components  as part of our supply chain program 
in doing so we may put ourselves at risk of carrying inventory that may become excessive for our future sales  based on current sales forecasts or become obsolete before utilization by those manufactures 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products 
even though we seek to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products  there are risks 
our pending patent applications may not be granted 
even if they are granted  the claims covered by the patent may be reduced from those included in our applications 
any patent might be subject to challenge in court and  whether or not challenged  might not be broad enough to prevent third parties from developing equivalent technologies or products without a license from us 

table of contents we have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees  and we enter into non disclosure agreements with many of our suppliers  distributors and appropriate customers so as to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information 
these contractual arrangements  as well as statutory protections  may not prove to be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter independent third party development of similar technologies 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights 
in connection with the development of the docsis specification by cablelabs  the research and development consortium  which the cable operators help fund we entered into an agreement with cablelabs whereby we licensed to cablelabs on a royalty free basis all of our intellectual property rights to the extent that such rights may be asserted against a party desiring to design  manufacture or sell docsis based products  including docsis based products 
this license agreement grants to cablelabs the right to sublicense our intellectual property  including our intellectual property rights in our s cdma patents  to others  including manufacturers that compete with us in the marketplace for docsis based products 
to migrate their networks to all digital operation  comcast  time warner and cox  the three largest cable operators in the us  started their next generation network architecture ngna initiative in to develop a common approach to transform their cable systems into all digital networks 
working as a group the operators can work more effectively with equipment vendors in defining the products and product capabilities required for the migration 
in the participating operators commissioned cablelabs to manage the ngna initiative and to develop a set of standards to which equipment vendors like us can build our products 
the ngna initiative is so far following the model successfully proven with the earlier docsis initiative  which enabled the development of interoperable cable modems  cmtss and other associated equipment that allowed us operators to rollout broadband cable modem service much faster  more broadly and with greater success than telecom carriers could offer their competing dsl service 
as it has with data services  cablelabs may request companies to contribute their video technologies to a docsis like technology pool on a royalty free basis 
the contractual arrangements  as well as statutory protections  we employ may not prove to be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter independent third party development of similar technologies 
we have in the past received letters claiming that our technology infringes the intellectual property rights of others 
we have consulted with our patent counsel and have or are in the process of reviewing the allegations made by such third parties 
if these allegations were submitted to a court  the court could find that our products infringe third party intellectual property rights 
if we are found to have infringed third party rights  we could be subject to substantial damages and or an injunction preventing us from conducting our business 
in addition  other third parties may assert infringement claims against us in the future 
a claim of infringement  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert our management s resources  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
these royalty or licensing arrangements may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
we pursue the registration of our trademarks in the united states and have applications pending to register several of our trademarks throughout the world 
however  the laws of certain foreign countries might not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
effective trademark  copyright  trade secret and patent protection may not be available in every country in which our products may be manufactured  marketed or sold

item legal proceedings beginning in april  several plaintiffs filed class action lawsuits in federal court against us and certain of our officers and directors 
later that year  the cases were consolidated in the united states district court  northern district of california as in re terayon communication systems  inc securities litigation 
the court then appointed lead plaintiffs who filed an amended complaint 
in  the court granted in part and denied in part defendants motion to dismiss  and plaintiffs filed a new complaint 
in  the court denied defendants motion to dismiss that complaint  which  like the earlier complaints  alleges that the defendants violated the federal securities laws by issuing materially false and misleading statements and failing to disclose material information regarding our technology 
on february   the court certified a plaintiff class consisting of those who purchased or otherwise acquired our securities between november  and april  on september   the court heard defendants motion to disqualify two of the lead plaintiffs and to modify the definition of the plaintiff class 
on september   the court issued an order vacating the hearing date for the parties summary judgment motions  and  on september   the court issued another order staying all discovery until further notice and vacating the trial date  which had been november  on february   the court issued an order disqualifying two of the lead plaintiffs 
the order also states that plaintiffs counsel must provide certain information to the court about counsel s relationship with the disqualified lead plaintiffs  and it provides that defendants may serve certain additional discovery 
on march   plaintiffs submitted certain documents to the court in response to its order  and  on april  
table of contents  we responded to this submission 
we also have initiated discovery pursuant to the court s february  order 
on october   a lawsuit was filed against us and the individual defendants zaki rakib  selim rakib and raymond fritz in the california superior court  san luis obispo county 
this lawsuit is titled bertram v 
terayon communications systems  inc the factual allegations in the bertram complaint were similar to those in the federal class action  but the bertram complaint sought remedies under state law 
defendants removed the bertram case to the united states district court  central district of california  which dismissed the complaint and transferred the case to the united states district court  northern district of california 
that court eventually issued an order dismissing the case 
plaintiffs have appealed this order  and their appeal was heard on april  on june   the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed the order dismissing the bertram case 
the court of appeals opinion affirming dismissal of the bertram case does not end the class action 
we believe that the allegations in the class action are without merit  and we intend to contest this matter vigorously 
this matter  however  could prove costly and time consuming to defend  and there can be no assurances about the eventual outcome 
in  two shareholders filed derivative cases purportedly on behalf of us against certain of our current and former directors  officers  and investors 
the defendants differed somewhat in the two cases 
since the cases were filed  the investor defendants have been dismissed without prejudice  and the lawsuits have been consolidated as campbell v 
rakib in the california superior court  santa clara county 
we are a nominal defendant in these lawsuits  which allege claims relating to essentially the same purportedly misleading statements that are at issue in the pending securities class action 
in the securities class action  we dispute making any misleading statements 
the derivative complaints also allege claims relating to stock sales by certain of the director and officer defendants 
we believe that there are many defects in the campbell and o brien derivative complaints 
on january   omniband group limited  a russian company omniband  filed a request for arbitration with the zurich chamber of commerce  claiming damages in the amount of  allegedly caused by the breach of an agreement by us  terayon communications systems ltd 
terayon ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary  radwiz ltd  radwiz  a former wholly owned subsidiary to sell to omniband certain equipment pursuant to an agreement between omniband and radwiz 
on december   the panel of arbiters with the zurich chamber of commerce allowed the arbitration proceeding to continue against radwiz but dismissed the proceeding against us and terayon ltd 
omniband appealed the zurich chamber of commerce s decision to dismiss the proceeding against us and terayon ltd 
and the decision was affirmed on october  on january   the zurich chamber of commerce dismissed the case with prejudice after omniband failed to respond and pay the arbitration fees 
in january  adelphia corporation sued us in the district court of the city and county of denver  colorado 
adelphia s complaint alleges  among other things  breach of contract and misrepresentation in connection with our sale of cmts products to adelphia and our announcement to cease future investment in the cmts market 
adelphia seeks unspecified monetary damages and declaratory relief 
we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on february  as we believe that adelphia s allegations are without merit  we intend to contest this matter vigorously 
this matter  however  could prove costly and time consuming to defend  and there can be no assurances about the eventual outcome we have received letters claiming that our technology infringes the intellectual property rights of others 
we have consulted with our patent counsel and have or are in the process of reviewing the allegations made by such third parties 
if these allegations were submitted to a court  the court could find that our products infringe third party intellectual property rights 
if we are found to have infringed third party rights  we could be subject to substantial damages and or an injunction preventing us from conducting our business 
in addition  other third parties may assert infringement claims against us in the future 
a claim of infringement  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert our management s resources  
table of contents cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
these royalty or licensing arrangements may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
furthermore  we have in the past agreed to  and may from time to time in the future agree to  indemnify a customer of its technology or products for claims against the customer by a third party based on claims that our technology or products infringe intellectual property rights of that third party 
these types of claims  meritorious or not  can result in costly and time consuming litigation  divert management s attention and other resources  require us to enter into royalty arrangements  subject us to damages or injunctions restricting the sale of our products  require us to indemnify our customers for the use of the allegedly infringing products  require us to refund payment of allegedly infringing products to our customers or to forgo future payments  require us to redesign certain of our products  or damage our reputation  any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are currently a party to various other legal proceedings  in addition to those noted above  and may become involved from time to time in other legal proceedings in the future 
while we currently believe that the ultimate outcome of these other proceedings  individually and in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall results of operations  litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties 
were an unfavorable ruling to occur in any of our legal proceedings  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our results of operations for the period in which the ruling occurs 
the estimate of the potential impact on our financial position and overall results of operations for any of the above legal proceedings could change in the future

the discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview we sell our dvs products to cable operators  satellite providers and television broadcasters 
additionally  we sell our has products  including cable modems  emtas  home networking devices  and cmts product line to cable operators 
however  in we ceased investment in our cmts product line and currently anticipate very limited sales of this product line in when the downturn in the communications industry started in fiscal and became fully evident to us in fiscal  we began to implement restructuring plans to cease certain product lines  reduce operating expenses and capital spending and to narrow the focus of our business 
furthermore  in  and  as part of our restructuring efforts to refocus our business  we sold or ceased investing in certain product lines and took additional measures to align our cost structure with revenues 
our most recent restructuring plans  beginning in the first quarter of and continuing throughout  resulted in a worldwide reduction in force of approximately employees  or of the workforce  consolidation of certain facilities  and reduction or elimination of certain discretionary costs and programs 
we may continue to divest unprofitable product lines in an effort to focus on growing our business profitably and redirect our resources to our dvs product line 
however  despite these actions  we may not be able to meet expected revenue levels in any particular period or attain profitability in any future period 
in  we repositioned ourselves to make dvs the center of our business strategy 
as part of this vision  we began expanding our focus and our efforts beyond cable operators to more aggressively pursue opportunities for our dvs products with other broadband providers and television broadcasters 
additionally  as part of this decision  we also determined that we would continue to sell has products but cease future investment in our cmts product line 
this decision was based on weak and declining sales of the cmts products and the anticipated costs associated with the extensive research and development investment required to support the product line 
as part of our decision to cease investment in the cmts product line  we have incurred severance  restructuring charges and asset impairment charges 

table of contents the emerging market trend to standardize the digital video technology may challenge our ability to continue to grow our dvs business 
comcast  time warner and cox  the three largest cable operators in the us  started their ngna initiative in to develop a common approach to transform their cable systems into all digital networks 
in the participating operators commissioned cablelabs to manage the ngna initiative and to develop a set of standards to which equipment vendors can build their products to enable the migration to all digital networks 
as it has with data services  cablelabs may request or even require companies to contribute their video technologies to a docsis like technology pool on a royalty free basis 
if this initiative is successful  we expect that cable operators would seek to purchase video products that have been certified or qualified by cablelabs  in which case we will not be able to sell our video products until they achieve certification or qualification  which can be a lengthy process 
as a result  we may incur significant research and development expenses to develop new video products that may not receive certification or qualification in which case we may not be able to recoup the costs of these research and development expenses 
moreover  there is no guarantee that we will be able to support all future cable industry specifications relating to video products  which would likely have an adverse impact on our future revenues 
furthermore  a potential consequence of cable operators purchasing only certified or qualified products is the increased competition between equipment vendors  which could result in declining prices 
consequently  our future success may depend on our ability to compete effectively in the video marketplace by developing  marketing and selling products that are certified and qualified to industry standards in a timely fashion and in a cost effective manner 
on february   we announced the signing of an agreement with ati technologies  inc ati relating to the sale of certain cable modem semiconductor assets 
the agreement calls for ati to acquire our cable modem silicon intellectual property and related software  assume a lease and hire approximately twenty five employees of our design team 
under the terms of the agreement  ati will pay us million upon closing  with a balance of million subject to us achieving milestones for certain conditions  services and deliverables spanning a period of months 
on march  we signed closing documents with ati for this agreement 
upon closing we received million in cash which was comprised of the million for the initial payment and million of the million for having met the first milestone 
the difference between the million milestone and the payment of million was money retained by ati to pay for company funded retention bonuses for employees that accepted employment with ati 
the balance of million will be subject to our achieving the remaining milestones over the subsequent months 
the maximum liability for us is set at million or the total amount of the purchase price paid by ati plus million 
total purchase price payable to us upon achieving all terms and conditions is million 
as set forth in this agreement are representations and warranties made by us that may cause us to incur liabilities and penalties arising out of our failure to meet certain conditions and milestones 
we have not been profitable since our inception 
we had a net loss of million or per share for the year ended december   and a net loss of million or per share for the year ended december  our ability to grow our business and attain profitability is dependent on our ability to effectively compete in the marketplace with our current products and services  develop and introduce new products and services  contain operating expenses and improve our gross margins  as well as continued investment in equipment by the broadband provider industry 
finally  we expect to benefit from a lower expense base resulting in part from the series of restructurings that occurred in along with continued focus on cost containment 
however  despite these efforts  we may not succeed in attaining profitability in the near future  if at all 
at december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as compared to approximately million at december  the decrease in the amount of cash and cash equivalents in as compared to primarily resulted from significant uses of cash for operating activities  payments for inventory  restructuring charges and executive severance in although we believe that our current cash balances will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next months  we may need to raise additional funds in order to support more rapid expansion  develop new or enhanced services  respond to competitive pressures  acquire complementary businesses or technologies or 
table of contents respond to unanticipated requirements 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to continue operations  develop products  take advantage of future opportunities  respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results a more detailed description of the risks to our business can be found in the section captioned risk factors in this annual report 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and revenues for the year ended december  annual change in thousands revenues our revenues increased to million for the twelve months ended december  from million in  primarily due to increased sales of dvs and has products  particularly in the second half of  partially offset by declining sales of our cmts products and proprietary s cdma cmts products 
revenues by groups of similar products for the year ended december  annual change in thousands revenues by product dvs has cmts other total revenues from dvs products increased in compared to  due to increased demand for our hd and ad insertion applications 
we introduced several new products in  one of which the bp serves the broadcast market segment 
has product revenues increased in compared to  primarily due to an aggregate increase in modem volume  million units in as compared to million units in  offset by decreases in average selling price asp 
the number of docsis modems sold increased to million units in from million units in the intensely competitive nature of the market for broadband products resulted in significant price erosion 
we anticipate that modem unit price erosion will continue in the first half of however  we believe that our full transition to an original design manufacturer odm in asia during may allow us to remain competitive in the marketplace and maintain favorable margins on these products 
our cmts product revenues decreased in compared to  as new customer adoption of docsis cmts platform was not as robust as originally anticipated 
due to declining sales  we made an announcement in october to cease investment in the cmts product line 
we expect cmts revenues to continue to decline in as we phase out this product line and focus on our growth areas 

table of contents other product revenues increased in compared to  due to large  last time purchases of our legacy voice products 
we do not expect any sales of our legacy voice products in revenues by geographic region for the year ended december  annual change in thousands revenues by geographic areas united states americas  excluding united states emea  excluding israel israel asia  excluding japan japan total revenues in the united states increased to million in  up from million in  due to increased sales of has and dvs products to major system operators mso and television broadcasters 
revenues for emea  excluding israel  increased to million in up from million in during  we emphasized sales to our us  emea  japanese and other asian customers while placing a lower emphasis on other locations such as canada and south america 
in  we expect revenues to increase in the united states  asian and emea markets 
significant customers two customers  adelphia and comcast   and  respectively accounted for more than of our total revenues for the year ended december  three customers  adelphia  cross beam networks and comcast   and  respectively accounted for more than of our total revenues for the year ended december  in connection with our decision in october to cease future investment in our cmts product line and their related lawsuit  we do not expect adelphia to continue to purchase equipment from us 
while sales in prior years from adelphia were primarily related to cmts products  we expect this to have a material adverse impact on our has product line in and may affect dvs sales as well 
related party revenues for the year ended december  annual change in thousands related party revenues rogers revenues harmonic revenues total related party revenues related party revenues increased in compared to related party revenues in were from harmonic  inc harmonic 
related party revenues in included revenues from harmonic and rogers communications  inc rogers 
lewis solomon  a member of our board of directors  is a member of the board of directors of harmonic 
all revenues attributable to harmonic were included in related party revenues in and alek krstajic  another member of our board of directors  was the senior vice president of interactive services  sales and product development for rogers until january effective in 
table of contents april  rogers was no longer a related party to us 
consequently  revenues attributable to rogers are only classified as related party revenues in the first quarter of the increase in related party revenues was primarily due to increase in sales to harmonic in neither harmonic nor rogers is a supplier to us 
in december  we entered into co marketing arrangements with shaw communications  inc shaw and rogers 
we paid million to shaw and million to rogers  and recorded these amounts as other current assets 
in july  we began amortizing these prepaid assets and charging them against related party revenues in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or reseller in connection with the purchase or promotion of the vendor s products 
we charged million per quarter of the amortization of these assets against total revenues through december  amounts charged against total revenues in the year ended december   totaled approximately million 
of the co marketing amortization charged to total revenues  million was charged to related party revenues in the year ended these co marketing arrangements were fully amortized at december  and no further amortization has occurred in cost of goods sold and gross profit for the year ended december  annual change in thousands cost of product revenues cost of related party revenues total cost of goods sold gross profit cost of goods sold consists of direct product costs as well as the cost of our manufacturing operations 
the cost of manufacturing includes contract manufacturing  test and quality assurance for products  warranty costs and associated costs of personnel and equipment 
in  cost of goods sold was approximately of revenues compared to of revenues in cost of goods sold in and included the benefit of reversals of approximately million and million  respectively  in special charges taken in and for vendor cancellation charges and inventory previously reserved as excess and obsolete 
we reversed these provisions as we were able to sell inventory originally considered to be excess and obsolete 
in addition  we were able to negotiate downward certain vendor cancellation claims on terms more favorable to us 
during  we recorded inventory charges of million  principally due to our decision to cease investment in the cmts product line 
in  we recorded inventory charges of million to reduce our inventory due to excess and obsolescence 
in  related party cost of goods increased compared to due to increased sales of our products to harmonic 
our gross profit increased million or to million or of revenue in the year ended december  compared to million  or of revenue in the factors that contributed to the increase in our gross profit in were primarily related to an improved sales mix  increased sales of the higher margin dvs product line and lower manufacturing costs for certain has products 
these positive factors were offset by sales of cmts products during the same period and increased cmts reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
during we anticipate further decreases in our asps and continued pressure on our has margins 
consequently  we continue to focus on improving sales of higher margin products and reducing product manufacturing costs for all our products  but most particularly for our has products 
we are now partnering with contract manufacturers in asia and the us for our has and dvs products  respectively  which may provide us with more competitive component pricing  economies of scale and improved manufacturing capabilities 
in addition  we are currently evaluating possible outsourcing partnerships for certain of our supply chain functions  with the objective of increasing our focus on our core competencies  reducing our costs  and 
table of contents leveraging our target partners capabilities 
to the extent that we are successful in shifting our product mix to higher margin dvs product revenues  we expect our margins to increase 
operating expenses for the year ended december  annual change in thousands research and development sales and marketing general and administrative research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  internally designed prototype material expenditures  and expenditures for outside engineering consultants  equipment and supplies required in developing and enhancing our products 
research and development expenses decreased million or to million or of revenue in the year ended december  from million or of revenue in the million decrease in research and development expenses was attributable to million of reductions in employee related expenses and million in depreciation and amortization 
the decrease in research and development expense also included reductions of million in expenses for outside engineering consultants  million of reductions in materials costs incurred to develop prototypes  and million in other costs as a result of the reduction in research and development personnel for cmts product line 
we believe it is critical to continue to make significant investments in research and development to create innovative technologies and products that meet the current and future requirements of our customers 
accordingly  we intend to continue our investment in research and development although at slightly lower levels 
in connection with our ongoing restructuring activities  we currently expect research and development expenses to continue to decrease in sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  including salaries  commissions for sales  marketing and support personnel  and costs related to trade shows  consulting and travel 
sales and marketing expenses decreased by million or to million or of revenue in the year ended december  from million or of revenue in the largest components of the decrease in sales and marketing expenses were million related to savings realized from subleasing our corporate jet  million of decreased travel and facilities costs  and million of reduction in depreciation and amortization 
these savings were offset by increased expenses of million for outside consultants 
in connection with our ongoing restructuring activities  we currently expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to decrease in general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs of administrative officers and support personnel  travel expenses and legal  accounting and consulting fees 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million or to million or of revenue in the year ended december  from million or of revenue in the decrease was primarily due to million in reduced employee expenses due to lower headcount  partially offset by an increase of million attributable to executive recruitment costs  million of decreased spending for facilities related to the restructuring plans and a decrease of million depreciation and amortization costs

table of contents restructuring charges  executive severance and asset write offs for the year ended december  in thousands restructuring charges executive severance long lived assets written off subtotal restructuring recovery change in estimate in prior year plans restructuring charges  executive severance and asset write offs restructuring during the year  we initiated a series of restructuring plans approved by our board of directors to bring operating expenses in line with our revenue levels and to cease investment in our cmts product line 
in the first quarter  we incurred restructuring charges in the amount of million of which million was related to employee termination costs  million related to termination costs for an aircraft lease  and million related to costs for excess leased facilities 
net charges accrued under this first quarter plan  included estimated sublease income from the aircraft and the excess leased facilities 
we incurred restructuring charges in the amount of million in the second quarter of related to additional costs for excess leased facilities  which were contemplated in the first quarter restructuring plan 
in the fourth quarter to further conform our expenses to revenue and to cease investment in the cmts product line  we initiated a third restructuring plan that resulted in a charge in the amount of million related to employee terminations in the second  third and fourth quarters of  we re evaluated the first and second quarter restructuring charges for the employee severance  excess leased facilities and the aircraft lease termination 
based on market conditions  changes in estimates provided by our broker  and the terms of the aircraft sublease agreement  which we entered into in the third quarter of  we increased the restructuring charge for the aircraft lease by a total of million  the facilities accrual was increased million and employee severance accrual was decreased by million 
net charges for the restructuring plans totaled million  comprised of million for employee terminations  million in aircraft lease and million for leased facilities 
a total of employees worldwide or of our workforce has been terminated 
we anticipate the remaining restructuring accrual  net of the sublease income related to the aircraft  to be substantially utilized for servicing operating lease payments through january  and the remaining restructuring accrual related to excess leased facilities to be utilized for servicing operating lease payments or negotiating a buyout of operating lease commitments through october the amount of net charges accrued under the restructuring plans assumes that we will successfully sublease excess leased facilities 
the reserve for the aircraft lease and excess leased facilities approximates the difference between our current costs for the aircraft and excess leased facilities and the estimated income derived from subleasing  which is based on information derived by our brokers that estimated real estate market conditions as of the date of our implementation of the restructuring plan and the time it would likely take to fully sublease the excess leased facilities 
even though it is our intent to sublease our interests in the excess facility at the earliest possible time  we cannot determine with certainty a fixed date by which such events will occur  if at all 
in light of this uncertainty  we will continue to periodically re evaluate and adjust the reserve  as necessary 
as of december   million remained accrued for all of the plans 
this is comprised of million for employee termination  million for aircraft lease and million for facilities 

table of contents during the first quarter of  our board of directors approved a restructuring plan plan to conform our expenses to our revenue levels and to better position us for future growth and eventual profitability

during  another restructuring plan plan was approved by the board of directors  which increased the reserve for excess leased facilities due to the exiting of additional space within the same facility in israel 
we incurred restructuring charges in the amount of million for the plan 
improving real estate market conditions in israel in the early part of gave rise to our improved tenant sublease assumptions thereby creating a change in estimate in the plan and plans of million  leaving an accrual of million at december  for these plans 
the restructuring accrual as of december  for all plans totals million of which million is accrued for employee terminations  million for aircraft lease termination and million for leased facilities 
the balance of the employee termination charges were paid in the first quarter of executive severance in june  we entered into an employment agreement with an executive officer

beginning in  the telecom segment no longer met the quantitative threshold for disclosure and we operated as one business segment 
our revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million in  primarily due to increased sales of docsis cmts and has products  particularly in the second half of the revenue increase derived from increased sales of docsis cmts and has products was partially offset by declining sales of our proprietary s cdma  cmts and has products and telecom products

we adopted sfas goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas on january  we tested goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
we completed the initial goodwill impairment review as of the beginning of  and found no impairment 
due to a difficult economic environment and heightened price competition in the modem and telecom businesses during the three months ended june   we experienced a significant drop in our market capitalization  and therefore proceeded to perform an interim test to measure goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at june  based on our forecast  the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of the goodwill would be less than its carrying amount

we discuss each of our critical accounting policies  in addition to certain less significant accounting policies  with senior members of management and the audit committee  as appropriate 
use of estimate the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to establish accounting policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these policies include revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  which impacts revenue  the valuation of exposures associated with the contract manufacturing operations and estimating future warranty costs  which impact cost of good sold and gross margins  and the valuation of certain long lived assets  especially goodwill and other purchased intangible assets  which has resulted in impairment  which impacts operating expenses 
we employ other equally important accounting policies and practices  which may not require us to make significant estimates or assumptions 
despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and assumptions  actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition sab 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services were rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
contracts and customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
delivery occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier 
certain of our products are delivered on an fob 
table of contents destination basis 
we defer our revenue associated with these transactions until the delivery has occurred to the customers premises 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
should there be changes to management s judgments  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
we sell our products directly to broadband service providers  and to a lesser extent resellers 
revenue arrangements with resellers are recognized when product is shipped to the resellers as we do not grant return rights beyond those provided by the warranty 
our service revenue  which is sold separately from product lines represented approximately and of revenue for the year ended december  and  respectively 
it is generated from service arrangements for product support  which is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  typically one year 
product support includes internet access to technical content  software updates  as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel 
allowance for doubtful accounts we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral 
we evaluate our trade receivables based upon a combination of factors 
credit losses have historically been within management s expectations 
when we become aware of a customer s inability to pay  such as in the case of bankruptcy or a decline in the customer s operating results or financial position  we record an allowance to reduce the related receivable to an amount we reasonably believe is collectible 
we maintain an allowance for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable based on an assessment of collectibility 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including history  the number of days an amount is past due based on invoice due date  changes in credit ratings of customers  current events and circumstances regarding the business of our client s customers and other factors that we believe are relevant 
if circumstances related to a specific customer change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further reduced 
in  we experienced better than expected collections of million offset by write offs of  at december  and  the allowance for potentially uncollectible accounts was million and million  respectively 
inventory valuation we record losses on commitments to purchase inventory in accordance with statement of chapter of accounting release bulletin no 
our policy for valuation of inventory and commitments to purchase inventory  including the determination of obsolete or excess inventory  requires us to perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date which includes a review of  among other factors  an estimate of future demand for products within specific time horizons  generally six months or less as well as product lifecycle and product development plans 
given the rapid technological change in the technology and communications equipment industries as well as significant  unpredictable changes in capital spending by our customers  we believe that assessing the value of inventory using generally a six month time horizon is appropriate 
the estimates of future demand that we use in the valuation of inventory are the basis for the revenue forecast  which is also consistent with our short term manufacturing plan 
based on this analysis  we reduce the cost of inventory that we specifically identify and consider obsolete or excessive to fulfill future sales estimates 
we define excess inventory as inventory that will no longer be used in the manufacturing process 
excess inventory is generally defined as inventory in excess of projected usage  and is determined using our best estimate of future demand at the time  based upon information then available 
we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products 
during the normal course of business  in order to manage manufacturing lead times often ranging from three to six months and to help ensure adequate component supply  we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our component supply 
table of contents requirements 
if we were to curtail or cease production of certain products or terminate these agreements  we may be liable for vendor cancellation charges 
we accrue for vendor cancellation charges which increase cost of goods sold which represent management s estimate of our financial exposure to vendors should our management curtail or cease production of certain products or terminate a vendor or supplier agreement 
estimates of exposure are determined using vendor inventory data 
should we change our short term manufacturing plans such that further products or components would no longer be used  additional vendor cancellation charges may occur 
at december   accrued vendor cancellation charges were million which are expected to become payable in the next three to six months 
from time to time we have been able to reverse portions of our vendor cancellation accrual as we were able to negotiate downward certain vendor cancellation charges 
such reversals of vendor cancellation charges cause a decrease in cost of goods sold in the period during which such charges are reversed 
for the twelve months ended december   we reversed approximately million of vendor cancellation charges as a result of consumed inventory and favorable negotiations with vendors 
impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets have principally included long term investments  goodwill and other intangible assets 
our estimate of the fair value of the long term investments was dependent on the performance of the companies in which we have invested  as well as the volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments 
if the companies business forecasts were not met  we had to record additional impairment charges 
at december   all of our long term investments  goodwill and other intangible assets had been written off and we had no such assets recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at december  and warranty reserves we provide a standard warranty for most of our products  ranging from one to five years from the date of purchase 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and our expectation of future conditions 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revision to the warranty liability would be required  resulting in decreased gross profits 
restructuring and other related charges during  and we implemented restructuring programs to focus and streamline our business and reduce operating expenses 
in connection with these programs  we reduced headcount  abandoned facilities and wrote off inventory 
as a result of these actions  we recorded restructuring and other related charges primarily consisting of cash severance payments made to terminated employees  lease payments related to property abandoned as a result of our facilities consolidation and lease payments related to an aircraft lease 
each reporting period  we review these estimates based on the execution of our restructuring plans and changing market conditions  such as the real estate market and other assumptions and  as needed  record appropriate adjustments 
to the extent that these assumptions change  the ultimate restructuring expenses could vary 
contingencies we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to labor  acquisitions and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters  any of which may result in higher net loss 
taxes we determine our provision for income taxes using the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets 
the ultimate realization of our net deferred tax assets will require profitability 
we have assessed the future profit plans and tax 
table of contents planning strategies together with the years of expiration of carryforward benefits  and have concluded that the deferred tax assets will be not be currently realized and have recorded a valuation allowance against the entire amount of the deferred tax assets 
should our operating performance improve future assessments could conclude that a reduction to the valuation allowance will be needed to reflect deferred tax assets 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
however  we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit 
impact of recently issued accounting standards on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in statement however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt sfas r on july  a component of sfas r includes one of the following options a modified prospective method  b the modified retrospective method  restating all prior periods or c the modified retrospective method  restating only the prior interim periods of a determination as to which of the three options we will adopt will be made at a later date 
as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation expense for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  we have not recognized any operating cash flows for such excess tax deductions in any of the periods presented 

table of contents risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business could be harmed 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business we have a history of losses and may continue to incur losses in the future it is difficult to predict our future operating results 
we began shipping products commercially in june  and we have been shipping products in volume since the first quarter of as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately billion 
we believe that we will continue to experience challenges in selling our products at a profit and may continue to operate with net losses for the foreseeable future 
in the past few years  we experienced a decrease in revenues compared to and  which was  in large part  due to the erosion of asps of our products due to our transition from a proprietary platform to the docsis standards platform and a drop in cmts sales volume 
although our revenues increased throughout as compared to and compared to  we still incurred losses of million and million  respectively  in the twelve months ended december  and as a result of the operating deficiencies  we have had to use available cash and cash equivalents to supplement the operation of our business 
cash used in operating activities for the twelve months ended december  was million compared to million used in the same period in additionally  we generally have been unable to significantly reduce our short term expenses in order to compensate for unexpected decreases in anticipated revenues or delays in generating anticipated revenues 
for example  we have fixed commitments with some of our suppliers that require us to purchase minimum quantities of their products at a specified price irrespective of whether we can subsequently use such quantities in our products 
further  we have experienced and will likely continue to experience declining asps of our products 
we record an inventory charge to reduce our inventory to the lower of cost or market if asps fall below the cost of these products 
in addition  we have significant operating lease commitments for facilities and equipment that generally cannot be cancelled in the short term without substantial penalties 
our business may be adversely affected by delays in or our failure to  commercialize new products  or reduce the cost of manufacturing our current products 
moreover  given the conditions in the broadband equipment market  the profit potential of our business remains unproven 
we may experience fluctuations in our operating results and face unpredictability in our future revenues our quarterly revenues have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
factors that affect our revenues include  among others  the following variations in the timing of orders and shipments of our products  variations in the size of the orders by our customers and pricing concessions on volume sales  competitive market conditions  unpredictable sales cycles  new product introductions by competitors or by us  delays in our introduction of new products  delays in our introduction of added features to our products  delays in the commercialization of products that are competitive in the marketplace  delays in our receipt of and cancellation of orders forecasted by customers  
table of contents variations in capital spending budgets of cable operators and other broadband service providers  international conflicts  including the continuing conflict in iraq  and acts of terrorism and the impact of adverse economic  market and political conditions worldwide  and ability of our products to be qualified or certified as meeting industry standards 
our quarterly results are affected by the gross margin we achieve for the quarter relative to our gross revenues 
a variety of factors influence our gross margin for a particular quarter  including  among others  the following the sales mix of our products  the volume of products manufactured  the type of distribution channel through which we sell our products  the asps of our products  the ability to manage excess and obsolete inventory  delays in reducing the cost of our products  the costs of manufacturing our products  and the effectiveness of our cost reduction measures 
we often recognize a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month of the quarter 
we establish our expenditure levels for product development and other operating expenses based on projected sales levels  and expenses are relatively fixed  particularly in the short term 
for example  a significant percentage of these operating expenses are fixed due to operating leases for our facilities and equipment 
also  we have fixed commitments with some of our suppliers that require us to purchase minimum quantities of their products at a specified price 
because in the past  we have been unable to use all of the products that we purchased from our suppliers  we have taken vendor cancellation charges as a result of these fixed commitments  and we may have to take additional charges in the future if we are unable to use all of the products that we purchase from our suppliers 
as of december   million of purchase obligations were outstanding 
accordingly  variations in timing of sales can cause significant fluctuations in operating results 
in addition  because a significant portion of our business is derived from orders placed by a limited number of large customers  the timing of such orders can also cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 
our expenses for any given quarter are typically based on expected sales and if sales are below expectations  our operating results may be adversely impacted by our inability to adjust spending to compensate for the shortfall 
moreover  our research and development expenses fluctuate in response to new product development  and changing industry requirements and customer demands 
additionally  the unit asps of our products declined considerably in   and  and we anticipate that unit asps of our products will continue to decline in the future 
this has caused and will continue to cause a decrease in our gross margins if we are unable to offset the decline in asps with cost reduction measures 
in addition  the gross margins we realize from the sale of our products are affected by the mix of product sales between higher margin  lower volume head end equipment  such as our dvs products and applications  and lower margin  higher volume has products  such as modems 
we are attempting to increase our gross margin by shifting our product mix from has revenues to higher margin dvs product and application revenues and ceasing investment in our cmts product line 
however  there are no assurances that we will succeed 
for  we expect that sales of our low margin has products will continue to make up a significant portion of our revenues 
moreover  we are in the early stages of development with respect to our dvs product line 
historically  dvs product revenues represented less than of our total revenues 
if our dvs product line does not receive broader market acceptance and we do not generate a greater percentage of total revenues from dvs product revenues  we will not succeed in greatly improving our gross margin 

table of contents we are dependent on a small number of customers and resellers and our business could be harmed by the loss of any of these customers or reductions in their purchasing volumes our customers have undergone and continue to undergo significant consolidation in both north america and internationally  as a limited number of cable operators control an increasing number of systems 
for example  the top nine cable operators in the united states operate systems that service approximately of homes that receive cable services in the united states 
as a result of the consolidation among cable operators  our revenue has been and will continue to be dependent on sales to the few leading cable operators worldwide 
two customers  adelphia and comcast  and  respectively  accounted for or more of total revenues  for the twelve months ended december  adelphia is not expected to be a customer in due to our decision to cease investment in our cmts product line and this may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations in three customers  adelphia  cross beam networks and comcast   and  respectively  accounted for or more of total revenues  for the twelve months ended december  as is common in our industry  we typically do not enter into contracts with our customers in which they commit to purchase products from us 
typically  our sales are made on a purchase order or system contract basis  and none of our customers has entered into a long term agreement requiring it to purchase our products 
moreover  we do not typically require our customers to purchase a minimum quantity of our products  and our customers can generally cancel or significantly reduce their orders on short notice without significant penalties 
the loss of any of our customers can have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
further  any reduction in orders from a given customer can likewise have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
significant sales of our dvs products are made to a small number of resellers  who often incorporate our dvs products and applications in systems that are sold to an end user customer  which is typically a cable operator  satellite provider or broadcast operator 
if one or more of these resellers develop their own products or elect to purchase similar products from another vendor  such an action may have a significant impact on our revenue and results of operations 
also  we may not succeed in attracting new customers as many of our potential customers have pre existing relationships with our current or potential competitors and the continued consolidation of the cable industry reduces the number of potential customers 
to attract new customers  we may be faced with intense price competition  which may affect our gross margins 
we may also lose existing customers or experience declining business from our existing customers because of our decision to cease investment in our cmts product line 
for example  adelphia  one of our largest cmts customers  indicated that it will no longer purchase cmts products from us and may no longer purchase has or dvs products from us 
the loss of adelphia and the loss of any additional cmts customers may be material and could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations  especially if we are unable to offset such losses with increased revenue from our dvs and has products 
recent changes in senior management and the reductions in workforce associated with our restructuring efforts could disrupt the operation of our business  distract our management from focusing on revenue generating efforts  result in the erosion of employee morale  and impair our ability to respond rapidly to growth opportunities in the future we have experienced a number of recent changes in senior management and other key personnel 
our chief executive officer  president and chief technology officer  chief operating officer  chief financial officer and general counsel all resigned within the latter half of our new chief executive officer was appointed in september and our new chief financial officer was appointed in late november we also have recently experienced increased turnover in our video engineering group and finance organization 
the recruitment and retention of a new senior management staff and turnover in key personnel has created and could continue to create a number of transitional challenges for us 
these transitional issues have caused  and may cause  disruptions to our business 
we cannot be assured that a smooth transition of our senior management staff has occurred or that we have taken the necessary steps to affect an orderly continuation of our operations during the transitional period 
further  the process of locating personnel with the combination 
table of contents of skills and attributes required to carry out our goals and integrating such personnel once they are recruited is often lengthy 
we cannot be assured that the integration of our new senior management staff will occur in a timely manner  or that such integration will not present additional transitional challenges for us or adversely affect the operation of our business 
moreover  we have implemented a number of restructuring plans since  including the most recent restructuring activities in which have resulted in personnel reduction of 
the employee reductions and changes in connection with our restructuring activities  as well as future changes in senior management and key personnel  could result in an erosion of morale  and affect the focus and productivity of our remaining employees  including those directly responsible for revenue generation and the management and administration of our finances  which in turn may affect our revenue in the future or cause other administrative deficiencies 
additionally  employees directly affected by the reductions may seek future employment with our business partners  customers or competitors 
although all employees are required to sign a proprietary information agreement with us at the time of hire  there can be no assurances that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 
additionally  we may face wrongful termination  discrimination  or other claims from employees affected by the reduction related to their employment and termination 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or our employees against such claims  regardless of the merits of such actions 
furthermore  such matters could divert the attention of our employees  including management  away from our operations  harm productivity  harm our reputation and increase our expenses 
we cannot assure you that our restructuring efforts will be successful  and we may need to take additional restructuring efforts  including additional personnel reduction  in the future 
we are dependent on key personnel due to the specialized nature of our business  we are highly dependent on the continued service of  and on our ability to attract and retain qualified senior management  engineering  sales and marketing personnel 
the competition for some of these personnel is intense  particularly for engineers with mpeg experience 
the loss of any of these individuals or our inability to recruit such individuals may significantly disrupt and be harmful to our business 
in addition  if we are unable to hire qualified personnel as needed in a timely manner  we may be unable to adequately manage and grow our business 
highly skilled employees with the education and training that we require  especially employees with significant experience and expertise in video  data networking and radio frequency design  are in high demand 
we may incur additional expenses to attract and retain key personnel 
we cannot be assured that the additional expenses we may incur will enable us to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business 
we do not have key person insurance coverage for the loss of any of our employees 
any officer or employee can terminate his or her relationship with us at any time 
our employees generally are not bound by non competition agreements 
there are many risks associated with our participation in industry standards in connection with the development of the docsis specification by cablelabs  a cable industry consortium that establishes cable technology standards and administers compliance testing  we entered into an agreement with cablelabs whereby we licensed to cablelabs on a royalty free basis any of our intellectual property rights  including rights to our proprietary s cdma technology  to the extent that such rights may be asserted against a party desiring to design  manufacture or sell docsis based products  including docsis based products 
this license agreement grants to cablelabs the right to sublicense our intellectual property  including our intellectual property rights in our s cdma patents  to manufacturers that compete with us in the marketplace for docsis based products 
as a result of this license to cablelabs  our competitors that produce docsis based products have access to our technology without having to pay us any royalties or other compensation for the use of our technology 
as a result of our contribution of technology to the docsis intellectual property pool  we may have foregone significant revenue from the potential licensing of our proprietary technology  and we may be unable to recoup the investment in the research and development of intellectual property contributed to the docsis technology pool 

table of contents additionally  the agreement that we signed with cablelabs to participate in the docsis intellectual property pool may make it difficult for us to enforce our intellectual property rights against other companies 
certain cable equipment vendors manufacture and sell docsis based and docsis certified and qualified products without sublicensing from cablelabs the technology in the cablelabs intellectual property pool 
due to the interests of cable operators in having as many equipment vendors as possible  we may feel constrained by competitive pressures from pursuing the enforcement of our intellectual property rights against our competitors that have not entered into sublicenses with cablelabs 
moreover  if we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights against other equipment manufacturers that access technology from the cablelabs intellectual property pool  our license to the technology in the pool may be jeopardized 
certain contributors of technology to the cablelabs intellectual property pool are our competitors and may elect to revoke our license to their technology if we attempt to enforce our intellectual property rights against them 
we may have lost any competitive advantage that our proprietary s cdma technology may have provided us in the marketplace by licensing it to cablelabs  and we may face increased competition because our competitors have the ability to incorporate our technology into their products 
we believe that this increased competition could come from existing competitors or from new competitors who enter the market and that such competition is likely to result in lower product asps  which could harm our revenues and gross margins 
additionally  because our competitors will be able to incorporate our technology into their products  our current customers may choose alternate suppliers or choose to purchase docsis compliant products from multiple suppliers 
we may be unable to effectively compete with the other vendors if we cannot produce docsis compliant cable products more quickly or at lower cost than our competitors 
docsis specifications have not yet been accepted in asia  although an increasing number of asian cable operators are requiring product to be docsis qualified or certified 
a related specification for cable products  called the euro docsis specification  has been formalized by tcomlabs  a cable technology consortium of european cable operators  and european and some asian cable operators have embraced it 
we have contributed certain of our technologies  including our proprietary s cdma technology  to the euro docsis specification 
we may develop and sell products that comply with the euro docsis specification  and we may be unsuccessful in these efforts 
even if we are successful in our efforts  we may face some of the same risks associated with our contribution of intellectual property to the cablelabs docsis intellectual property pool 
we need to certify and qualify our new and existing products to meet industry specifications in order to remain competitive major cable operators worldwide have endorsed the docsis  euro docsis and packetcable specifications and rarely purchase data and voice equipment that is not certified or qualified as compliant with these specifications 
although there is currently no specification for dvs products  if such a specification is adopted  then we will not only need to certify our video products in addition to the current requirement that we certify our has products 
traditionally  cable operators have chosen to purchase only products meeting industry specifications because the specifications enable interoperability among products from multiple vendors  which leads to increased competition among equipment manufacturers and consequently lowers product asps 
consequently  our future success depends on our ability to compete effectively in this marketplace by developing  marketing and selling products that are certified and qualified to industry standards in a timely fashion and in a cost effective manner 
the docsis and packetcable specifications are promulgated by cablelabs 
currently these specifications have been widely adopted by cable operators in north america and by some cable operators in asia  latin america and europe 
the euro docsis specifications have been developed by tcomlabs specifically to meet the requirements of european operators  and have found some acceptance in china as well 
there is no guarantee that our products will continue to be docsis  eurodocsis or packetcable certified or qualified  or will be certified for any new standards that may emerge 
if we are unable to certify or qualify our products as compliant with docsis  eurodocsis or packetcable or other applicable standards in a timely manner  we may be unable to sell our products and may lose some or all of any advantage we might otherwise have had  and our future operating results may be adversely affected 

table of contents although we sell certified and qualified data and voice products  there have been and may continue to be instances where our existing customers and potential new customers elect to purchase products from one or more of our competitors rather than from us 
in response to this situation  we have reduced our prices and continue to experience customer demand to further reduce our prices in order to promote sales of our current products 
this has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our revenues  operating results and gross margin 
developing products to meet these various industry specifications has several risks 
the first is the cost and effort to engineer standards based products and to then prepare them for compliance testing 
not only do we have to certify or qualify new products  but any of our currently certified or qualified products must be re certified or re qualified should they be changed in any way 
second  there is no guarantee that these products will be certified or qualified as meeting these specifications in a timely fashion  if ever 
because most cable operators purchase only those products that have been certified or qualified as meeting these specifications  it is highly unlikely that we will be able to sell our products until they achieve certification or qualification  which can be a lengthy process 
as a result  we may incur significant research and development expenses to develop new products that may not receive certification or qualification and we cannot recoup the costs of these research and development expenses by marketing uncertified or unqualified products 
moreover  a consequence of cable operators only purchasing products certified or qualified as meeting industry specifications is the increased competition between equipment vendors  which has resulted in a steady and ongoing decline in equipment prices as vendors compete for cable operators business 
third  there is no guarantee that we will be able to support all future cable industry specifications  which will likely have an adverse impact on our future revenues 
our video products and applications must achieve widespread market acceptance to advance the growth of our digital video solutions business our success will depend upon the widespread acceptance of our video products and applications by broadband providers 
traditionally  we have had success selling our cherrypicker and dm products to cable operators and satellite providers  however  there is no guarantee that this success will continue as the products and applications evolve and as new competitors enter the market 
in  we introduced our bp  which is our product geared towards television broadcasters 
currently  we have had one large deployment of bp and have had limited sales of the bp through resale channels 
we are currently developing technology for the deployment of video for the telecom carriers  however  there is no guarantee that we will continue to pursue the development  that our product will work or that our product will find widespread acceptance among the telecom carriers 
the emerging market trend to standardize the digital video technology may challenge our ability to continue to grow our digital video business comcast  time warner and cox  the three largest cable operators in the us  started their ngna initiative in to develop a common approach to transform their cable systems into all digital networks 
this initiative could potentially impact video technology  including our video technology and products 
working as a group the operators can work more effectively with equipment vendors in defining the products and product capabilities required for the migration 
in the participating operators commissioned cablelabs to manage the ngna initiative and to develop a set of standards to which equipment vendors can build their products 
the ngna initiative is so far following the model successfully proven with the earlier docsis initiative  which enabled the development of interoperable cable modems  cmtss and other associated equipment that allowed us operators to rollout broadband cable modem service much faster  more broadly and with greater success than telecom carriers could offer their competing dsl service 
as it has with data services  cablelabs may request or even require companies to contribute their video technologies to a docsis like technology pool on a royalty free basis 
if we contribute any of our video technology to a docsis like technology pool  our video technology is subject to the same risks as those associated with the standards based technology for our data services  which are discussed above 
subject to the success of the initiative  cable operators would want to purchase only video products that have been 
table of contents certified or qualified by cablelabs  in which case we will not be able to sell our video products until they achieve certification or qualification  which  based on our experience with our data services  can be a lengthy process 
as a result  we may incur significant research and development expenses to develop new video products that may not receive certification or qualification and we may not be able to recoup the costs of these research and development expenses by marketing uncertified or unqualified products 
moreover  there is no guarantee that we will be able to support all future cable industry specifications relating to video products  which would likely have an adverse impact on our future revenues 
furthermore  a consequence of cable operators purchasing only certified or qualified products  based on our experience with the data services  is the increased competition between equipment vendors  which would result in a steady and ongoing decline in equipment prices as vendors compete for cable operators business 
consequently  our future success may depend on our ability to compete effectively in the video marketplace by developing  marketing and selling products that are certified and qualified to industry standards in a timely fashion and in a cost effective manner 
we depend on broadband providers capital spending for a substantial portion of our revenue and any decrease or delay in capital spending would negatively impact our operating results and financial condition historically  almost all of our sales had been derived from sales to broadband providers and  more specifically  cable operators  and we expect these sales to constitute a significant portion of net sales for the foreseeable future 
demand for our products will depend on the magnitude and timing of capital spending by broadband providers 
these capital spending patterns are dependent on a variety of factors including the availability of financing  annual budget cycles  as well as the typical reduction in upgrade projects during the winter months  the status of federal  local and foreign government regulation and deregulation of the telecommunications industry  overall demand for broadband services and the acceptance of new data  video and voice services  evolving industry standards and network architectures  competitive pressures including the availability of alternative data transmission and access technologies  discretionary consumer spending patterns  and general economic conditions 
average selling prices of broadband equipment may continue to decline  decreasing our gross margins the broadband equipment market has been characterized by erosion of product asps  particularly for has devices 
this erosion may continue 
the asps for our products are likely to continue to decline due to competitive pricing pressures  promotional programs and customers possessing strong negotiating positions which require price reductions as a condition of purchase 
in addition  we believe that the widespread adoption of industry specifications  such as the docsis and eurodocsis specifications  is further eroding asps as cable modems and other similar has products become commodity products 
if a specification is adopted for video technology  our dvs products may experience the same asp erosion 
decreasing asps could result in decreased revenues even if the number of units sold increases 
decreasing asps may also require us to sell our products at much lower gross margin than in the past  and in fact  we may sell products at a loss 
the primary reason that our gross profits have generally declined in recent years is the decline in product asps 
as a result  we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future revenue  gross margin and operating results due to asp erosion 
therefore  we must continue to develop and introduce on a timely basis and a cost effective manner new products or next generation products with enhanced functionalities that can be sold at higher gross margins 
if we fail to do so our revenues and gross margins may decline further 

table of contents we must achieve cost reductions or increase revenues to attain profitability in prior years  we experienced revenue declines  which were  in large part  due to declining product asps due to our transition from a proprietary platform to the docsis standards platform 
most recently  we have experienced a decrease in revenue derived from our docsis cmts sales 
this has resulted in increased losses and made it difficult for us to attain profitability 
in order to achieve profitability  we must significantly increase our revenues  reduce the cost of our products  and maintain or reduce our operating expenses 
although we have implemented expense reduction and restructuring plans in the past  including the latest restructurings in the fourth quarter of  that have focused on cost reductions and operating efficiencies  we still operate at a loss 
a large portion of our expenses  including rent  and operating lease expenditures  is fixed and difficult to reduce or change 
accordingly  if our revenue does not meet our expectations  we may not be able to adjust our expenses quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall in revenue 
in that event  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
as product asps decline  we need to reduce the cost of our products through design and engineering changes 
we may not be successful in redesigning our products  and  even if we are successful  our efforts may be delayed or our redesigned products may contain significant errors and product defects 
in addition  any redesign may not result in sufficient cost reductions to allow us to reduce significantly the prices of our products or improve our gross margins 
reductions in our product costs may require us to use lower priced components that are highly integrated in future products and may require us to enter into high volume or long term purchase or manufacturing agreements 
volume purchase or manufacturing agreements may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  and we could incur significant expenses without related revenues if we cannot use the products or services offered by such agreements 
we have incurred significant vendor cancellation charges related to volume purchase and manufacturing agreements in the past and may incur such charges in the future 
we may not be able to raise additional funds to continue operating our business our main source of liquidity continues to be our unrestricted cash on hand 
as a result of our history of operating losses  we expect to continue to use our unrestricted cash to fund operating losses in the future 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased to million at december   from million at december  if our operating losses are more severe than expected or continue longer than expected  we may find it necessary to seek other sources of financing to support our capital needs and provide available funds for working capital 
furthermore  as of december   we had million of notes outstanding that mature in august and may need to seek additional financing to repay the notes at maturity 
given the current condition of the capital markets  there are few sources of financing available to us 
commercial bank financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms 
accordingly  any plan to raise additional capital  if available to us  would likely involve an equity based or equity linked financing  such as the issuance of convertible debt  common stock or preferred stock  which would be dilutive to our stockholders 
if we are unable to procure additional working capital  as necessary  we may be unable to continue operations 
on october   we filed a registration statement on form s with the sec 
this shelf registration statement  which was declared effective by the sec on november   will allow us to issue various types of securities  including common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and warrants to purchase common stock  from time to time up to an aggregate of million  subject to market conditions and our capital needs 
we may dispose of or discontinue existing product lines  which may adversely impact our future results on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our various product offerings in order to determine whether any should be discontinued or  to the extent possible  divested 
moreover  the worldwide downturn in the telecommunications industry led us to reassess our business strategy  which in turn caused us to discontinue investment in 
table of contents certain product lines 
we have ceased investment in the telecom and satellite businesses and largely sold or discontinued the various businesses we acquired in and in october  we also announced our determination to cease investment in the cmts product line and halt development of future cmts hardware 
in february  we agreed to sell to ati technologies inc certain of our cable modem semiconductor assets 
we cannot be assured that we have correctly forecasted  or will correctly forecast in the future  the right product lines to dispose or discontinue or that our decision to dispose of or discontinue various investments and product lines is prudent if market conditions change 
in addition  we cannot be assured that the discontinuance of various product lines will reduce our operating expenses or will not cause us to incur material charges associated with such decision 
furthermore  the discontinuance of existing product lines entails various risks  including the risks that we will not be able to find a buyer for a product line or the purchase price obtained will not be equal to the book value of the assets for the product line 
other risks include managing the expectations of  and maintaining good relations with  our customers who previously purchased disposed or discontinued product lines  which could prevent us from selling other products to them in the future 
we may also incur other liabilities and costs associated with our disposal or discontinuance of product lines 
we may be unable to provide adequate customer support our ability to achieve our planned sales growth and retain current and future customers will depend in part upon the quality of our customer support operations 
our customers generally require significant support and training with respect to our products  particularly in the initial deployment and implementation stages 
spikes in demand of our support services may cause us to be unable to serve our customers 
we may not have adequate personnel to provide the levels of support that our customers may require during initial product deployment or on an ongoing basis especially during peak periods 
our inability to provide sufficient support to our customers could delay or prevent the successful deployment of our products 
in addition  our failure to provide adequate support could harm our reputation and relationships with our customers and could prevent us from selling product to existing customers or gaining new customers 
furthermore  we may experience transitional issues relating to customer support in connection with our decision to dispose of or discontinue various investments and product lines 
we may incur liability associated with customers dissatisfaction with the level of customer support maintained for discontinued product lines 
for example  in january  adelphia sued us in colorado state court  alleging  among other things  breach of contract and misrepresentation in connection with our sale of cmts cable modem termination system products to adelphia and our announcement to cease future investment in the cmts market 
we may have financial exposure to litigation we and or our directors and officers are defendants in a number of lawsuits  including securities litigation lawsuits and the lawsuit with adelphia discussed above see item legal proceedings for more information regarding our litigation 
as a result  we may have financial exposure to litigation as a defendant and because we are obligated to indemnify our officers and members of our board of directors for certain actions taken by our officers and directors on our behalf 
in order to limit financial exposure arising from litigation and or our obligation to indemnify our officers and directors  we have historically purchased directors and officers insurance d o insurance 
however  the availability of d o insurance may become more difficult and more costly for companies to attain 
in recent years  we have experienced a significant increase in the cost of our d o insurance 
there can be no assurance that d o insurance will be available to us in the future or  if d o insurance is available  it may be prohibitively expensive 
additionally  some insurance underwriters who offered d o insurance in the past have been placed into liquidation or may be  at some future point  placed into liquidation 
if there is no insurance coverage for the litigation or  even if there is insurance coverage  if a carrier is subsequently liquidated or placed into liquidation  we will be responsible for the attorney fees and costs resulting from the litigation 
the incurrence of significant fees and expenses in connection with the litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents the sales cycle for certain of our products is lengthy  which makes forecasting of our customer orders and revenues difficult the sales cycle for certain of our products is lengthy  often lasting nine months to more than a year 
our customers generally conduct significant technical evaluations  including customer trials  of our products as well as competing products prior to making a purchasing decision 
in addition  purchasing decisions may also be delayed because of a customer s internal budget approval processes 
because of the lengthy sales cycle and the size of customer orders  if orders forecasted for a specific customer for a particular period do not occur in that period  our revenues and operating results for that particular quarter could suffer 
moreover  a portion of our expenses related to an anticipated order is fixed and difficult to reduce or change  which may further impact our revenues and operating results for a particular period 
we need to develop additional distribution channels to market and sell our products the vast majority of our data and voice product sales have traditionally been to large cable operators 
our dvs products have been traditionally sold to large cable operators and satellite operators with recent  limited sales to television broadcasters 
we have not had access to smaller broadband providers 
although we intend to establish strategic relationships with leading distributors worldwide to new customers  we may not succeed in establishing these relationships 
even if we do establish these relationships  the distributors may not succeed in marketing our products to their customers 
some of our competitors have established long standing relationships with these cable operators that may limit our and our distributors ability to sell our products to those customers 
even if we were to sell our products to those customers  it would likely not be based on long term commitments  and those customers would be able to terminate their relationships with us at any time without significant penalties 
we may fail to accurately forecast customer demand for our products the nature of the broadband industry makes it difficult for us to accurately forecast demand for our products 
our inability to forecast accurately the actual demand for our products may result in too much or too little supply of products or an over under capacity of manufacturing or testing resources at any given point in time 
the existence of any one or more of these situations could have a negative impact on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we have incurred significant vendor cancellation charges related to volume purchase and manufacturing agreements in the past and may incur such charges in the future 
we had purchase obligations of approximately million as of december   primarily to purchase minimum quantities of materials and components used to manufacture our products 
we may be obligated to fulfill these purchase obligations even if demand for our products is lower than we anticipate 
we may not be able to manage expenses and inventory risks associated with meeting the demand of our customers from time to time  we receive indications from our customers as to their future plans and requirements to ensure that we will be prepared to meet their demand for our products 
if actual orders differ materially from these indications  our ability to manage inventory and expenses may be affected 
in addition  if we fail to meet customers supply expectations  we may lose business from such customers 
if we enter into purchase commitments to acquire materials  or expend resources to manufacture products and such products are not purchased by our customers  our business and operating results could suffer 
we are dependent on key third party suppliers and any failure by them to deliver components could limit our ability to satisfy customer demand we manufacture all of our products using components or subassemblies procured from third party suppliers  including semiconductors 
some of these components are available from a sole source and others are available from limited sources 
a majority of our sales are from products containing one or more components that are available only from sole source suppliers 
for example  our video equipment is single sourced from a manufacturer in san jose  california 
our modems are sourced from a manufacturer in china 
additionally  
table of contents some of our components are custom parts that are produced to our specifications  and it may be difficult to move the manufacturing of such components from one vendor to another vendor 
any interruption in the operations of our vendors of sole source or custom product parts could adversely affect our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to customers 
if we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of components  including semiconductors  from our current sources  we could experience difficulties in obtaining alternative sources or in altering product designs to use alternative components 
resulting delays or reductions in product shipments could damage customer relationships and expose us to potential damages that may arise from our inability to supply our customers with products 
further  a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components  such as our semiconductor components  could harm our gross margin or operating results 
additionally  we attempt to limit this risk by maintaining safety stocks of these components  subassemblies and modules 
as a result of this investment in inventories  we have in the past and in the future may be subject to risk of excess and obsolete inventories  which could harm our business 
in this regard  our gross margins and operating results could be adversely affected by excess and obsolete inventory 
we may be unable to migrate to new semiconductor process technologies successfully or on a timely basis our future success will depend in part upon our ability to develop products that utilize new semiconductor process technologies 
these technologies change rapidly and require us to spend significant amounts on research and development 
we continuously evaluate the benefits of redesigning our integrated circuits using smaller geometry process technologies to improve performance and reduce costs 
the transition of our products to integrated circuits with increasingly smaller geometries will be important to our competitive position 
other companies have experienced difficulty in migrating to new semiconductor processes and  consequently  have suffered reduced yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expense levels 
moreover  we depend on our relationship with our third party manufacturers to migrate to smaller geometry processes successfully 
our ability to directly control product delivery schedules and product quality is dependent on third party contract manufacturers most of our products are assembled and tested by contract manufacturers using testing equipment that we provide 
as a result of our dependence on these contract manufacturers for the assembly and testing of our products  we do not directly control product delivery schedules or product quality 
any product shortages or quality assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacturing  assembling or testing our products 
in addition  as manufacturing volume increases  we will need to procure and assemble additional testing equipment and provide it to our contract manufacturers 
the production and assembly of testing equipment typically requires significant lead times 
we could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are unable to provide this testing equipment to our contract manufacturers in a timely manner 
we are dependent upon international sales and there are many risks associated with international operations we expect sales to customers outside of the united states to continue to represent a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
for the year ended december   and approximately  and  respectively  of our net revenues were from customers outside of the us international sales are subject to a number of risks  including the following changes in foreign government regulations and communications standards  import and export license requirements  tariffs and taxes  trade barriers  difficulty in protecting intellectual property  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  currency fluctuations  
table of contents the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  treaties and technical standards  difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  and political and economic instability 
if our customers are affected by currency devaluations or general economic downturns their ability to purchase our products could be reduced significantly 
payment cycles for international customers typically are longer than those for customers in north america 
our international operations are subject to certain risks common to foreign operations in general  such as governmental regulations and import restrictions 
in addition  there are social  political  labor and economic conditions in specific countries or regions as well as difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  and potential adverse foreign tax consequences  among other factors that could also have an impact on our business and results of operations outside of the united states 
furthermore  foreign countries may decide to prohibit  terminate or delay the construction of new broadband infrastructures for a variety of reasons 
these reasons include environmental issues  economic downturns and availability of favorable pricing for other communications services or the availability and cost of related equipment 
any such action by foreign countries would reduce the market for our products 
like other companies operating or selling internationally  we are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other laws which prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by us and other business entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
we make sales in countries known to experience corruption 
our sales activities in such countries create the risk of an unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees  consultants  sales agents or distributors which could be in violation of various laws including the fcpa  even though such parties are not always subject to our control 
we have attempted to implement safeguards to prevent losses from such practices and to discourage such practices by our employees  consultants  sales agents and distributors 
however  our safeguards may prove to be less than effective and our employees  consultants  sales agents or distributors may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible 
violations of the fcpa may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions  and we may be subject to other liabilities  which could negatively affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
exchange rate fluctuations could cause a decline in our financial condition and results of operations while we generally invoice our foreign sales in us dollars  we invoice some of our sales in europe in euros and other sales in the united kingdom  belgium  canada  japan  hong kong  korea and china in local currencies 
since we have also elected to take payment from our customers in local currencies and may elect to take payment in other foreign currencies in the future  we are exposed to losses as the result of foreign currency fluctuations 
we currently do not engage in foreign currency hedging transactions 
we may in the future choose to limit our exposure by the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts or through similar hedging strategies 
no currency hedging strategy can fully protect against exchange related losses 
in addition  if the relative value of the us dollar in comparison to the currency of our foreign customers should increase  the resulting effective price increase of our products to those foreign customers could result in decreased sales 
furthermore  foreign countries may decide to prohibit  terminate or delay the construction of new broadband infrastructures for a variety of reasons 
these reasons include environmental issues  economic downturns and availability of favorable pricing for other communications services or the availability and cost of related equipment 
any such action by foreign countries would reduce the market for our products 
the deployment process for our equipment may be lengthy and may delay the receipt of new orders and cause fluctuations in our revenues the timing of deployment of our equipment can be subject to a number of other risks  including the availability of skilled engineering and technical personnel  the availability of other equipment such as fiber optic cable  and the need for local zoning and licensing approvals 
we believe that changes in our customers 
table of contents deployment plans have delayed  and may in the future delay the receipt of new orders 
since the majority of our sales have been to relatively few customers  a delay in equipment deployment with any one customer has in the past had  and could in the future  have a material adverse effect on our sales for a particular quarter 
our industry is highly competitive with many larger and more established competitors the market for our products is extremely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change 
our direct competitors include ambit microsystems corporation  cisco systems  bigband networks  motorola  scientific atlanta and toshiba 
additionally  we face competition from early stage companies with access to significant financial backing that improve existing technologies or develop new technologies 
the principal competitive factors in our market include the following product performance  features and reliability  price  size and stability of operations  breadth of product line  sales and distribution capabilities  technical support and service  relationships with providers of service providers  and compliance with industry standards 
some of these factors are outside of our control 
conditions in the market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements 
the development and market acceptance of alternative technologies could decrease the demand for our products or render them obsolete 
our competitors may introduce products that are less costly  provide superior performance or achieve greater market acceptance than our products 
many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution  customer support and other resources  as well as better name recognition and access to customers than we do 
the widespread adoption of docsis and other industry standards has and is likely to continue to cause increased price competition 
we believe that the adoption of these standards have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in lower asps for our products 
any increased price competition or reduction in sales of our products  particularly our higher margin head end products  has resulted and will continue to result in decreased revenue and downward pressure on our gross margin 
these competitive pressures have and are likely to continue to have an adverse impact on our business 
our business is subject to the risks of warranty returns  product liability and product defects products like ours are very complex and can frequently contain undetected errors or failures  especially when first introduced or when new versions are released 
despite testing  errors may occur 
product errors could affect the performance or interoperability of our products  delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products  adversely affect our reputation and our customers willingness to buy products from us and adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products 
any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share  increase our service costs  cause us to incur substantial costs in redesigning the products  subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks  any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
although we have limitation of liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale  they may not be effective as a result of federal  state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions in the united states or other countries 
the sale and support of our products also entails the risk of product liability claims 
we maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our products  but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any claim asserted against us 
in addition  even claims that 
table of contents ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation and divert management s time and other resources 
we may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products 
even though we seek to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products  there are risks 
we cannot be assured that any patent  trademark  copyright or other intellectual property rights owned by us will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged  that such intellectual property rights will provide competitive advantages to us or that any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us  if at all 
we cannot be assured that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology  duplicate our technology or design around the patents that we own 
in addition  effective patent  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries in which we do business or may do business in the future 
our pending patent applications may not be granted 
even if they are granted  the claims covered by any patent may be reduced from those included in our applications 
any patent might be subject to challenge in court and  whether or not challenged  might not be broad enough to prevent third parties from developing equivalent technologies or products without a license from us 
we believe that the future success of our business will depend on our ability to translate the technological expertise and innovation of our employees into new and enhanced products 
we have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees  and we enter into non disclosure agreements with many of our suppliers  distributors and appropriate customers so as to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information 
these contractual arrangements  as well as statutory protections  may not prove sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our trade secrets or technology or deter independent third party development of similar technologies 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
we may  in the future  take legal action to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our business  operating results  financial position and liquidity 
cablelabs docsis specification includes two advanced physical layer technologies  s cdma and a tdma 
in connection with the development of the docsis specification by cablelabs  we entered into an agreement with cablelabs  on a royalty free basis  whereby we licensed to cablelabs many of our intellectual property rights to the extent that such rights may be asserted against a party desiring to design  manufacture or sell docsis based products  including docsis based products 
this license agreement grants to cablelabs the right to sublicense our intellectual property  including our intellectual property rights in our s cdma patents  to manufacturers that compete with us in the marketplace for docsis based products 
we pursue the registration of our trademarks in the united states and have applications pending to register several of our trademarks throughout the world 
however  the laws of certain foreign countries might not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
effective trademark  copyright  trade secret and patent protection may not be available in every country in which our products may be manufactured  marketed or sold 
third party claims of infringement or other claims against us could adversely affect our ability to market our products  require us to redesign our products or seek licenses from third parties  and seriously harm our operating results and disrupt our business as is typical in the industry in which we operate  we have been and may from time to time be notified of claims that we may be infringing intellectual property rights owned by third parties 
we also have in the past agreed to  and may from time to time in the future agree to  indemnify a customer of our technology or 
table of contents products for claims against the customer by a third party based on claims that our technology or products infringe patents of that third party 
we further believe that companies may be increasingly subject to infringement claims as distressed companies and individuals attempt to generate cash by enforcing their patent portfolio against a wide range of products 
these types of claims  meritorious or not  can result in costly and time consuming litigation  divert management s attention and other resources  require us to enter into royalty arrangements  subject us to damages or injunctions restricting the sale of our products  require us to indemnify our customers for the use of the allegedly infringing products  require us to refund payment of allegedly infringing products to our customers or to forgo future payments  require us to redesign certain of our products  or damage our reputation 
our failure to obtain a license for key intellectual property rights from a third party for technology used by us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacturing of products utilizing the technology 
alternatively  we could be required to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology with no assurances that we would be successful in such endeavors 
the occurrence of any of the above events could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition  we may incur substantially more debt as of december   we had approximately million of long term obligations of which million is long term debt associated with our notes 
this level of indebtedness may adversely affect our stockholders by making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness  increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing  requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of  and interest on  our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund our growth strategy  working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less debt 
we may incur substantial additional debt in the future 
the terms of our outstanding debt do not fully prohibit us from doing so 
if new debt is added to our current levels  the related risks described above could intensify 
we need to develop and introduce new and enhanced products in a timely manner to remain competitive the markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and relatively short product life 
the pursuit of necessary technological advances and the development of new products require substantial time and expense 
for example  we made ten acquisitions during the period between and due to various economic conditions  none of the products from our acquired businesses have achieved the level of market acceptance that was forecasted at the time of their acquisitions 
additionally  certain product groups have not achieved the level of technological development needed to be marketable or to expand the market 
as a result  we recorded an aggregate of approximately million related to impairment charges and write down of in process research and development related to the acquired technologies  both of which negatively impacted our operating results in and to compete successfully in the markets in which we operate  we must design  develop  manufacture and sell new or enhanced products that provide increasingly higher levels of performance and reliability 
however  we may not be able to successfully develop or introduce these products  if our products are not cost effective  brought to market in a timely manner  
table of contents in accordance with evolving industry standards and architecture  or fail to achieve market acceptance 
there is no assurance that the technologies we are currently developing or intend to develop will achieve feasibility or that even if we are successful  the developed product will be accepted by the market 
we may not be able to recover the costs of existing and future product developments and our failure to do so may materially and adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets  which could result in material losses most of our sales are on an open credit basis  with payment terms of to days typically in the united states  and because of local customs or conditions  longer in some markets outside the united states 
beyond our open credit arrangements  we have also experienced a request for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements  which we have not provided to date and do not expect to provide in the future 
we expect demand for enhanced open credit terms  for example  longer payment terms  customer financing and leasing arrangements to continue and believe that such arrangements are a competitive factor in obtaining business 
our decision not to provide these types of financing arrangements may adversely affect our ability to sell products  and therefore  our revenue  operations and business 
because of the current condition in the global economy  our exposure to credit risks relating to sales on an open credit basis has increased 
although we monitor and attempt to mitigate the associated risk  there can be no assurance that our efforts will be effective in reducing credit risk 
additionally  there have been significant insolvencies and bankruptcies among our customers  which have and may continue to cause us to incur economic and financial losses 
there can be no assurance that additional losses would not be incurred and that such losses would not be material 
although these losses have generally not been material to date  future losses  if incurred  could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
we have and we may seek to expand our business through acquisitions  acquisitions could disrupt our business operations and harm our operating results in order to expand our business  we may make strategic acquisitions of other companies or certain assets 
we plan to continue to evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions from time to time  and may make an acquisition at some future point 
however  the current volatility in the stock market and the current price of our common stock may adversely affect our ability to make such acquisitions 
any acquisition that we make involves substantial risks  including the following difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies  products and personnel of an acquired company  diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in process research and development  difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners  insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies 
acquisitions may also cause us to issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership  assume liabilities  
table of contents record goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential periodic impairment charges  incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets  incur large and immediate write offs  or become subject to litigation 
for example  we made ten acquisitions during the period between and due to various economic conditions  none of the products from our acquired businesses have achieved the level of market acceptance that was forecasted at the time of their acquisitions 
as a result  we recorded an aggregate of approximately million related to impairment charges and write down of in process research and development related to the acquired technologies  both of which negatively impacted our operating results in and mergers and acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky  and no assurance can be given that our future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions we make could harm our business and operating results in a material way 
even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products  there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that all pre acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products 
our products are subject to safety approvals and certifications in the united states  our products are required to meet certain safety requirements 
for example  we are required to have our products certified by underwriters laboratory in order to meet federal requirements relating to electrical appliances to be used inside the home 
outside the united states  our products are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country in which the products are manufactured or sold 
these requirements are likely to vary widely 
we may be unable to obtain on a timely basis or at all the regulatory approvals that may be required for the manufacture  marketing and sale of our products 
we are vulnerable to earthquakes  disruptions to our power supply  labor issues and other unexpected events our corporate headquarters  as well as the majority of our research and development activities and some manufacturing operations are located in california  an area known for seismic activity 
in addition  the operations of some of our key suppliers and manufacturers are also located in this area and in other areas known for seismic activity  such as taiwan 
an earthquake  or other significant natural disaster  could result in an interruption in our business or the operations of one or more of our key suppliers 
our california operations may also be subject to disruptions in power supply  such as those that occurred in our business may also be impacted by labor issues related to our operations and or those of our suppliers  service providers  or customers 
such an interruption could harm our operating results 
we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate for any losses that we may sustain as a result of any natural disasters or other unexpected events 
various export licensing requirements could materially and adversely affect our business or require us to significantly modify our current business practices various government export regulations may apply to the encryption or other features of our products 
we may have to make certain filings with the government in order to obtain permission to export certain of our products 
in the past  we may have inadvertently failed to file certain export applications and notices  and we may have to make certain filings and request permission to continue exportation of any affected products without interruption while these applications are pending 
if we do have to make such filings  we cannot be assured that we will obtain permission to continue exporting the affected products or that we will obtain any required export approvals now or in the future 
if we do not receive the required export approvals  we may be 
table of contents unable to ship those products to certain customers located outside of the united states 
in addition  we may be subject to fines or other penalties due to the failure to file certain export applications and notices 
compliance with changing laws and regulations relating to corporate governance and public disclosure has resulted  and will continue to result  in the incurrence of additional expenses associated with being a public company new and changing laws and regulations  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq national market rules  impose stricter corporate governance requirements  greater disclosure obligations  and greater focus on disclosure and internal controls 
these new laws and regulations have had the effect of increasing the complexity and cost of our company s corporate governance compliance  diverting the time and attention of our management from revenue generating activities to compliance activities  and increasing the risk of personal liability for our board members and executive officers involved in our company s corporate governance process 
our efforts to comply with evolving laws and regulations have resulted  and will continue to result  in increased general and administrative expenses  and increased professional and independent auditor fees 
in addition  it has become more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance 
in order to meet the new corporate governance and financial disclosure obligations  we have been taking  and will continue to take  steps to improve our controls and procedures  including disclosure and internal controls  and related corporate governance policies and procedures to address compliance issues and correct any deficiencies that we may discover 
for example  pursuant to the requirements of section of sarbanes oxley  we undertook a comprehensive and costly evaluation of our internal controls 
based on this evaluation and as set forth in the section management report included in this annual report  our management determined that our internal controls over financial reporting were ineffective 
our management further determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective 
in response to these deficiencies  our management has commenced the necessary processes and procedures to remediate the deficiencies in our disclosure and internal control by establishing  implementing and testing additional controls 
our efforts to correct the deficiencies in our disclosure and internal controls have required  and will continue to require  the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
in addition  we anticipate the costs associated with the testing and evaluation of our internal controls will be significant and material in fiscal year and may continue to be material in future fiscal years as these controls are maintained and continually evaluated and tested 
furthermore  changes in our operations and the growth of our business may require us to modify and expand our disclosure controls and procedures  internal controls and related corporate governance policies 
in addition  the new and changed laws and regulations are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity  and as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies 
if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws and regulations differ from the conduct intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities or varying interpretations of the law  we could be subject to regulatory sanctions  our reputation may be harmed and our stock price may be adversely affected 
our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
our stock price could be subject to extreme fluctuations in response to a variety of factors  including the following actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new products or services offered by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  conditions or trends in the broadband services industry  
table of contents changes in the economic performance and or market valuations of internet  online service or broadband service industries  our announcement of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  adoption of industry standards and the inclusion or compatibility of our technology with such standards  adverse or unfavorable publicity regarding us or our products  additions or departures of key personnel  sales of common stock  and other events or factors that may be beyond our control 
in addition  the stock markets in general  and the nasdaq national market and the stock price of broadband services and technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume volatility 
this volatility and decline has affected many companies irrespective of or disproportionately to the operating performance of these companies 
additionally  industry factors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
we have adopted a stockholder rights plan  which  together with provisions in our charter documents and delaware law  may delay or prevent an acquisition of us  which could decrease the value of our stock we adopted a stockholder rights plan pursuant to which we distributed one right for each outstanding share of common stock held by stockholders of record as of february  because the rights may substantially dilute the stock ownership of a person or group attempting a take over of us  even if such a change in control is beneficial to our stockholders  without the approval of our board of directors  the plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  or a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock  without first negotiating with our board of directors 
additionally  provisions of our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors  and we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which could also have the effect of delaying or preventing our acquisition by a third party 
newly adopted accounting regulations that require companies to expense stock options will result in a decrease in our earnings and our stock price may decline 
the financial accounting standards board recently adopted the previously proposed regulations that will eliminate the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method that we currently use and generally would require that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
we will be required to expense stock options effective in periods after july  currently  we generally only disclose such expenses on a pro forma basis in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the adoption of this new accounting regulation will have a significant impact on our results of operations and our stock price could decline accordingly 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk
