item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis and set forth elsewhere in this report  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the section titled business factors that may affect future results for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
overview we develop  manufacture and market products for medical applications using embolotherapy techniques 
embolotherapy is the process of obstructing a blood vessel or organ by the insertion or lodgment of particles or other materials 
embolotherapy works by reducing blood flow to targeted areas of the body 
our core technologies consist of patented bio engineered polymers  which are chemical compounds that we create through the application to medical science of engineering principles  and manufacturing methods 
these core technologies are used to produce miniature spherical beads with unique properties for a variety of applications 
typically  a procedure is performed by an interventional radiologist who injects particles through a catheter into the blood vessels that feed these target areas 
by selectively blocking the target tissue s blood supply  the deprived tissue will either become destroyed or devitalized  resulting in therapeutic benefit 
in  we generated revenues primarily from product sales of our embosphere microspheres and embogold microspheres in north america 
we also generate revenues from product sales in the european union and other geographic territories including the middle east  africa  south america  and asia 
product revenues also include the sale of accessory embolotherapy devices such as our embocath catheter and our segway guidewire  as well as our other non embolotherapy products  including barium  a substance used to enhance x rays of the gastrointestinal system and other gastrointestinal medical testing  and other ancillary medical devices sold exclusively in europe 
we currently derive a majority of our revenues in the united states from the sale of embosphere microspheres and embogold microspheres for use in the treatment of uterine fibroids 
we do not have fda clearance to market our embogold microspheres for use in the treatment of uterine fibroids  and we determined in not to seek such approval at this time 
we made this decision because of reports that a small number of the patients treated with ufe using embogold microspheres  which we believe constitute approximately of the total number of patients receiving the procedure  reported a delayed onset of pain and or rash 
our principal focus is on growing our embosphere microsphere and accessory embolotherapy device business worldwide  specifically the ufe procedure  which we believe will be a key driver to our success 
our marketing strategy is to promote ufe through our askufe awareness and education program and also to specifically promote our embosphere microspheres as the treatment of choice for ufe 
our success will depend upon the continued acceptance by the medical community  patients and third party payers of the ufe procedure  and our embosphere microspheres product and other products as safe  medically therapeutic and cost effective 
in the third quarter of we obtained ce mark approval in europe for our hepasphere sap microsphere product for the embolization of liver tumors 
we intend to commence marketing of our hepasphere sap microsphere for this application in in the fourth quarter of  richard j 
faleschini joined us as president and chief executive officer and gary m 
saxton joined us as vice president  marketing and sales 
we recorded a non routine charge of  in the fourth quarter of related to the payment of damages by biosphere medical sa  our wholly owned french subsidiary  in satisfaction of a judgment made in favor of terumo europe nv by the commercial court of pointoise  france in a contract dispute 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed a private placement of million of series a convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock with sepracor inc and affiliates of cerberus capital management  lp  both of which are existing investors of the company 
we have experienced operating losses in each fiscal period since our inception 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
most of our expenditures to date have been for sales and marketing activities  general and administrative expenses and research and development activities 
we expect to experience continued operating losses until at least the fourth quarter of as we execute our business plan  including continuing to establish sales and marketing capabilities and conducting research and development activities 
research and development the following table identifies each of the programs for which we have incurred research and development expenses in the years ended december   and and the current development phase of each

total research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  representing approximately  and of our total costs and expenses for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our research and development functions typically work on a number of projects concurrently 
in addition  except for clinical expenses  a substantial amount of fixed research and development costs such as salary and salary related benefits  rent  equipment depreciation  utilities  insurance and maintenance are shared among various programs 
accordingly  we have not historically tracked specific costs for each of our research and development projects 
there is a risk that any medical device development program may not produce revenue 
moreover  because of uncertainties inherent in medical device development  including those factors described above under business risk factors that may affect results  we may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize the product candidates included in the table above 
as described in the table above  we recently have obtained ce mark approval for our hepasphere sap microspheres  which are also in clinical evaluation in japan 
we have exclusive worldwide rights to the hepasphere sap microspheres technology under a license from dr 
shinichi hori  subject only to dr 
hori s right to conduct clinical trials on our behalf in japan  treat patients at rinku medical center and osaka medical center in japan and engage in research at osaka university 
our temprx microspheres and radiosphere microspheres product development initiatives are in preclinical and feasibility evaluation 
the successful development of these early stage product candidates is highly uncertain 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from  any of our product candidates due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing medical devices  including the uncertainty of the scope  rate of progress and cost of clinical trials and other research and development activities undertaken by us  future clinical trials results  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates and any products that we may develop  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
any failure to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our projects on schedule  or at all  and some consequences of failing to do so  are set forth in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition factors that may affect future results 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure at the date of our financial statements 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are most critical in gaining an understanding of our financial statements include policies and judgments relating to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  inventories and deferred taxes 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note b of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to gaining a full understanding of and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition we comply with the revenue recognition guidelines summarized in staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as updated by sab no 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss  collection of the relevant receivable is probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists a valid purchase order from an approved customer  and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
revenue from licensing agreements is recognized ratably over the period of the related agreement 
we establish reserves for potential sales returns and evaluate the adequacy of those reserves based upon realized experience 
under our current policy  only those products on a customer s initial order qualify for product satisfaction related credit returns 
to date  returns related to product satisfaction have been minimal and immaterial 
while such returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant change in product satisfaction and any resulting credit returns could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize 
in june we entered into an exclusive five month development agreement with a third party for the use of embosphere microspheres for gastroesophegal reflex disease  or gerd 
in exchange for this agreement  we received a payment of  based upon the application of our revenue recognition policies and all related judgments and estimates  we recognized  as licensing revenue over the life of the contract  which concluded in november accounts receivable we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical payment experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
substantially all of our receivables are due from hospitals  distributors  health care clinics  and managed care systems located throughout the united states  canada  europe  asia and south america 
a significant portion of products sold  both foreign and domestic  is ultimately funded through government reimbursement programs 
as a consequence  changes in these programs can have an adverse impact on liquidity and profitability of our customer base 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory or the market value for such inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities in process and on hand and record a provision for production loss and obsolete inventory based primarily on actual loss experience and on our estimated forecast of product demand 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our costs of product sales at the time of such determination 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our production process and forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in production yield or product demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results

total revenues costs of product sales gross margin gross margin revenues 
the million  or increase in revenue in as compared to was primarily due to the following revenues from microspheres and delivery systems in the united states grew approximately  due to increasing market acceptance  which we believe is being fueled by increased adoption within the interventional radiologists community  increased awareness among fibroid patents due to media attention and increasing support of gynecologists  revenues from microspheres and delivery systems in europe increased approximately  due to increased market acceptance of our microspheres and delivery systems  revenues from microspheres and delivery systems in the rest of the world increased approximately  due to our renewed focus on these geographical areas during and to our obtaining approvals to sell our embocath catheter and segway guidewire products in canada and several other latin american countries  we derived  of licensing revenue from a five month agreement for the development of embosphere microspheres for use in the prevention of gastroesophageal reflex disease  or gerd  which concluded in the fourth quarter of  and finally  the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar in  accounted for approximately  of the increase 
as a result of our strategic focus on ufe and other embolotherapy applications using our microsphere products  we expect that sales of embosphere microspheres and our ancillary embolotherapy delivery systems will increase in as compared to cost of product sales 
the million or increase in cost of product sales in as compared to was primarily due to the following factors we recorded a write off of approximately  for in process embogold microsphere and embosphere microspheres inventory related to inventory produced prior to the implementation of an improved manufacturing process in our facility in france  and we recognized approximately  in costs of product sales related to product replacement of embogold microsphere and embosphere syringes 
this replacement was due to shelf life limitations of the saline solution contained within the syringes 
the gross margin decrease of  or as a percent of revenues was primarily attributable to the additional costs related to the write off of in process inventory and expenses associated with the product replaced as a results of the shelf limitations discussed above  offset by increased manufacturing efficiencies  net of foreign currency translation adjustments 
we expect that future gross margin will be highly correlated with the following factors revenue growth  production levels  foreign exchange rate movements  sub contracted manufacturer and supplier agreement terms and conditions  and future inventory reserve requirements

research and development sales marketing general and administrative litigation costs total operating expenses research and development expense 
the  or decrease in research and development expenses in as compared to was primarily due to was a reduction in headcount  which decreased expenses by approximating  after the completion of development related projects in  offset by  of higher costs in france due to the stronger euro and an increase in activity on a joint project in france 
sales expense 
the  or decrease in sales expense in as compared to was due to the elimination of our national sales meeting  which decreased expense by approximately  and other savings on personnel costs  including travel and incentive compensation  which decreased expense by approximately  as selling costs were realigned with realized sales levels in the first half of offsetting these decreases were severance and hiring costs in the fourth quarter of  which totaled approximately  resulting from the departures and addition of certain senior management 
marketing expense 
the million or decrease in marketing expense in as compared to was primarily due to the reduction in expenses related to awareness and education programs associated with promoting the ufe procedure through out askufe campaign as well as a reduction in expenses relating to the promotion of embosphere microspheres  which decreased expenses by approximately million 
additional cost savings in came from reduced overall headcount  which decreased expenses by approximately  and from our decision to limit our head count presence at key trade shows as we sought to keep sales representatives focused on their key accounts in the field  which decreased expenses by approximately  general and administrative expenses 
the  or increase in general and administrative expenses in as compared to was primarily due to the executive transition and severance expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of in connection with the departure and hiring of certain executives of the company 
litigation costs 
in december  we paid damages in a lawsuit brought by terumo europe nv against our french subsidiary  biosphere medical  nv terumo alleged that it suffered damages from a purported termination of the distribution contract by biosphere medical  sa biosphere medical  sa and terumo europe entered into a distribution agreement in january pursuant to which terumo europe became the exclusive distributor of embosphere microsphere and embogold microsphere products in certain countries of europe 
the commercial court of pontoise  france  determined that while both parties had ceased to perform their obligations under the agreement  our termination was not in accordance with the provisions of the agreement 
accordingly  bmsa was required to pay terumo  in damages for breach of contract in december the  charge recorded in the fourth quarter of includes  of related accounts receivable written off in addition to the settlement payment 
interest income  net 
interest income  net of interest expense  is generally incurred in relation to capital leases 
for the year ended december   interest income  net of interest expense  was  as compared to  in  a decrease of 
the decrease in as compared to was due primarily to decreases in the average daily invested cash balances and interest rates on available investment grade assets 
foreign exchange gains  net 
foreign exchange gains and losses primarily resulted from realized euro to us dollar foreign currency fluctuations on euro denominated intercompany trade accounts 
the foreign exchange gains realized during totaled approximately  as compared to gains of approximately  realized during the  decrease was primarily due to higher average intercompany trade receivables  which are denominated in euros  offset by a decrease in the rate that the euro strengthened against the dollar during as compared to income tax provision 
the income tax provision of  primarily represents the reversal of income tax benefits recorded during as management determined in the fourth quarter of that a portion of the taxes paid would not be recovered 
the income tax provision represents minimum corporate taxes due in both france and in the united states 
all other future tax benefits resulting from our operating losses have been reserved for in their entirety  as management believes the ability to realize any benefit against future taxable income is uncertain

total revenues costs of product sales gross margin gross margin revenues 
of the  or  increase in total revenues in as compared to   was due to the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar 
the remaining  increase was due to worldwide sales growth of our embocath catheter and our segway guidewire  both of which were launched in the fourth quarter of the majority of our revenues in was derived from the sale of embosphere microspheres  as a result of our strategic focus on ufe and other embolotherapy applications using our microsphere products 
cost of product sales 
the million  or increase in cost of product sales in as compared to was primarily due to the following factors our manufacturing overhead increased  in from the establishment of a us manufacturing team that we expect will assist in improving the overall quality and efficiency of the manufacturing process and increase the capacity of our french manufacturing facility  the european launch of embosphere microspheres in sterile syringe packages that are manufactured through a sub contractor agreement resulted in higher total unit cost  which contributed  to the increase  we experienced a foreign currency impact of  due to a stronger euro against the us dollar  we reserved an additional  in as compared to for obsolescence of specific sizes of embosphere microspheres and embogold microspheres that were historically slow moving  we launched our segway guidewire and embocath catheter in the fourth quarter of  and we experienced  in additional cost of product sales in in connection with a full year of sales volume  and we incurred a one time expense of  to streamline the delivery system supply chain  which is expected to result in future manufacturing cost savings 
gross margin decreased to in  a decline of from gross margin in  primarily due to the addition of fixed costs of product sales as described above  net of foreign currency translation adjustments

research and development sales marketing general and administrative total operating expenses research and development expense 
the million or decrease in research and development expense in as compared to was primarily due to the completion of our pivotal phase ii clinical trials in to support fda specific labeling clearance to use our microsphere products in the treatment of uterine fibroids 
total clinical costs were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
also contributing to the decrease in total research and development expenses in was a reduction in certain non essential headcount after the completion of development related projects in we estimate that during the years ended december  and  the majority of our research and development expenses were related to clinical trial costs  development and validation of our new embolotherapy products and packaging formats  development and validation of our embocath catheter and segway guidewire  as well as salary and related benefit expenses and laboratory supplies related to our radiosphere  temprx and hepasphere sap programs 
sales expense 
the  or increase in sales expense in as compared to was primarily due to salary and salary related benefits as a result of an increase in headcount in the us sales force and to a lesser degree the stronger euro against the us dollar 
sales expense in included  of stock based compensation to non employees marketing expense 
the million or increase in marketing expense in as compared to was primarily due to expenses relating to our ufe awareness and education programs 
marketing expense in also includes  of stock based compensation to non employees 
general and administrative expenses

foreign exchange gains for the year ended december  increased to  from  in the increase in due primarily to realized euro to us dollar foreign currency exchange gains associated with our intercompany trade accounts 
income tax benefit provision 
the income tax provision represents minimum corporate taxes due in both france and in the united states 
income tax benefit recorded during represents recoverable prior year tax expense 
all other future tax benefits resulting from our operating losses have been reserved for in their entirety  as management believes the ability to realize any benefit against future taxable income is uncertain 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  an increase of million from million at december  this increase was primarily the result of our million private placement of series a convertible preferred stock in november  offset by operating losses and euro to us dollar foreign exchange rate changes 
we have historically funded our operations from the net proceeds provided by public and private equity offerings  net revenues  bank financing  equipment financing leases and  to a lesser extent the exercise of stock options 
the net cash used in operating activities includes a net loss of million adjusted for million in non cash charges 
accounts receivable increased  on higher sales  as days sales outstanding remained consistent with at days 
accrued compensation increased  as a result of costs associated with the senior management transition  which occurred in the fourth quarter of and will be paid out in as of december   we had million in working capital 
cash used in operations is expected to decrease during as anticipated increases in product sales are expected to partially offset our operational and product development expenditures 
in we spent  to purchase manufacturing equipment at our facility in roissy  france and other equipment to support our existing infrastructure 
we anticipate that the level of capital expenditures over the next months will increase as we configure our roissy  france facility to produce hepasphere sap microspheres in net cash provided by financing activities was million for the months ended december   which included net proceeds of million from our private placement of series a preferred stock and  from the exercise of common stock options and other employee incentive plans 
additional financing totaling  in the form of capital equipment leases was secured during if available on favorable terms  we expect to finance future fixed asset acquisitions through leasing arrangements 
on november   we completed a private placement of million of our series a convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock with sepracor inc and affiliates of cerberus capital management  lp  two of our existing investors 
these investors purchased a total of  shares of series a preferred stock which are initially convertible into  shares of common stock based upon a conversion price of per share 
in addition  we have the right to convert the series a preferred stock into common stock  or redeem it  under specified circumstances 
the series a preferred stock has a dividend  which is payable quarterly in either cash or additional shares of series a preferred stock  at our election 
we also issued the investors warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
these warrants expire five years from the date of issuance and have an initial exercise price of per share 
these warrants have been assigned a value of  using the black scholes option pricing model 
borrowing arrangements on february   we entered into a four year capital lease agreement for the purchase of manufacturing equipment at our facility in roissy  france 
the amount of the lease is  payable over months  at an effective annual interest rate of 
as of december  there was  outstanding under this capital lease agreement 
on june   we entered into an agreement to extend the existing two year credit facility with a bank originally entered into in may the amended agreement provides that the credit facility will contain all of the terms and conditions of our original credit facility  with the exceptions that the maximum amount under which we could borrow for general working capital and corporate purposes  subject to limitations defined in the agreement  was reduced from million to million 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement as of december  each available   or day advance will bear interest at a per annum rate  at our option  equal to either i a variable rate as determined by the bank or ii a rate equal to the corresponding   or day libor rate as of december  plus a libor advance rate spread as determined by certain current working capital balances at the time of the advance 
our ability to borrow under this credit line is limited to eligible receivables as defined by the agreement and to the maintenance of certain levels of cash and cash equivalents of at least one and one half times the outstanding principal balance of the note 
as of december  there was approximately million available to borrow under this credit facility 
in connection with the credit facility  we entered into a security agreement pursuant to which we have pledged to the bank all of our us assets  excluding our equity ownership of bmsa  as collateral 
as of december   we were in compliance in all material respects with all credit facility covenants 
in march  bmsa entered into a   equivalent as of december  term loan with a french national bank that is payable in euros over four years and accrues interest at per annum 
the total loan balance outstanding as of december  was approximately  other contractual obligations as of december   we are party to two operating leases for the lease of our facilities in rockland  massachusetts and roissy  france 
the roissy  france operating lease expires in may on january   we amended the lease for the office and laboratory facility we currently occupy in rockland  massachusetts 
pursuant to this amendment  the leases premises is decreased to a total area of approximately  square feet at a monthly cost of  per month  and the term of the lease is extended from march  to march  in addition to the capital lease agreement we entered into in february  we are party to several other non cancelable capital lease agreements with various equipment financing companies  related to the acquisition of certain manufacturing and computer equipment during the equipment leases have initial terms of to months with interest rates of to 
equipment leased under these arrangements serves as pledged capital with respect to each capital lease agreement 
future cash payments  including interest  under contractual obligations in effect as of december   are as follows period total contractual in thousands thereafter obligations operating leases capital leases term loans total we believe that the approximate million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities that we have as of december   together with anticipated proceeds from sales of our microspheres  delivery systems and other products will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital requirements  as currently planned  into the fourth quarter of in the longer term we expect to fund our operations and sustaining capital requirements through a combination of expected proceeds from product sales and capital equipment financing 
however  our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned due to a number of factors  including  without limitation  our failure to achieve expected revenue amounts  costs associated with changes in our ufe marketing programs  anticipated research and development expenses  the scope and results of pre clinical and clinical testing  changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs  competitive and technological advances  the timing and results of fda regulatory review and the market s acceptance of any approved products  including our embosphere microspheres for ufe and hepasphere sap microspheres 
we may incur additional costs  including costs related to ongoing research and development activities  pre clinical studies  clinical trials  the expansion of our manufacturing  laboratory and administrative functions  as well as costs relating to further market development and commercialization efforts 
we may also need additional funds for such activities and for possible strategic acquisitions of synergistic businesses  products and or technologies 
these additional funds may be substantial and raised from time to time through additional public or private sales of equity  through borrowings  or through other financings 
there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain any additional funding that may be required  or that any such funding will be on acceptable terms 
related party transactions on november   we entered into a securities purchase agreement with sepracor inc and cerberus partners  lp  pursuant to which we sold to each of sepracor and cerberus  respectively  i  shares of our series a convertible preferred stock  par value per share  and ii warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock  for aggregate gross proceeds to us of million 
sepracor and cerberus each are beneficial owners of more than five percent of our outstanding capital stock 
messrs 
barberich and southwell  directors of our company  are the chairman and chief executive officer and the chief financial officer  respectively  of sepracor 
pursuant to the terms of the securities purchase agreement  we agreed to indemnify sepracor and cerberus and specified related parties of each entity against damages with respect to breaches of representations  warranties  covenants and agreements made by us under the securities purchase agreement and related transaction documents 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements 
inflation we believe that the effects of inflation generally do not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r 
sfas r addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas r supersedes apb no 
and requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
sfas r requires companies to recognize an expense for compensation cost related to share based payment arrangements including stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
we are required to implement the proposed standard no later than july  the cumulative effect of adoption  applied on a modified retrospective basis  would be measured and recognized on july  we are currently evaluating option valuation methodologies and assumptions related to stock compensation plans 
as permitted by statement  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position and cash position 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss per share as illustrated in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp  in response to the american jobs creation act of which was signed into law in october  and which provides for a special one time tax deduction of of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated as defined 
based on our decision to reinvest rather than to repatriate current and prior year s unremitted foreign earnings  the application of fsp did not affect income tax expense in the period of enactment or any related disclosures 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas is the result of a broader effort by the fasb to improve the comparability of cross border financial reporting by working with the international accounting standards board iasb toward development of a single set of high quality accounting standards 
the fasb and the iasb noted that arb  chapter and ias  inventories  require that abnormal amounts of idle freight  handling costs  and wasted materials be recognized as period costs  however  the boards noted that differences in the wording of the two standards could lead to inconsistent application of those similar requirements 
the fasb concluded that clarifying the existing requirements in arb by adopting language similar to that used in ias is consistent with its goals of improving financial reporting in the united states and promoting convergence of accounting standards internationally 
adoption of sfas is required for fiscal years beginning after june  the provisions of sfas will be applied prospectively 
we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact that sfas  but do not expect it will have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
factors that may affect future results risk relating to our future profitability because we have a history of losses and our future profitability is uncertain  our common stock is a speculative investment 
we have incurred operating losses since our inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we have incurred net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect to spend substantial funds to continue research and product testing  to maintain sales  marketing  quality control  regulatory  manufacturing and administrative capabilities and for other general corporate purposes 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses beyond the fourth quarter of  as we continue our commercialization efforts 
we may never become profitable 
if we do become profitable  we may not remain profitable on a continuing basis 
our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital and expand  diversify or continue our operations 
risks relating to our financial results and need for financing we will continue to need additional funds  and if additional capital is not available  we may have to limit  scale back or cease our operations 
we believe that our existing cash and other working capital  together with the proceeds from the million private placement we completed on november   together with anticipated proceeds from sales of our products will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital requirements  as currently planned  into the fourth quarter of our currently planned operating and capital requirements primarily include the need for working capital to produce and manufacture our products  support our sales and marketing efforts for our embosphere microspheres products for ufe and other indications as well as our other products for sale  support our research and development activities  and fund our general and administrative costs and expenses 
however  our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned due to a number of factors  including  without limitation  the amount of revenues we generate from sales of our products  in particular from the use of our embosphere microspheres for ufe  changes in our ufe regulatory and marketing programs  anticipated research and development efforts  cost and time involved in pre clinical and clinical testing  costs resulting from changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs  competitive advances that make it harder for us to market and sell our products  the timing and cost of fda regulatory review and the market s acceptance of any approved products 
we also expect to incur additional costs related to ongoing research and development activities  pre clinical studies  clinical trials  the expansion of our manufacturing  laboratory and administrative functions  as well as costs relating to further market development and commercialization efforts 
we may also need additional funds for possible strategic acquisitions of synergistic businesses  products and or technologies 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some of our research  development  sales and marketing initiatives  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and ability to achieve profitability 
we may need to raise additional funds to develop and commercialize our new products successfully 
if we cannot fund these new products through cash generated from existing operations and cannot raise more funds  we could be required to reduce our capital expenditures  scale back our product development  reduce our workforce and license to others products or technologies that we otherwise would seek to commercialize ourselves 
although we may seek additional funding through collaborative arrangements  borrowing money or the sale of additional equity securities  we may not receive additional funding on reasonable terms  or at all 
any sales of additional shares of our capital stock are likely to dilute our existing stockholders 
further  if we issue additional equity securities  the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock 
alternatively  we may borrow money from commercial lenders  possibly at high interest rates  which will increase the risk of your investment in us 
if operating results fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  then our stock price may decline 
our operating results could fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
these fluctuations may be due to several factors  including the timing and volume of customer orders for our products  procedure cancellations  introduction or announcement of competitive products and general economic conditions 
due to these fluctuations  our operating results in some quarters may not meet the expectations of our investors 
in that case  our stock price may decline 
in addition  a large portion of our expenses  including expenses for facilities  equipment and personnel  are relatively fixed 
accordingly  if our revenues decline or do not grow as much as we anticipate  we might not be able to improve our operating margins 
failure to achieve anticipated levels of revenues could therefore significantly harm our operating results for a particular fiscal period 
risks relating to our industry  business and strategy if we do not achieve widespread market acceptance of our microspheres products  our business prospects will be seriously harmed 
our microspheres are based on new technologies and therapeutic approaches 
in the united states  we began selling our microspheres product in the first half of in november  we received fda clearance to market our embosphere microspheres in the united states for specific use in the embolization of uterine fibroids 
our success will depend upon increasing acceptance by the medical community  patients and third party payers that our embosphere microspheres and other products are medically therapeutic and cost effective 
our embolotherapy techniques are administered by interventional radiologists 
to date we have not achieved widespread market acceptance of our embosphere microspheres or other products 
we believe that we have not yet achieved widespread acceptance primarily because obstetrics and gynecology physicians may elect to offer and provide other forms of treatment to their patients with uterine fibroids that do not require a referral to another specialist  such as an interventional radiologist 
accordingly  our future success will depend upon obstetrics and gynecology physicians referring patients to interventional radiologists to receive treatment using our embosphere microspheres in lieu of  or in addition to  receiving other forms of treatment that the obstetrics and gynecology physicians can otherwise provide directly 
negative publicity associated with any adverse medical effects attributed to embolization treatments generally  or our products specifically  may create the market perception that our products are unsafe 
for example  patients commonly experience a day or two of post procedure abdominal pain or cramping 
other infrequently occurring complications may include allergic reactions  rashes  early onset of menopause  infertility and infection that may  in some cases  require a hysterectomy 
we are also aware that a small number of the patient population  which we believe constitute approximately of those receiving the ufe procedure using embogold microspheres  reported a delayed onset of pain and or rash 
if our microsphere products are not properly used or if the market concludes that our products are not safe or effective  our business could be adversely affected 
our microspheres are designed to permanently occlude blood vessels 
there is some risk that some or all of the microspheres used in a medical procedure may travel in the blood system to sites other than the intended surgical site and occlude  or block  other blood vessels  resulting in the potential for significant adverse health effects on the patient or  in a worst case  even death 
moreover  to use our microspheres correctly for a particular medical procedure  trained physicians must select and use the proper size and quantity 
a physician s selection and use of the wrong size or quantity of our microspheres could potentially have significant adverse health effects on the patient  including death 
it is necessary for us to educate physicians about the selection and use of the proper size and quantity of microspheres in patient therapy 
in addition  there is only limited data concerning the long term health effects on persons receiving embolotherapy using our microspheres 
for example  the effect of uterine fibroid embolization on continued fertility has not yet been specifically studied and our fda clearance for embosphere microspheres currently does not include women who desire future pregnancy 
if we are not able to successfully educate physicians to properly use our product  or if the market determines or concludes that any of our products are not safe or effective for any reason  we may be exposed to product liability claims  product recalls  fines or other penalties or enforcement actions by regulatory agencies and associated adverse publicity 
in addition  we have provided to our customers a satisfaction guarantee that requires us to accept the return of any inventory and credit the entire amount of the original order if a properly trained customer is not satisfied with the performance of either our microspheres  our embocath catheter  or our segway guidewire products 
if we experience adverse publicity or are subject to product liability claims  excessive guarantee claims  recalls  fines and the like  we will be unable to achieve widespread market acceptance of our microsphere products and achieve profitability 
if we do not successfully market and promote our embosphere microspheres for use in uterine fibroid embolization  our product revenues will not increase 
in the first quarter of  we launched our askufe campaign to increase awareness among patients  referring physicians  interventional radiologists and third party payers of ufe as an alternative treatment for fibroids 
we believe the majority of our revenues in the united states for the two years ended december  was derived from the sale of embosphere microspheres and embogold microspheres  for use in ufe 
although we believe that embogold microspheres accounted for a significant portion of revenue  we currently do not intend to seek k clearance for use of embogold microspheres in ufe 
because we do not intend to seek k clearance of embogold microspheres  we believe that our future product revenues are substantially dependent on our ability to achieve awareness of the use of embosphere microspheres for the treatment of ufe  and if we do not achieve increased awareness  our product revenues profitability and success will be adversely affected 
if we cease to market embogold microspheres for any reason  we could incur substantial costs to write off and replace existing inventories 
as of december   we had embogold inventory with a carrying value of  including in process inventory of  and finished goods syringes of  we currently believe no provision for the write off or replacement of embogold microspheres inventory is required in the accompanying financial statements 
if we experience delays  difficulties or unanticipated costs in establishing the sales  distribution and marketing capabilities necessary to successfully commercialize our products  we will have difficulty maintaining and increasing our sales 
we are continuing to develop sales  distribution and marketing capabilities in the united states  the european union  asia and in south america 
in  we began a marketing strategy to promote ufe awareness and the benefits of our product for the treatment of uterine fibroids 
it will be expensive and time consuming for us to develop a global marketing and sales force 
moreover  we may choose  or find it necessary  to enter into strategic collaborations to sell  market and distribute our products 
we may not be able to provide adequate incentive to our sales force or to establish and maintain favorable distribution and marketing collaborations with other companies to promote our products 
we currently have distribution agreements with approximately third party distributors 
any third party with whom we have established a marketing and distribution relationship may not devote sufficient time to the marketing and sales of our products thereby exposing us to potential expenses in terminating such distribution agreements 
for example  our subsidiary  biosphere medical sa  or bsma  ended its distribution agreement with terumo nv in in part because of terumo s failure to achieve sales forecasts agreed upon by the parties 
as a result of subsequent litigation  bsma was required to pay terumo approximately  in damages arising from such termination and incurred additional legal and administrative expenses incident to the legal proceeding 
we and any of our third party collaborators must also market our products in compliance with federal  state and local laws relating to the providing of incentives and inducements 
violation of these laws can result in substantial penalties 
if we are unable to successfully motivate and expand our marketing and sales force and further develop our sales and marketing capabilities  or if our distributors fail to promote our products  we will have difficulty maintaining and increasing our sales 
we may be required to expend significant resources for research  development  testing and regulatory approval of our products under development  and these products may not be developed successfully 
we are developing and commercializing products for medical applications using embolotherapy techniques 
most of our next generation embolotherapy product candidates are still in the early stages of research and development 
our products may not provide greater benefits than current treatments or products  or alternative treatments or products under development 
all of our products under development will require significant additional research  development  pre clinical and or clinical testing  regulatory approval and a commitment of significant additional resources prior to their commercialization 
our potential products may not be developed successfully  be proven safe and effective in clinical trials  offer therapeutic or other improvements over current treatments and products  meet applicable regulatory standards or receive regulatory approvals  be capable of production in commercial quantities at acceptable costs  or be successfully marketed 
if we do not develop and introduce new products  we may not achieve additional revenue opportunities 
we derived approximately of our revenues for the period ended december  from the sale of non strategic medical products that over time we expect will constitute a less significant portion of our revenues on an ongoing basis 
these non strategic medical products include barium delivery kits sold by us in the european union  as well as other ancillary devices for hospital and physician use 
in addition  we estimate that a significant portion of our revenues for the year ended december  and was derived from the sale of embogold microspheres for ufe  an indication for which we do not have  and do not presently intend to seek clearance from the fda to market 
we made the decision not to seek fda clearance for our embogold microsphere product because of reports that a small number of patients treated with ufe using embogold microspheres  which we believe constitute approximately of the total number of patients receiving the procedure  reported a delayed onset of pain and or rash 
accordingly  we need to develop and introduce new applications for our embolotherapy technology and pursue opportunities for microsphere technology in other medical applications 
any such new application for our embotherapy technology or microsphere technology will be subject to a number of risks inherent in the development and commercialization of a medical device product  including uncertainties with respect to the successful completion of clinical trails  our ability to achieve and maintain  and our willingness to seek  required regulatory approvals and our ability to successfully commercialize  market and sell these new applications assuming fda approval is achieved 
if  as a result of these or other risks  we are not successful in developing new applications and products  we will not achieve new revenue opportunities 
if we are unable to obtain or maintain adequate product liability insurance  then we may have to pay significant monetary damages in a successful product liability claim against us 
the development and sale of medical devices entails an inherent risk of product liability 
for example  if we are not able to successfully educate physicians to properly use our products  or if the market determines or concludes that any of our products are not safe or effective for any reason  we may be exposed to product liability claims 
although we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage for our products  our existing insurance and any additional insurance we may subsequently obtain may not provide us with adequate coverage against all potential claims 
if we are exposed to product liability claims for which we have insufficient insurance  we may be required to pay significant damages  which would prevent or delay our ability to commercialize our products and could harm our business and results of operations 
if we are not able to compete effectively  we may experience decreased demand for our products  which may result in price reductions 
we have many competitors in the united states and abroad  including medical device  biotechnology and other alternative therapeutic companies  universities and other private and public research institutions 
we have experienced increased competition since receiving fda approval for use of our embosphere microsphere for ufe 
our success depends upon our ability to develop and maintain a competitive position in both the embolotherapy and related delivery systems markets 
our key competitors in both the fields of embolotherapy and the delivery systems used in the ufe procedure are angiodynamics incorporated  biocompatibles  ltd  boston scientific corporation  cook incorporated  cordis corporation  a johnson and johnson company  pfizer  inc and terumo corporation 
these and many of our other competitors have greater capabilities  experience and financial resources than we do 
as a result  they may develop products quicker or at less cost  that compete with our microsphere products and related delivery systems 
in addition  we may experience decreased demand for our products if these or other competitors announce that they have begun to develop products that compete with our products 
for example  in  some of our competitors provided free or reduced price samples of competing forms of microspheres for the treatment of medical procedures for which our embosphere microspheres are indicated 
the availability of these free or reduced priced samples has had  and may continue to have  a material adverse effect on our product revenues  primarily due to a loss of market share for the sale of our products 
currently  the primary products with which our microspheres compete for some of our applications are spherical polyvinyl alcohol  sold by boston scientific  terumo and biocompatibles and  gel foam  sold by pfizer  and non spherical polyvinyl alcohol  sold by angiodynamics  boston scientific and cook 
in addition  our competitors may develop technologies that render our products obsolete or otherwise noncompetitive 
we may not be able to improve our products or develop new products or technologies quickly enough to maintain a competitive position in our market and continue to commercially develop our business 
moreover  we may not be able to compete effectively  and competitive pressures may result in less demand for our products and impair our ability to become profitable 
if we fail to maintain  or in some instances obtain  an adequate level of reimbursement for our products by third party payers  there may be no commercially viable markets for our products 
the availability and levels of reimbursement by governmental and other third party payers affects the market for any medical device 
we may not be able to sell our products profitably if reimbursement is unavailable or limited in scope or amount 
some insurance companies do not fully reimburse for embolization procedures 
these third party payers attempt to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare by challenging the prices that companies such as ours charge for medical products 
in some foreign countries  particularly the countries of the european union where our microsphere products are currently marketed and sold  the pricing of medical devices is subject to governmental control  and the prices charged for our products have in some instances been reduced as a result of these controls 
initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs  including price regulation  are underway in the united states and other major healthcare markets 
for example  these proposals include prescription drug benefit legislation recently enacted in the united states  and healthcare reform initiatives proposed in certain state and local jurisdictions and other countries 
while these initiatives have in many cases related to pharmaceutical pricing  implementation of more sweeping healthcare reforms in significant markets may limit the price of  or the level at which reimbursement is provided for  the company s products and may influence a physician s selection of products used to treat patients 
if we do not retain our senior management  other key employees  scientific collaborators and advisors  we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy  changes in management could result in short term disruption to our business 
the loss of key members of our management team could harm us 
we have recently experienced significant changes in management 
in november  richard faleschini joined us as our president and chief executive officer and gary m 
saxton joined us as vice president of marketing and sales  and in september  martin joyce joined us as our chief financial officer 
our senior management team also includes jonathan r 
mcgrath  vice president  research and development 
our former president and chief executive officer  paul a 
looney  only served as our president and chief executive officer for approximately months and our former vice president of us sales and marketing  thomas keenan  served as our vice president of us sales for approximately months 
disruptions in our business could result in the near term as a result of changes in our management such as the departures of messrs 
looney and keenan  and the integration of our new management team into our company 
our success is substantially dependent on the ability  experience and performance of these members of our senior management and other key employees 
we currently have employment agreements with each of our executive officers  other than mr 
saxton 
these employment agreements are generally for a term of one year and are subject to annual renewal 
either party has the right to terminate the agreement at any time for any reason or no reason on days prior written notice  except that we can terminate mr 
joyce s agreement within the first year without notice 
we do not carry key man life insurance on any of our executive officers or other personnel 
we also depend on approximately scientific collaborators and advisors  all of whom have other commitments that may limit their availability to us 
because of their ability and experience  if we lose one or more of these individuals  we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy 
if we make any acquisitions  we will incur a variety of costs and may never successfully integrate the acquired business into ours 
we may attempt to acquire businesses  technologies  services or products that we believe are a strategic complement to our business model 
we may encounter operating difficulties and expenditures relating to integrating an acquired business  technology  service or product 
these acquisitions may also absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
moreover  we may never realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition 
we may also make dilutive issuances of equity securities  incur debt or experience a decrease in the cash available for our operations  or incur contingent liabilities in connection with any future acquisitions 
because key stockholders beneficially own a significant amount of our common stock  they may be able to exert control over us 
as of the completion of our private placement on november   sepracor inc and funds affiliated with cerberus capital management  lp beneficially owned approximately and of our outstanding common stock  respectively  including shares of common stock issuable as of november  upon the exercise of warrants and series a preferred stock held by these stockholders 
moreover  two of our directors are executive officers of sepracor and we have granted board observation rights to cerberus 
accordingly  sepracor and cerberus may have significant influence over corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  such as the election of directors  amendment of our charter documents and the approval of merger or significant asset sale transactions 
in addition  the shares of our series a preferred stock held by sepracor and cerberus entitled them to certain voting rights in accordance with the terms and conditions of the series a preferred stock 
specifically  we will need the consent of holders of at least of the series a preferred stock initially purchased by sepracor and cerberus to undertake certain key corporate actions  including the following amending our charter or bylaws in a manner that adversely affects the holders of series a preferred stock  authorizing or issuing any equity security that is senior to or pari passu with the series a preferred stock  and declaring or paying any dividends on  or redeeming or repurchasing any shares of our capital stock  subject to customary exceptions 
in addition  on december   we entered into a restrictive covenants agreement with sepracor and cerberus  pursuant to which we agreed not to issue any shares of common stock upon conversion of the series a preferred stock and or upon exercise of the warrants held by these stockholders to the extent that such conversion and or exercise would result in i a change of control within the meaning of the nasdaq marketplace rules  or ii the aggregate issuance of more than of our common stock outstanding as of november  pursuant to the terms of the restrictive covenants agreement  both sepracor and cerberus also agreed to limit the number of shares of common stock each entity would vote  in respect of the shares of series a preferred stock held  on matters in which holders of our series a preferred stock and our common stock vote as one class  to no more than the quotient of x the aggregate purchase price paid by such entity for its series a preferred shares divided by y the closing bid price of the common stock on the initial issuance date of the series a preferred stock 
we also agreed with these investors that we will submit to our stockholders for approval amendments to the certificate of designations  preferences and rights of series a preferred stock we filed with the secretary of state of the state of delaware on november  to effect the modifications to the terms of the series a preferred stock set forth in the restrictive covenants agreement 
sepracor and cerberus have agreed to vote in favor of such amendments to the certificate of designations and have granted an irrevocable proxy to appoint our chief executive officer and vice president of finance as attorney in fact and proxy to vote all of their shares of common stock  other than the shares underlying the series a preferred stock and warrants  in favor of such amendments 
the ownership concentration of sepracor and cerberus could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
in addition  conflicts of interest between these key stockholders and us may arise  including with respect to competitive business activities and control of our management and our affairs 
the holders of shares of our series a preferred stock have rights that could adversely affect an investment in our common stock 
the holders of our series a preferred stock have the right to an adjustment in the conversion rate of the series a preferred stock if we issue securities at a price below the purchase price paid by these holders 
these provisions could substantially dilute your interest in biosphere in the event of future financing transactions 
the holders of series a preferred stock also have the right to receive a dividend per annum which  at our election  may be paid in cash or additional shares of series a preferred stock 
if paid in stock  this dividend could also further dilute your ownership interest 
in addition  the holders of our series a preferred stock have the right to participate in future capital raising transactions by biosphere 
the existence of this right may reduce our ability to establish terms with respect to  or enter into  any financing with parties other than the investors 
in the event that we enter into an acquisition or business combination in which we sell all or substantially all of our assets or if there occurs a change of control of a majority of our common stock outstanding prior to such transaction  the holders of our series a preferred stock will have the right to receive  before any distributions or payments to the holders of our common stock  an amount in cash equal to their initial purchase price   plus an amount equal to any accrued but unpaid dividends  and will then participate with the holders of the common stock on a pro rata basis with respect to the distribution of any remaining assets 
the existence of this right may make it difficult for us to raise capital in financing transactions with third parties and will also result in holders of our common stock receiving less distributions or payments upon a change of control or asset sale than they would be entitled to receive if no preferential payments were required to be made to holders of our series a preferred stock 
risks relating to regulatory matters if we do not obtain and maintain the regulatory approvals or clearances required to market and sell our products  then our business may be unsuccessful and the market price of our stock may decline 
we are subject to regulation by government agencies in the united states and abroad with respect to the manufacture  packaging  labeling  advertising  promotion  distribution and sale of our products 
for example  our products are subject to approval or clearance by the fda prior to commercial marketing in the united states 
similar regulations exist in most major foreign markets  including the european union  latin america and asia 
the process of obtaining necessary regulatory approvals and clearances will be time consuming and expensive for us 
if we do not receive required regulatory approval or clearance to market our products  or if any approvals we have received are revoked or terminated  we may not be able to develop and commercialize our products and become profitable  and the value of our common stock may decline 
if the fda or other regulatory agencies place restrictions on  or impose additional approval requirements with respect to products we are then marketing  we may incur substantial additional costs and experience delays or difficulties in continuing to market and sell these products 
even if the fda grants us clearance with respect to marketing any product it may place substantial restrictions on the indications for which we may market the product  which could result in lower revenues 
the marketing claims we are permitted to make in labeling or advertising regarding our microspheres are limited to those consistent with any fda clearance or approval 
for example  because our embogold microspheres are not cleared for use in ufe  we may not promote them for this use 
we may in the future make modifications to our microspheres or their labeling which we determine do not necessitate the filing of a new k notification 
however  if the fda does not agree with our determination  it will require us to make additional k filings for the modification  and we may be prohibited from marketing the modified product or the new claims until we obtain fda clearance 
similarly  if we obtain pre market approval  we may not be able to make product or labeling changes until we get further fda approval 
further  the fda has classified our embolotherapy device into class iii  which means that even though we have obtained clearance under section k to market the device for certain indications  the fda could in the future promulgate a regulation requiring that we submit a pre market approval as a pre amended device of the device under section of the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act to allow it to remain on the market 
if the fda were to issue such a regulation  we may experience difficulty in providing the fda with sufficient data for pre market approval in a timely fashion  if at all 
our products will be subject to continuing fda requirements relating to quality control  quality assurance  maintenance of records and documentation  manufacturing  labeling and promotion of medical devices 
we are also required to submit medical device reports to the fda to report device related deaths or serious injuries  as well as malfunctions  the recurrence of which would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury 
these reports are publicly available 
we are also subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  manufacturing and marketing authorization  pricing and third party reimbursement 
the foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with fda approval described above as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of local regulations in foreign jurisdictions 
approval by the fda does not assure approval by regulatory authorities outside the us many foreign regulatory authorities  including those in major markets such as japan and china  have different approval procedures than those required by the fda and may impose additional testing requirements for our medical device candidates 
if we fail to comply with regulatory laws and requirements  we will be subject to enforcement actions  which will affect our ability to market and sell our products and may harm our reputation 
if we fail to comply with applicable federal  state or foreign laws or regulations  we could be subject to enforcement actions  which could affect our ability to develop  market and sell our products successfully and could harm our reputation and lead to less acceptance of our products by the market 
these enforcement actions include product seizures  voluntary or mandatory recalls  voluntary or mandatory patient or physician notification  withdrawal of product clearances or approvals  withdrawal of investigational device exemption approval  restrictions on  or prohibitions against  marketing our products  fines  restrictions on importation or exportation of our products  injunctions  and civil and criminal penalties 
risks relating to our intellectual property if we are unable to obtain patent protection for our products  their competitive value could decline 
we may not obtain meaningful protection for our technology and products with the patents and patent applications that we own or license relating to our microsphere technology or other ancillary products 
in particular  the patent rights we possess or are pursuing generally cover our technologies to varying degrees  and these rights may not prevent others from designing products similar to or otherwise competitive with our embosphere microspheres and other products commercialized by us 
to the extent that our competitors are able to design products competitive with ours  we may experience less market penetration with our products and  consequently  we may have decreased revenues 
we do not know whether competitors have similar united states patent applications on file  since united states patent applications filed before november  or for which no foreign patents will be sought are secret until issued  and applications filed after november  are published approximately months after their earliest priority date 
consequently  the united states patent and trademark office could initiate interference proceedings involving our owned or licensed united states patent applications or issued patents 
further  there is a substantial backlog of patent applications at the united states patent and trademark office  and the approval or rejection of patent applications may take several years 
we require our employees  consultants and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements 
however  we cannot guarantee that these agreements will provide us with adequate protection against improper use or disclosure of confidential information 
in addition  in some situations  these agreements may conflict with  or be subject to  the rights of third parties with whom our employees  consultants or advisors have prior employment or consulting relationships 
further  others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques  or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets 
our failure to protect our proprietary information and techniques may inhibit or limit our ability to exclude certain competitors from the market 
if we become involved in expensive patent litigation or other proceedings to enforce or defend our patent rights  we could incur substantial costs and expenses or substantial liability for damages or be required to stop our product development and commercialization efforts 
on january   an opposition proceeding was brought by biocompatibles uk limited against our granted european patent relating to polyvinyl alcohol microspheres useful for embolization and methods thereof 
we intend to file a response to the opponent s brief prior to the deadline of june  while we are not able to predict the outcome of this proceeding  it will not impact our ability to sell our embosphere products 
with the exception of the european opposition proceeding just described  we are not currently involved in any other litigation  or actions with third parties to enforce or defend our patent rights 
however  in order to protect or enforce our patent rights  we may have to initiate legal proceedings against third parties  such as infringement suits or interference proceedings 
by initiating legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights  we may also provoke these third parties to assert claims against us and  as a result  our patents could be narrowed  invalidated or rendered unenforceable by a court 
furthermore  we may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others 
we may find it necessary  if threatened  to initiate a lawsuit seeking a declaration from a court regarding the proprietary rights of others 
intellectual property litigation is costly  and  even if we prevail  could divert management attention and resources away from our business 
the patent position of companies like ours generally is highly uncertain  involves complex legal and factual questions  and has recently been the subject of much litigation 
we may not prevail in any patent related proceeding 
if we do not prevail in any litigation  we could be required to pay damages  stop the infringing activity  or obtain a license 
any required license might not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  some licenses may be nonexclusive  and therefore  our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us 
if we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent  we may be prevented from selling some of our products  which could decrease our revenues 
if any of our licenses to use third party technologies in our products are terminated  we may be unable to develop  market or sell our products 
we are dependent on various license agreements relating to each of our current and proposed products that give us rights under intellectual property rights of third parties 
in particular  we have an agreement with l assistance publique hopitaux de paris  pursuant to which l assistance publique hopitaux de paris has granted us exclusive rights to use two jointly owned patents relating to embosphere microspheres 
we also have an agreement with dr 
shinichi hori pursuant to which we have an exclusive royalty bearing license to japanese patent rights for our hepasphere sap microspheres product 
either of these agreements can be terminated on short notice by the licensor if we default on our obligations under the license and fail to cure such default after notice is provided 
these licenses impose commercialization  sublicensing  royalty  insurance and other obligations on us 
our failure  or any third party s failure  to comply with the terms of any of these licenses could result in our losing our rights to the license  which could result in our being unable to develop  manufacture or sell products which contain the licensed technology 
risks relating to the production and supply of our products if we experience manufacturing delays or interruptions in production  then we may experience customer dissatisfaction and our reputation could suffer 
if we fail to produce enough products at our own manufacturing facility or at a third party manufacturing facility  we may be unable to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis  which could lead to customer dissatisfaction and could harm our reputation and ability to compete 
we currently produce and package all of our microsphere products in one manufacturing facility in france 
in the us  we have engaged radius medical technologies  inc to supply our guidewire product and accellent to supply and package our catheter product 
either we or any third party manufacturer would likely experience significant delays or cessation in producing our products if a labor strike  natural disaster  local or regional conflict or other supply disruption were to occur 
if we are unable to manufacture and package our products at our facility in france  we may be required to enter into arrangements with one or more alternative contract manufacturing companies 
in addition  if we are required to depend on third party manufacturers  our profit margins may be lower  which will make it more difficult for us to achieve profitability 
medical device manufacturers must adhere to the fda s current good manufacturing practices regulations  which are enforced by the fda through its facilities inspection program 
the manufacturers may not be able to comply or maintain compliance with good manufacturing practices regulations 
if any third party manufacturers we engage fail to comply  their noncompliance could significantly delay our receipt of new product premarket approvals or result in fda enforcement action  including an embargo on imported devices 
for a premarket approval device  if we change our manufacturing facility or switch to a third party manufacturer  we will be required to submit a premarket approval application supplement before the change is implemented 
we have initiated a program to replace syringes containing our microspheres products because of shelf life limitations on the saline solution contained within the syringes  and reserves we have taken may not be adequate 
we have incurred costs in connection with replacing syringes containing our microspheres products because of shelf life limitations of the saline solution contained within the syringes 
we have informed our customers of these shelf life limitations  and have advised them to contact us regarding product replacement of their syringes 
we believe that all syringes subject to this shelf life limitation have been replaced as of december  however  we may continue to incur costs to replace additional syringes that have not been identified as of december  for the year ended december   we have recognized  in costs of product sales for product replacement as a result of shelf life limitations 
because we rely on a limited number of suppliers  we may experience difficulty in meeting our customers demands for our products in a timely manner or within budget 
we currently purchase key components and services with respect to our microspheres  catheters and guidewires from approximately nine third party vendors including radius  from whom we purchase guidewires for our segway guidewire product  and accellent  from whom we purchase catheters for our embocath infusion catheters product 
we generally do not have long term agreements with any of our suppliers 
our reliance on our suppliers exposes us to risks  including the possibility that one or more of our suppliers could terminate their services at any time without penalty  the potential inability of our suppliers to obtain required components  the potential delays and expenses of seeking alternative sources of supply  reduced control over pricing  quality and timely delivery due to difficulties in switching to alternative suppliers  and the possibility that one or more of our suppliers could fail to satisfy any of the fda s required current good manufacturing practices regulations 
consequently  in the event that our suppliers delay or interrupt the supply of components for any reason  our ability to produce and supply our products could be impaired  which could lead to customer dissatisfaction 
risks relating to our foreign operations if we are unable to meet the operational  legal and financial challenges that we encounter in our international operations  we may not be able to grow our business 
our worldwide manufacturing and european sales operations are currently conducted primarily through our french subsidiary 
furthermore  we currently derive a portion of our revenues from the sale of our microspheres and other products in the european union 
for the years ended december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our revenues were derived from sales of our microspheres and other products in the european union 
we are increasingly subject to a number of challenges which specifically relate to our international business activities 
our international operations may not be successful if we are unable to meet and overcome these challenges  which would limit the growth of our business 
these challenges include failure of local laws to provide the same degree of protection against infringement of our intellectual property  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors  which could slow our growth in international markets  potentially longer sales cycles to sell products  which could slow our revenue growth from international sales  and potentially longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable 
because we translate foreign currency from international sales into us dollars and are required to make foreign currency payments  we may incur losses due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
a significant portion of our business is conducted in the european union euro 
we recognize foreign currency gains or losses arising from our operations in the period incurred 
as a result  currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the currencies in which we do business will cause foreign currency translation gains and losses  which may cause fluctuations in our future operating results 
we do not currently engage in foreign exchange hedging transactions to manage our foreign currency exposure 
risk relating to our stock price because the market price of our stock is highly volatile  investments in our stock could rapidly lose their value and we may incur significant costs from class action litigation 
the market price of our stock is highly volatile 
during and  the price of our common stock ranged from a high of to a low of 
as a result of this volatility  investments in our stock could rapidly lose their value 
in addition  the stock market often experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations  which affect the market price of many medical device companies and which are often unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
when the market price of a stock has been as volatile as our stock price has been  holders of that stock may institute securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock 
if any of our stockholders were to bring a lawsuit of this type against us  even if the lawsuit is without merit  we could incur substantial costs in defending the lawsuit 
the lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments as of december   we did not participate in any derivative financial instruments or other financial and commodity instruments 
however  in the future  we may consider certain financing instruments  including foreign currency forward contracts  or alternative instruments  which may be considered derivative in nature 
primary market risk exposures our primary market risk exposure is in the area of foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our operations in france 
operations in france are denominated in the euro  and as of december   approximately  or  remained outstanding within the inter company trade accounts 
accordingly  a hypothetical percent increase in euro to us dollar conversion rates would result in an approximate  foreign currency market to market change in the fair value of our inter company trade account balance as of december  we have not engaged in formal currency hedging activities to date  but do have a limited natural hedge in that our revenues and expenses in france are primarily denominated in the euro 
we also attempt to minimize exchange rate risk by converting non us currency to non us dollars as often as practicable 
we generally view our investment in foreign subsidiaries operating under a functional currency the euro other than our reporting currency the us dollar as long term 
our investment in foreign subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the other accumulated comprehensive loss component of stockholders equity 
because our foreign currency exchange rate risk is not material  no quantitative tabular disclosure has been provided 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that an increase in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to decrease 
to minimize this risk in the future  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  investment grade asset backed corporate securities  money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
due to the conservative nature of our investments  the relatively short duration of their maturities  our ability to convert some or all of our long term investments to less interest rate sensitive holdings and our general intent to hold most securities until maturity  we believe interest rate risk is mitigated 
as of december   approximately of the  classified  as available for sale marketable securities will mature within one year
