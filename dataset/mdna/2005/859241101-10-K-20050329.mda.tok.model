business sterling construction company  inc sterling or the company owns two subsidiaries i sterling houston holdings  inc  a heavy civil construction company based in houston  texas the construction segment or shh and ii steel city products  inc  a distributor of automotive accessories  non food pet supplies and lawn and garden products based in pittsburgh  pennsylvania the distribution segment or scpi 
further information on the businesses of the company s operating segments is discussed below 
financial information for the segments is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
business strategy the company seeks to increase long term stockholder value by expanding profit opportunities through winning and executing more contracts and larger ones in its core construction business 
this requires the continued investment in a growing staff of professional engineers and construction crews and the addition of capital equipment 
acquisitions are also part of management s growth strategy and acquisition candidates are regularly evaluated 
in general  the company is seeking acquisitions that would be accretive and have management who will continue to direct the operations of the acquired enterprise 
while an acquisition that would expand the scope  either functionally and or geographically  of the current business would be desirable  management has and will continue to consider other transactions that meet the aforementioned financial and management criteria 
the company s tax loss carryforwards are an important corporate asset and the protection and utilization of the losses is expected to assist in increasing shareholder values for the next several years 
stockholder value is measured by increases in shareholders equity and by the appreciation of the value of the outstanding common stock over a period of years 
in addition  the company measures its success by the ability to attract and maintain experienced and capable employees and to maintain high ethical standards 
the construction segment operations shh specializes in municipal and state contracts for the construction and paving of highways  building of bridges  installing water and sewer mains  light rail infrastructure projects and similar activities 

table of contents raw materials the principal raw materials used in shh s business include structural steel  concrete and aggregate 
these and other raw materials and components which are used and are necessary in the construction business are generally available from numerous sources 
factors such as price and availability of transportation for these raw materials may limit supply at some times 
shh does not foresee shortages in these raw materials in the near term that would have a material adverse effect on the business 
seasonality shh s operations can be materially affected by poor weather conditions  so that generally less construction is completed in the winter months 
in particular  significant rainfall can cause construction delays adversely affecting revenues and margins on contracts in progress 
customer base most of shh s revenues are generated in the houston municipal market  which includes the city of houston  the houston metropolitan transit authority and harris county 
see note in addition to its established operations in houston  shh has operations in the dallas fort worth and san antonio markets and undertakes contracts for the state of texas in each of its markets and elsewhere within the state 
shh also occasionally undertakes projects for private developers and corporate customers 
most contracts are subject to a competitive public tender process 
there are no foreign revenues 
the table set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements shows contract revenues generated from shh s largest customers which accounted for more than of revenues in fiscal  and contract backlog at december   shh s backlog of construction contracts totaled million  the largest year end backlog in shh s history  and an increase of compared with december  of this amount  approximately million is scheduled to be completed within fiscal  and approximately million in fiscal and beyond 
shh expects to add further contracts during for construction during the year and in the future 
through mid march  the company announced new contract wins individually exceeding million with an aggregate value of million 
competition the typical public contract selection process is by sealed bid with the lowest bidder winning in a public selection process 
management undertakes a significant due diligence process in preparing each bid 
participants must post bid bonds for up to of the amount bid  and on successful bids must post performance bonds for of the contract amount 
contracts are priced for labor  sub contracting  equipment use and materials against detailed specifications provided by the customer 
shh s competitors include large national and regional construction companies as well as smaller contractors 
management is unable to determine the relative size of most competitors  which are privately owned  but believes that shh is one of the larger participants in its marketplace  and the largest contractor in houston that is engaged in municipal civil construction work 
shh s size relative to its many smaller competitors in the municipal construction market gives it several advantages  including greater flexibility to manage its backlog so as to maximize its manpower and equipment 
table of contents resources  and the cost effective purchasing of materials  insurance and bonds 
since shh owns and maintains most of the equipment required for its contracts and has the experienced manpower to handle many types of municipal civil construction  it is able to bid competitively on many categories of contracts  especially complex multi task projects 
in its successful effort to penetrate the state highway market  where most competitors are large  regional contractors  and individual contracts tend to be larger than the company s municipal work and involve many specialized skills  shh acquired the kinsel heavy highway construction business kinsel in september by fiscal state highway work had come to represent of construction segment revenues  compared with and in fiscal and  respectively 
regulation management does not anticipate that existing or known pending environmental legislation or other regulations will require major capital expenditures or will adversely affect its operations 
however  in the last two years  environmental issues have adversely impacted the rate at which certain highway contracts have been let in the houston market 
employees at december   shh employed approximately persons  of whom were employed in the headquarters in houston 
most of the others are field personnel 
no shh employees are represented by a labor union 
senior shh executives  including patrick t 
manning also chief executive officer of sterling and joseph p 
harper  sr 
also president of sterling have many years of service with shh and are employed under long term contracts  which were renewed during fiscal shh s business is dependent upon a readily available workforce of both field and supervisory personnel 
shh does not anticipate any shortage of labor in the near term  but has no assurance that it will be able to continue to attract sufficient numbers of new employees to support its growth in the future 
the distribution segment operations since its founding in scpi has distributed automotive accessories  now including functional and decorative car and truck accessories  car care products  chemicals and car repair and maintenance items 
in fiscal  scpi expanded its merchandise selection to include non food pet supplies and in fiscal added lawn and garden products 
sales in fiscal of pet supplies and lawn and garden products represented approximately and  respectively  of scpi s total sales 
scpi s automotive and pet distribution operations are conducted from leased facilities in mckeesport  pennsylvania and its lawn and garden operations are conducted from leased facilities in glassport  pennsylvania 
many of scpi s largest customers transmit their own orders directly to scpi s warehouse  nevertheless  scpi continues to provide personal service to many customers  which involves visits by its sales personnel to customers stores to count and re order merchandise 
since most orders are generated electronically and are shipped within a few days of receipt  the size of scpi s order backlog is not relevant to an understanding of the business 
shipments are either made directly to each of the customers stores or are packed for onward shipment to stores via the retailers distribution centers 
scpi also provides price ticketing and associated services to those of its customers that request such services 
sources of supply scpi acquires its merchandise from a large number of suppliers  the largest of which accounted for of its purchases for fiscal many of the products sold by scpi carry nationally advertised brand names  but because of the diversity and number of suppliers and products carried  the business is not generally dependent on the continued availability of individual products or continued dealings with existing supply sources 
from time to time  
table of contents market or seasonal conditions may affect the availability of certain merchandise  but not to the extent that the company believes would materially impact its business 
steel city products generally carries in inventory only those products that its customers have identified as necessary for their own merchandising needs and does not acquire significant quantities of other merchandise 
seasonality scpi s automotive and lawn and garden businesses are seasonal  being slowest in the early winter months than at other times of the year 
in anticipation of higher sales volume in the spring and summer  scpi carries higher inventories of these products beginning in the winter months 
as is customary in the automotive aftermarket and in the lawn and garden products business  some suppliers allow extended payment terms to scpi for such inventory build ups 
scpi s pet supply business is less subject to seasonality  but usually experiences increased sales in the fourth quarter of the year 
scpi s needs for working capital are affected by these seasonal fluctuations and other factors see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
customer base scpi s customers include supermarket chains  drug stores  general merchandise retail chains  automotive specialty stores  hardware stores  variety stores  some smaller garden centers and other automotive accessory distributors 
most customers are based in the northeastern united states  although stores operated by some customers are located outside of that area  and since scpi has been selling to the west coast distribution facility of one of its major customers see note 
there are no foreign sales 
scpi s customers are continually affected by changes in the retail environment  including the competitive pressures facing regional mass merchandisers and the growing influence of national automotive and pet specialty chains 
these have led to fluctuations in the level of business that scpi enjoys with individual customers 
some customers have changed their buying practices to acquire certain merchandise direct from manufacturers rather than through distributors such as scpi 
in its efforts to offset these trends  scpi has in recent years added new customers  especially in the supermarket and drug store sectors  has expanded its product offerings to certain customers  has enlarged the territory that it serves and has introduced new categories of products 
management believes that these efforts have resulted in a more diverse and financially secure customer base 
none of scpi s business is based on government contracts and there are no long term sales contracts with any customers 
competition the distribution business for automotive parts and accessories  non food pet supplies and lawn and garden products is highly competitive  with several similar companies operating in scpi s market place  and many of scpi s suppliers also offering their products directly to retailers 
management is unable to quantify scpi s relative size in relation to its competitors  but believes it is one of the largest independent distributors of automotive accessories in the northeastern united states 
in recent years  a number of significant competitors of scpi have gone out of business and some of scpi s customers have chosen to purchase some products directly from manufacturers 
scpi competes on the basis of its management s merchandise expertise  the breadth of merchandise offered  price  levels of service  order fill rates and order turnaround times 
management believes that scpi s long history  good reputation  experienced management  product selection  pricing  and traditionally high service levels and order fill rates  enable it to compete favorably with other distributors and direct sales by manufacturers 

table of contents regulation scpi s management does not anticipate that existing or known pending environmental legislation or other regulations will require major capital expenditures or will adversely affect its operations 
employees scpi employs approximately persons  of which about are employed in the headquarters office and distribution facility in mckeesport and the glassport distribution facility

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview as discussed in item business above  the company operates primarily as a heavy civil construction company based in houston  texas under the trade name texas sterling construction 
the company s distribution business is conducted in pittsburgh  pennsylvania under the name steel city products 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management s estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience  however  actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain of the company s accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include the recognition of revenue and earnings from construction contracts and the valuation of long term assets 
management evaluates all of its estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
revenue recognition the company uses the percentage of completion accounting method for construction contracts in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenue and earnings on construction contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method in the ratio of costs incurred to estimated final costs 
provisions are recognized in the statement of income for the full amount of estimated losses on uncompleted contracts whenever evidence indicates that the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue 
factors that can contribute to changes in estimates of contract profitability include  without limitation  site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid to the extent that contract remedies are unavailable  the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project  the availability and proximity of materials  the accuracy of the original bid  inclement weather and timing and coordination issues inherent in all projects  including design build 
contract cost consists of direct costs on contracts  including labor and materials  subcontractor costs  direct overhead and equipment expense primarily depreciation  fuel  maintenance and repairs 
depreciation is provided using straight line methods for construction equipment 
contract cost is recorded as incurred and revisions in contract revenue and cost estimates are reflected in the accounting period when known 
if the company projects a loss on a project the estimated loss is immediately recognized 
claims for additional contract revenue are recognized if it is probable that the claim will result in additional revenue and the amount can be reliably estimated 
the foregoing as well as weather  stage of completion and mix of contracts at different margins may cause fluctuations in gross profit achieved in different accounting periods and these fluctuations may be significant 
a significant portion of the construction segment s revenues is derived from contracts that are fixed unit price under which the company is committed to provide materials or services required by a project at fixed unit prices for example  dollars per cubic yard of concrete or per cubic yards of earth excavated 
all government contracts and many of the company s other contracts provide for termination of the contract for the convenience of the party contracting with the company  with provisions to pay the company for work performed through the date of termination 
the construction industry is highly competitive and lacks firms with dominant market power 
the majority of the company s business involves construction contracts obtained through competitive bidding 
the volume and profitability of the company s construction work depends to a significant extent upon the general state of the economy of texas  especially in the houston area  the volume of work available to contractors and competitors 
table of contents levels of backlog 
the company s construction operations could be adversely affected by labor stoppages or shortages  adverse weather conditions  economic downturns  shortages of supplies or government actions 
valuation of long term assets long lived assets  which include property  equipment and acquired identifiable intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of useful asset lives and future cash flows 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by management and this could have a material effect on operating results and financial position 
additionally  the company had goodwill with a value of approximately million at december   which must be reviewed for impairment at least annually in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas 
the impairment testing required by sfas requires considerable judgment and there can be no assurance that an impairment charge will not be required in the future 
the company completed its annual impairment review for goodwill effective october  and it did not reveal impairment of goodwill 
deferred taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
as a result of this review and the related shh acquisition  in fiscal the company reduced the valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to the estimated utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards 
due to the operating profitability of the company and the expiration of loss carryforwards  in fiscal  and  the valuation allowance was reduced by million  million and million  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources at shh  the level of working capital varies principally as a result of changes in the levels of cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings  of billings in excess of cost and estimated earnings and levels of retention and the timeliness of payment of receivables by its customers 
shh s cash requirements are also impacted by its needs for capital equipment  which have generally been financed from cash flow or from borrowings under its line of credit 
at scpi  the level of working capital varies primarily with the amounts of inventory carried  which can change seasonally  the size and timeliness of payment of receivables due from customers and the amount of credit extended by suppliers 
scpi s working capital needs not financed by suppliers have been financed from cash flow and borrowings  principally under its line of credit 
contractual obligations fixed  noncancelable obligations of the company at december  are as follows in thousands payments due by period less than one three four five more than total one year years years five years debt capital leases operating leases related party notes other long term liabilities in connection with construction contracts in backlog and in progress  the construction segment generally has back to back agreements to assure the supply of required materials  services and sub contracting

a change in control of sterling exceeding in any three year period may lead to the loss of the majority of the tax benefits 
in order to reduce the likelihood of such a change of control occurring  sterling s certificate of incorporation includes restrictions on the registration of transfers of stock resulting in  or increasing  individual holdings exceeding of sterling s common stock 
shareholdings over resulting from the sterling transaction  and changes thereto resulting from the shares issued pursuant to the exercise of the put  were approved by the company s board following receipt of required opinions that these did not adversely affect the availability of the tax benefits 
since the regulations governing the tax benefits are highly complex and may be changed from time to time  and since sterling s attempts to reduce the likelihood of a change of control occurring may not be successful  management is unable to determine the likelihood of the continued availability of the tax benefits 
however  management believes that the tax benefits are currently available in full and intends to take all appropriate steps to help ensure that they remain available 
should the tax benefits become unavailable to sterling  most of its future income and that of any consolidated affiliate would not be shielded from federal taxation  thus reducing funds otherwise available for corporate purposes see note to the consolidated financial statements
