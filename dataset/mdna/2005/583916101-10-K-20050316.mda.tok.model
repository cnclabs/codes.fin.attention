overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and potential commercialization of fully human antibody based therapeutic products 
we believe that our ultimab human antibody development system enables us to rapidly create and develop such products for a wide range of diseases  including cancer  inflammation  autoimmune disorders and other life threatening and debilitating diseases 
currently  antibody products generated from our ultimab human antibody development system are in human clinical trials 
these antibodies are designed to treat a wide range of diseases  such as cancer  rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory  autoimmune and infectious diseases 
the most advanced of these products is mdx currently in phase iii  phase ii and phase i clinical trials  which we are developing jointly with bristol myers squibb company  or bms  for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and other cancers 
four of these antibody products are fully owned by medarex and its affiliates mdx for lymphomas phase ii clinical trial  mdx for prostate cancer phase ii clinical trial  mdx for cancer phase i ii clinical trial and mdx for genitourinary and breast cancers phase i clinical trial 
we are also developing mdx phase i clinical trial jointly with the massachusetts biologic laboratories for the treatment of clostridium difficile associated diarrhea 
another antibody  mdx phase i ii clinical trial  is being jointly developed with genmab a s for autoimmune disease  and three are being developed separately by genmab humax cd phase ii clinical trials for t cell lymphomas  humax egfr phase i ii clinical trial for head and neck cancer and humax cd phase i ii clinical trial for lymphomas 
genmab and amgen  inc are developing amg phase ii clinical trial for rheumatoid arthritis 
additionally  other licensing partners  including novartis pharma ag  eli lilly and company  and centocor  inc a subsidiary of johnson johnson  are developing a total of ten antibody products  for inflammatory and or autoimmune diseases and cancer  that are currently in early clinical trials 
human genome sciences  inc has also announced the initiation of a phase i trial of one anticancer antibody product developed pursuant to a licensing agreement with our partner kirin brewery co  ltd 
we and our partners also have a number of ultimab product candidates in preclinical development 
the preceding information regarding the clinical status of antibody products is based on our and our partners public disclosure and other publicly available information 
our revenue is principally derived from licensing our fully human antibody technology to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
the terms of these license agreements typically include potential license fees and a series of potential milestone payments commencing upon the initiation of clinical trials and continuing through commercialization 
these payments may total million to million per product if the antibody receives approval from the us food and drug administration  or fda  and equivalent foreign agencies 
in general  we are also entitled to receive royalties on product sales 
additional revenue may be earned from the sales to  and in some cases  the manufacturing of antibodies for  our partners  as well as from government grants 
our most significant costs on an annual basis are research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses 
research and development expenses represent those costs that support the advancement of our product pipeline and primarily consist of personnel costs  facilities including depreciation  research and laboratory supplies  funding of outside research  license and technology access fees  expenses related to antibody manufacturing and clinical trial expenses 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses for executive  finance  legal and administrative personnel  professional fees and other general corporate expenses 
we may be required to add personnel in the future and incur additional costs as we expand our business activities 
we have a history of operating losses and may not achieve profitability 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
over the next several years  we expect to incur substantial expenses as we continue to identify  develop and manufacture our potential products  invest in research  move forward with our product development and prepare to commercialize our product s 
our commitment of resources to research and the continued development and potential commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial additional funds 
our operating expenses may also increase as we invest in research or acquire additional technologies  as additional potential product candidates are selected for clinical development and as some of our earlier stage product candidates move into later stage clinical development 
in addition  we may incur significant milestone payment obligations as our products progress towards commercialization 
in the absence of substantial revenues from new corporate collaborations or other sources  we will incur substantial operating losses and may be required to raise additional funds through debt or equity financings or delay  reduce or eliminate certain of our research and development programs 
critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could materially change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us  in that they are important to the portrayal of our financial statements and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we receive payments from our customers and partners for the sale of antibodies  for licenses to our proprietary technology  for product development services and from the achievement of product development milestones 
these payments are generally non refundable and are reported as deferred revenue until they are recognizable as revenue 
we follow the following principles in recognizing revenue we sell antibodies primarily to partners in the united states and overseas 
revenue from these sales is recognized when the antibodies are shipped 
we receive research fees from the licensing of our proprietary technologies for research and development performed by our customers and partners 
revenue from these research fees is recognized generally over the term of the respective license period beginning only after both the license period has begun and the technology has been delivered 
we receive fees for product development services including manufacturing we perform for our customers and partners 
these fees are recognized ratably over the entire period during which the services are performed 
revenue from milestone payments is recognized when each milestone is achieved and when collectibility of such milestone payment is assured 
milestone payments are triggered either by the results of our research efforts or by the efforts of our partners and include such events as submission of an investigational new drug application  or ind  commencement of phase i  ii or iii clinical trials  submission of a biologic license application  or bla  and approval of a product 
milestone payments are substantially at risk at the inception of an agreement 
upon achievement of a milestone event  we have no future performance obligations relating to that event 
revenue arrangements that include multiple deliverables  are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables meet certain criteria  including whether the fair value of the delivered items can be determined and whether there is evidence of fair value of the undelivered items 
in addition  the consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are considered separately for each of the separate units of accounting 
investments our investment policy calls for investments in fixed income high grade securities such as us corporate debt securities  us treasury obligations and money market funds for which we believe there is not a significant risk of loss 
our primary objectives for our investment portfolio are liquidity and safety of principal 
investments are made to achieve the highest rate of return consistent with these two objectives 
however  in the course of our business  we have made and may continue to make investments in companies both public and private as part of our strategic collaborations 
investments in companies whose securities are publicly traded other than genmab are classified as marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheets 
the fair market value of investments in our partners whose securities are publicly traded represented approximately of total marketable securities as of december  and approximately of total marketable securities as of december  under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  our marketable securities are classified as available for sale securities and are carried at fair value 
marketable securities will include those securities of debt and publicly traded equity securities accounted for under the cost method 
these securities trade on listed exchanges  therefore  fair value is readily available 
these securities are also subject to an impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
under our accounting policy  a decline in the value of our investments is deemed to be other than temporary and such investments are generally considered to be impaired if their value is less than our cost basis for more than six months  or some other applicable period in light of the facts and circumstances surrounding the investments 
in addition  in connection with our collaborative partnering business  we sometimes make strategic investments in the securities of companies that are privately held 
investments in our partners whose equity is not publicly traded are classified in separate line items in our consolidated balance sheet entitled investments in idm and investments in  and advances to  other partners and were approximately million as of december  these securities are carried at original investment cost and adjusted for other than temporary impairment charges  if any 
because these securities are not listed on a financial exchange  the value of these investments is inherently more difficult to estimate than investments in public companies 
we value these investments by using information acquired from industry trends  the management of these companies  financial statements  and other external sources 
specifically  our determination of any potential impairment of the value of privately held securities includes an analysis of the following for each company on a periodic basis review of interim and year end financial statements  cash position and overall rate of cash used to support operations  the progress and development of technology and product platform  the per share value of subsequent financings and potential strategic alternatives 
based on the information acquired through these sources  we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or adverse changes in financial condition and or operating results of the companies in which we invest that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value may also require an impairment charge in the future 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following a significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in the manner of our use of the acquired asset or the strategy for our overall business  and or a significant negative industry or economic trend 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets or long lived assets are not recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets that have not been previously recorded 
acquired in process technology in process technology expense for significant technology acquisitions is determined based on an analysis using risk adjusted cash flows expected to be generated by products that may result from in process technologies which have been acquired 
this analysis includes forecasting future cash flows that are expected to result from the progress made on each in process project prior to the acquisition date 
cash flows are estimated by first forecasting  on a product by product basis  net revenues expected from the sales of the first generation of each in process project and risk adjusting these revenues to reflect the probability of advancing to the next stage of the fda approval process 
the forecast data in the analysis is based on internal product level forecast information maintained by us in the ordinary course of business 
the inputs used in analyzing in process technology is based on assumptions  which we believe to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
these assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
appropriate operating expenses are deducted from forecasted net revenues on a product by product basis to establish a forecast of net returns on the completed portion of the in process technology 
finally  net returns are discounted to a present value using discount rates that incorporate the weighted average cost of capital relative to the biotech industry and us as well as product specific risks associated with the acquired in process research and development products 
the product specific risk factors include the product s phase of development  type of product candidate under development  likelihood of regulatory approval  manufacturing process capability  scientific rationale  preclinical safety and efficacy data  target product profile  and development plan 
in addition to the product specific risk factors  a discount rate is used for the valuation  which represents a considerable risk premium to our weighted average cost of capital 
the valuations used to estimate in process technology require us to use significant estimates and assumptions that if changed  may result in a different valuation for in process technology 
results of operations years ended december   and contract and license revenues contract and license revenues totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
contract and license revenues for decreased by million or as compared to this decrease relates principally to a decrease in revenue from immuno design molecules  sa  or idm  of million as a result of the completion of the recognition of revenue associated with the transfer of technology to idm in july  as well as a decrease in revenue of million from eli lilly and company 
contract and license revenues for increased by million or as compared to this increase relates principally to approximately million of revenue recognized from our collaboration agreement with pfizer  inc which was executed in september and approximately million of revenue from the national institutes of health in accordance with a grant we received in because contract and license revenues depend to a large extent on the product development efforts of our partners and licensees  our year to year contract and license revenues can fluctuate significantly and are inherently difficult to predict 
sales  contract and license revenues from genmab sales  contract and license revenues from genmab a s were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
sales  contract and license revenues from genmab for decreased by million or as compared to in there were sales of mdx cd and mdx totaling million in order to support genmab s clinical trials 
there were no sales of such material to genmab in or the decrease was offset  in part  by increased contract and license revenues related principally to an increased number of research licenses and antibody exclusive licenses requested by and granted to genmab 
sales  contract and license revenues from genmab for decreased by million or as compared to this decrease relates principally to fewer research licenses and antibody exclusive licenses requested by and granted to genmab 
cost of sales cost of sales were million  thousand and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cost of sales in decreased by million  as compared to the decrease is the result of no sales of mdx cd and mdx to genmab in as discussed above 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for our products in development were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
research and development expenses in increased by million  or as compared to and research and development expenses in increased by million  or as compared to historically  due to the relatively small number of our products in clinical trials  we have not accounted for our research and development expenses on a project by project basis and  therefore  we do not provide a breakdown of such historical information in that format 
we have  historically  tracked our costs in the categories discussed below  namely  research and product development and by the types of costs as outlined below 
our research costs consist of costs associated with the breeding  care and continued development of our humab mouse and km mouse  as well as costs associated with research and testing of our product candidates prior to reaching the preclinical stage 
such research costs primarily include personnel costs  facilities including depreciation  research supplies  funding of outside research and license and technology access fees 
our product development costs consist of costs of preclinical development including manufacturing and conducting and administering clinical trials 
such product development costs also include personnel costs  facilities including depreciation  supply expense related to antibody manufacturing and clinical trial expenses 
the following table sets forth a breakdown of our research and development expenses by those associated with research and those associated with product development for the periods indicated 
year ended december  research product development total research costs research costs in increased by million  or as compared to research costs in increased by million  or as compared to the increases in research costs primarily relate to the following 
personnel costs in were million  an increase of million or as compared to personnel costs in were million  an increase of million or as compared to the increased personnel costs are primarily attributable to staff needed to support higher levels of new product development opportunities  the continued development of our ultimab system  and the performance of contract services for our collaborative partners 
personnel costs include primarily salary  benefits  payroll taxes and recruiting costs 
we expect personnel costs to continue to increase as we continue to increase our research activities 
an million expense representing a liability to gilead sciences  inc for the reduction of future royalty obligations relating to certain intellectual property rights regarding anti ctla product candidates in for which no comparable payments were made in and the total consideration of million is being paid to gilead in eight equal quarterly installments 
the first two of these payments were made in as of december   approximately million six installments remained due to gilead under this obligation see further discussion under the section herein entitled other liquidity matters 
facility costs in were million  an increase of million or as compared to facility costs in were million  an increase of million or as compared to the increase in facility costs primarily relates to the substantial investments made in our research facilities in recent years 
as a result  depreciation  utilities  maintenance  property taxes and related expenses increased for  as compared to  and for  as compared to we expect to incur increased facility costs as a result of continued capital expansion  renovations and replacements 
license and technology access fees in were million  a decrease of million or as compared to license and technology access fees in were million  an increase of million or as compared to these costs represent fees paid to certain partners and research organizations in connection with certain of our collaboration and license agreements 
included in the costs are payments to diadexus  inc  pharma pacific pty ltd 
and kirin brewery co  ltd  or kirin  for licenses to certain technologies 
we expect license fees  including funds paid to certain partners  to increase in the future 
product development costs product development costs in increased by million  or as compared to product development costs increased by million in  or as compared to the increases in product development costs primarily relate to the following contract manufacturing costs in were million  an increase of million or as compared to contract manufacturing costs in were million  an increase of million or as compared to the increase in third party contract manufacturing costs primarily represents production and packaging expenses for a phase iii pivotal trial of mdx in combination with mdx  which began in the third quarter of and certain mdx manufacturing costs 
we expect costs to third party manufacturers will increase in the future in order to support the advancement of our clinical pipeline 
personnel costs in were million  an increase of million or as compared to personnel costs in were million  an increase of million or as compared to the increased personnel costs are a result of the increased staff needed to support more extensive clinical trial activities primarily for mdx personnel costs primarily include salary  benefits  payroll taxes and recruiting costs 
we expect personnel costs to continue to increase as we continue to increase our product development activities and progress our products through clinical trials 
facility costs in were million  an increase of million or as compared to facility costs in were million  an increase of million or as compared to the increase in facility costs primarily relates to the substantial investments made in our product development facilities in recent years 
as a result  depreciation  utilities  maintenance  property taxes and related expenses increased for each of and  as compared to prior year periods 
we expect to continue to incur increased facility costs as a result of continued capital expansion  renovations and replacements 
supply costs in were million  a decrease of million or as compared to in we manufactured larger quantities of material for phase i and phase ii clinical trials for ourselves and our partners resulting in a significant increase in supply costs 
supply costs in were million  a decrease of million or as compared to in we completed a change to our method of production which resulted in comparatively lower supply costs in included in these costs are materials and small equipment associated with the manufacture of material for clinical trials 
we expect these costs to increase as we continue to expand our product development efforts and increase our clinical trial activities 
clinical research fees in were million  an increase of million or as compared to primarily as a result of an increase in the number of ongoing clinical trials particularly for mdx and mdx clinical research fees in were also million  representing the conclusion of certain phase ii clinical trials for mdx offset by the initiation of the phase iii clinical trial for mdx in combination with mdx which began in the third quarter of clinical research fees include clinical investigator site fees  external trial monitoring costs and data accumulation costs 
we expect expenses related to clinical trials to increase in the future as we continue to develop our therapeutic product pipeline 
we expect product development costs to increase in the future as more of our products enter clinical trials 
in addition  we may be obligated to make milestone payments on certain of our products as they progress through the clinical trial process 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more 
the length of time varies according to the type  complexity and intended use of the product candidate 
we estimate that clinical trials of the type we generally conduct are typically completed over the following periods clinical phase estimated completion period phase i years phase ii years phase iii years the duration and cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a particular project as a result of  among other things  the following factors the length of time required to recruit qualified patients for clinical trials  the duration of patient dosing and follow up in light of trial results  the number of clinical sites required for trials  and the number of patients that ultimately participate 
we continue to explore new collaborative arrangements that may affect future spending for research and development 
as part of our partnering strategy  a significant portion of the research and development expenses incurred in connection with products using our technology is expected to be borne by our partners 
we believe this allows us to participate in the research and development of substantially more potential product candidates than we could develop on our own if we bore the entire cost of development 
products using our technology are currently in various stages of development from preclinical to phase iii 
the successful development of these product candidates is dependent on many factors  including among other things  the efforts of our partners  unforeseen delays in  or expenditures relating to  preclinical development  clinical testing  manufacturing or regulatory approval  failure to receive market acceptance  the emergence of competitive products and the inability to produce or market our products due to third party proprietary rights 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include compensation  professional services  consulting  travel and facilities including depreciation and other expenses related to legal  business development  finance  information systems and investor relations 
general and administrative expenses totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million in  or as compared to the decrease was generally attributable to a reduction in legal fees of million primarily as a result of the completion of the negotiation and execution of our collaboration and license agreement with kirin in  and decreased consulting fees of million  partially offset by higher personnel costs of million 
general and administrative expenses increased by million in  or as compared to the increase is primarily attributable to increased personnel costs of million  and increased legal fees of million primarily as a result of the completion of the negotiation and execution of a series of agreements with pfizer and our collaboration and license agreement with bms in general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in the future as our products are developed and we expand our business activities 
write off of facility costs write off of facility costs in relates to a determination we made to delay indefinitely the planned construction of a large scale manufacturing facility at our bloomsbury  new jersey  location and to pursue late stage clinical and commercial supply agreements with third party manufacturers with available capacity to meet our current internal production timetables 
as a result of this decision  we recorded a charge of million in  representing the write off of design  engineering and other pre construction costs 
we believe that our existing facility in annandale  new jersey  is adequate for the production of materials for clinical trials of our products and for providing support we offer our partners in connection with our human antibody technology in the near term 
in september  we entered into a clinical supply agreement with lonza group ltd 
with respect to mdx and mdx  and  together with our partner bms  we are pursuing ongoing discussions with respect to terms of a commercial supply agreement for mdx acquisition of in process technology acquisition of in process technology for the year ended december   related to our acquisition of certain assets including certain preclinical product candidates and programs related to the research and development of therapeutic products for the treatment of autoimmune disorders  cancer and infectious diseases of corixa corporation in may the total cost of the acquisition including transaction costs  discussed more fully under the section herein entitled liquidity and capital resources  was million 
based upon an independent third party valuation  in  million of the cost of the acquisition was charged to operations as acquisition of in process technology 
acquisition of in process technology for the year ended december  related to an amended and restated license agreement with kyowa hakko kogyo co 
ltd  or the kyowa license  that we entered into during the fourth quarter of under the terms of the kyowa license we received certain intellectual property rights relating to the development and commercialization of our ultra potent toxin technology 
the kyowa license was the result of a renegotiation of a pre existing license agreement with respect to ultra potent toxin technology between kyowa and corixa  whose license agreement we acquired as part of the may asset acquisition 
upon the execution of the kyowa license  we paid kyowa a total of million and also made a final payment to corixa in the amount of million 
acquisition of in process technology for the year ended december  related to our acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock not already owned by us of ability biomedical corporation  a privately held canadian biotechnology company  in august the total cost of the acquisition including transaction costs  discussed more fully under the section herein entitled liquidity and capital resources  was million  of which approximately million of in process research and development was determined not to be technologically feasible and had no alternative future uses at the time of acquisition  and  as a result  was charged to operations as acquisition of in process technology during equity in net loss of affiliate equity in net loss of affiliate represents our share of genmab s net loss for the years ended december   and genmab is an affiliated company and is accounted for using the equity method of accounting see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the recognition of our share of genmab s net losses reduces the carrying value  or basis  of our investment in genmab 
we expect that during the first quarter of the remaining basis of our investment in genmab will be reduced to zero and  accordingly  recognition of our share of genmab s net losses will be suspended 
equity in net loss of affiliate was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
equity in net loss of affiliate in decreased by million or as compared to included in equity in net loss of affiliate for is in an impairment loss on our investment in genmab of million resulting from an approximate decrease in the market value of genmab s stock following genmab s september   press release in which it announced that its humax cd product  a fully human antibody that targets cd receptors on cells known as t cells was found not to be effective in combination with methotrexate in a phase ii study of patients with active rheumatoid arthritis 
we recorded the million impairment charge in the third quarter of as a result of the decrease in the market price of the genmab stock  which was deemed to be other than temporary at the time 
if we deem our investment in genmab to be further impaired at the end of any future period  we may incur an additional impairment charge on this investment 
excluding the impact of the impairment in  equity in net loss of affiliate would have decreased by million or as compared to this decrease was the result of a decrease in genmab s net loss for  primarily as a result of the recognition of million of milestone revenue by genmab during on july   genmab completed a private placement of million shares of its stock 
as a result of this private placement  our ownership percentage of genmab was reduced from approximately to 
the difference between our proportionate share of the additional equity raised was approximately million and was accounted for in accordance with apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investment in common stock  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 accounting for sales of stock by a subsidiary increasing our investment in genmab and capital in excess of par value 
equity in net loss of affiliate in increased by million or as compared to this increase reflects an increase in genmab s net loss as a result of its expanded research and development efforts offset  in part  by a reduction in our ownership percentage  resulting from the private placement  and therefore a reduction of our share of genmab s net loss for the second half of interest and dividend income interest and dividend income consists primarily of interest earned from our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
interest and dividend income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest and dividend income in decreased by million  or as compared to the decrease reflects lower returns on our investment portfolio and a reduction in the size of our average cash balances invested  which  on average  were also lower during the period 
interest and dividend income in decreased by million  or as compared to this decrease primarily relates to lower returns on our investment portfolio as well as increased amortization of premiums on debt securities 
we anticipate lower interest and dividend income in the future as we continue to fund our operations and capital expenditures from our cash reserves 
impairment loss on investments in partners in the course of our business we may make investments in companies both public and private as part of strategic collaborations 
we recorded impairment charges of million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively related to investments in certain of our partners other than genmab whose securities are publicly traded 
the impairment charge was the result of certain investments trading below their original cost basis for more than six months 
the impairment charge was the result of losses on one of these investments which were considered to be other than temporary 
if we deem these investments to be further impaired at the end of any future period  we may incur additional impairment charges on these investments 
in addition  we have investments in several partners whose securities are not publicly traded 
because these securities are not publicly traded  the value of these investments is inherently more difficult to estimate than investments in publicly traded companies 
we recorded impairment charges of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  related to investments in certain of our partners whose securities are not publicly traded 
the impairment charge is primarily comprised of a million impairment related to our investment in idm 
the amount of the idm impairment charge was calculated as the difference between the per share price received by idm in a december private placement of its equity securities and our cost basis 
if we deem these investments to be further impaired at the end of any future period  we may incur additional impairment charges on these investments 
additional payments receipts related to asset acquisitions additional payments receipts related to asset acquisition of million  thousand and thousand for the years ended december   and  respectively  represent net additional purchase payments receipts to northwest biotherapeutics  millennium pharmaceuticals and corixa in  to northwest biotherapeutics in and to gilead  pharma pacific and ability biomedical shareholders in pursuant to the terms of our agreements with these companies  under certain circumstances we were required to pay or to receive an amount equal to the difference between the proceeds received by these companies from the sale of any shares of our common stock delivered as payment of any installment of the purchase price of the assets and the total amount of the purchase price installment due under the agreements 
interest expense interest expense was primarily related to interest and amortization of issuance costs on our convertible subordinated notes issued in june  or the notes  our convertible senior notes issued in july  or the notes  and our senior subordinated notes issued in may  or the notes 
interest expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest expense in increased by million  or as compared to reflecting the addition of approximately five months of accrued interest on our notes 
interest expense in increased by million  or as compared to the increase reflects a full year of interest expense on our notes and the addition of approximately seven months of interest expense on our notes  offset  in part  by a decrease in interest expense resulting from the redemption  repurchase and cancellation of the notes in june and july of the notes are due in may and interest is payable semi annually on may and november of each year 
we expect interest expense to decrease in the future as a result of the redemption  repurchase and cancellation of the notes and the january conversion of our notes see further explanation under the section entitled other liquidity matters 
debt conversion expense debt conversion expense of million for the year ended december  related to the make whole payment associated with the december decision calling for the redemption of our notes 
such amount was accrued as of december  and was paid in january see further information under the section entitled cash provided by financing activities 
there were no comparable charges for the years ended december  and net loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with a private placement of million of our notes see further discussion under the section entitled liquidity and capital resources we repurchased and redeemed million in aggregate principal amount of our notes for cancellation 
as a result of this repurchase and cancellation we recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of approximately million for the year ended december  in january  we and certain holders of our notes completed an exchange and cancellation of million in aggregate principal amount of the notes  for the issuance of million in aggregate principal of a new series of notes and in connection therewith  we recorded a gain of approximately million for we calculated the gain in accordance with eitf  debtor s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments 
eitf requires that the gain on the early extinguishment of debt be computed using the fair value of the newly issued convertible debt which  at the time of the debt exchange  was trading at a premium to the principal amount of the notes 
we classified the premium associated with the newly issued notes of approximately million as capital in excess of par value in accordance with apb  accounting for convertible debt and debt issued with stock purchase warrants 
provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes of million  million and thousand for the years ended december   and  respectively  relates primarily to the new jersey alternative minimum tax assessment which became effective in cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the year ended december  was million 
effective january   we changed our method of accounting for asset retirement obligations in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
previously  we were not required to recognize amounts related to asset retirement obligations 
under sfas no 
 we now recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
the adoption of sfas no 
resulted in an increase in net property  buildings and equipment of approximately million  recognition of an asset retirement obligation liability of approximately million and a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources we require cash to fund our operations  to make capital expenditures and strategic investments  and to pay debt service on our convertible notes 
since inception  we have financed our operations through the sale of our securities in public and private placements  sales of our products for research purposes  development and manufacturing services  technology transfer and license fees and milestone payments 
we expect to continue to fund our cash requirements from these sources in the future 
in   and  we received net proceeds of million from sales of our equity and debt securities 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities

in july  we entered into an amendment to a collaboration and license agreement with gilead  referred to herein as the gilead amendment 
under the terms of the gilead amendment  we agreed to pay gilead a total of million in eight equal quarterly installments of million  payable at our election  in cash  registered shares of our common stock or a combination thereof  in exchange for i a reduction of certain future royalty payment obligations payable by us to gilead  and ii an expansion of the scope of certain licenses from gilead to us relating to certain intellectual property rights regarding anti ctla products

the second payment was made on october  in cash 
the third payment was made on january  in cash 
the five remaining payments will be made on a quarterly basis  commencing on april  and ending on april  if we decide to make a quarterly installment payment in shares of our common stock  the number of shares of common stock subject to issuance for any installment will be determined by dividing x million less any cash paid in connection with the installment by y the average of the closing sales prices of our common stock for each of the trading days during the five trading day period ending on and including the trading day that is two trading days immediately prior to the applicable date of issuance as publicly reported by nasdaq

if such sale proceeds exceed million less any cash paid in connection with such installment  gilead must pay us of any such excess in cash 
in the event that  during any such day period  gilead does not sell all of the shares of our common stock comprising the installment  there will be no such adjustment

upon achievement of certain development milestones with respect to our anti ip antibody program  but no later than september   we may be required to pay the former shareholders of ability biomedical an additional amount of approximately million in cash and or common stock subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in lieu of such additional payment  we also have the option to revert to the original joint collaboration agreement with the former shareholders of ability biomedical whereby each party would be responsible for of the costs associated with the anti ip antibody 
in september  we entered into a series of agreements with pfizer 
the first agreement amended our existing collaborative research and license and royalty agreements with pfizer to provide for the discovery and development of up to antibody products over ten years 
the second and third agreements were a sublicense from us to pfizer and a cross license of certain patents and patent applications  in each case solely relating to our respective anti ctla antibody programs 
the fourth agreement was a stock purchase agreement also related to the anti ctla programs 
pursuant to certain of these agreements  pfizer made a total initial cash payment to us of million and purchased  shares of our common stock at a purchase price equal to per share for an aggregate purchase price of million 
these shares were issued in a private placement and the per share price represented a premium to market price at the time we entered into the collaboration 
in november  we announced a collaboration and co promotion agreement and a related securities purchase agreement with bms 
this collaboration became effective in january under the terms of the collaboration  we and bms have each granted the other certain intellectual property licenses and product rights on a worldwide basis in order to enable us to collaborate in research and development of certain therapeutic antibody based products for the treatment of cancer and other diseases  and  in the event that further development work is successful  to commercialize any resulting products 
in particular  the collaboration includes a grant by us to bms of a license to commercialize mdx  a fully human antibody product developed using our ultimab human antibody development system  that is antagonistic to ctla mdx is currently under investigation for the treatment of a broad range of cancers and other diseases 
the collaboration also includes the grant by us to bms of a sub license to mdx  a gp peptide vaccine licensed by us from the us public health service  for use with mdx for the treatment of metastatic melanoma 
we and bms are currently conducting a phase iii clinical trial with mdx and mdx combination therapy in stage iii and stage iv metastatic melanoma patients at multiple sites within the us as part of the collaboration  we and bms have committed to an initial multi year budget of approximately million to fund the development of mdx as a potential treatment for a broad range of cancers 
bms will be responsible for of all development costs related to clinical trials intended to support regulatory approval in both the us and europe  with the remaining to be paid by us 
we and bms will share equally the costs of any clinical trials of products intended solely for regulatory approval in the us  and bms will be fully responsible for all development costs that relate solely to regulatory approval in europe and other parts of the world 
under the terms of the collaboration  we could receive up to million from bms if all regulatory milestones are met  plus up to an additional million in sales related milestones 
we will also have the option to co promote any products in the us  and  if we elect to exercise this option and have participated in the funding of the applicable phase ii clinical trial s  we will receive of any profits from commercial sales 
in the event we choose not to exercise our co promotion rights  bms will have exclusive commercial rights in the us and will pay us royalties on commercial sales 
outside the us  bms will have exclusive commercial rights and will pay us royalties on commercial sales 
pursuant to these agreements  bms made an initial cash payment to us on january  of million 
in addition  bms purchased a total of  unregistered shares of our common stock at a purchase price equal to per share for an aggregate purchase price of million 
these shares were issued in a private placement pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by section of the securities act of the purchase price represented a premium to the market price on the date we entered into the collaboration 
bms has agreed to a two year lock up period with respect to any sales of such stock 
we have no future obligation to register such stock 
contractual obligations our material contractual obligations under lease  debt and research funding agreements for the next five years  and thereafter  as of december   are as follows payments due by period less than year years years after years total in thousands contractual obligations convertible notes research funding operating leases and other total contractual cash obligations this table does not include a any milestone payments which may become payable to third parties under research collaborations or license agreements as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known  b any royalty payments to third parties as the amounts of such payments  timing and or the likelihood of such payments are not known  c amounts  if any  that may be committed in the future to construct additional facilities  d contracts that are entered into in the ordinary course of business which are not material in the aggregate in any period presented above and e any obligations related to the collaboration with bms which became effective in january our convertible notes may be converted to common stock prior to the maturity date and  therefore  may not require the use of our capital resources 
in january  we completed the redemption of all of our notes which was previously announced in december holders of all of the outstanding notes million converted their notes into a total of  shares of our common stock prior to the redemption date 
the aggregate amount of convertible notes outstanding in this table does not reflect the redemption of the notes 
financial uncertainties related to potential future milestone payments effective september   we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with kirin  which provides for us to exchange with kirin certain cross licenses for each other s technology for the development and commercialization of human antibody products 
pursuant to a letter of intent that was superceded by the collaboration and license agreement  we and kirin developed the km mouse  a unique crossbred mouse that combines the traits of our humab mouse with kirin s tc mouse 
under the collaboration and license agreement  we are exchanging cross licenses with kirin with respect to the km mouse and other antibody generating mice 
in addition  certain of the cross licenses granted under the collaboration and license agreement are subject to license  milestone and royalty payments by one party to the other 
through december   we have not made any milestone payments to kirin although approximately million has been accrued as of december  representing a payment due kirin as a result of our collaboration with pfizer 
based on a total of two products we are developing which use or  we believe may use  kirin technology that i are currently in clinical trials  or ii we anticipate may enter clinical trials through the end of  we may be required to make milestone payments to kirin aggregating up to approximately million with respect to such products  or a maximum of approximately million per product 
our future milestone payment obligations to kirin may or may not be triggered  and may vary in size  depending on a number of variables  almost all of which are currently unknown  including the following whether or not a decision is made to request a license from kirin  the type of license requested research or commercial  the success and timing of development efforts and clinical trials of product candidates covered by any such licenses  the type of product developed  payment obligations differ depending on whether a product is an ex vivo therapeutic  in vivo therapeutic  research reagent or diagnostic  and other financial provisions of the kirin agreement that provide for variations in fee levels and netting of certain payments over specified periods of time that may impact the total amount potentially payable to kirin for any particular license fee or milestone payment 
we have also entered into a number of other agreements that contain licenses of third party technology which may be used together with our own platform technologies for the generation  development and or manufacture of our antibody products 
in addition  we have entered into other third party agreements that contain licenses associated with antibody products that target specific antigens 
many of these agreements contain milestones payments that are due with respect to products using targeting the licensed technology antigen only if and when certain specified pre commercialization events occur 
not all of our products currently under development trigger such milestone payments 
through december   we had made milestone payments of approximately million under these agreements 
in addition  under the agreements we currently have in place other than with kirin  based on a total of five products we are developing for which milestones are potentially due and that i are now in clinical trials  or ii which we anticipate may enter clinical trials before the end of  we may be obligated to make future milestone payments aggregating up to approximately million with respect to such products 
in general  potential milestone payments for our antibody products may or may not be triggered under these licenses  and may vary in size  depending on a number of variables  almost all of which are currently uncertain 
typically  the events that trigger these payments per product include submission of ind s or foreign equivalents  commencement of phase i  phase ii and or phase iii clinical trials or foreign equivalents  submission of bla s or foreign equivalents  and receipt of marketing approval s to sell products in a particular country or region 
in addition  the licenses above may trigger royalty payments in connection with the commercialization of certain of our products 
to date  we have not made any royalty payments on sales of our products and believe we are at least a few years away from selling any products that would require us to make any such royalty payments 
whether we will be obligated to make milestone or royalty payments in the future is subject to the success of our product development efforts and  accordingly  is inherently uncertain 
future liquidity resources our current sources of liquidity are our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  interest and dividends earned on such cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  contract and licensing revenue and sales of our products for research 
we believe that such sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our operating  debt service  and capital requirements for at least the next months 
to the extent our notes are converted into shares of our common stock on or before their maturity date  we will have use of that portion of the principal amount of the notes to fund our on going operations 
in any event  we may require additional financing within this time frame and may raise funds through public or private financings  line of credit arrangements  collaborative relationships and or other methods 
the use of cash on hand or other financial alternatives will depend on several factors including  but not limited to  the future success of our products in clinical development  the prevailing interest rate environment  and access to the capital markets 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise such additional funds 
we may be unable to raise sufficient funds to complete development of any of our product candidates or to continue operations 
as a result  we may face delay  reduction or elimination of research and development programs or preclinical or clinical trials  in which case our business  financial condition or results of operations may be materially harmed 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
historically  in accordance with sfas and sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  we had elected to follow the disclosure only provisions of statement no 
and  accordingly  continue to account for share based compensation under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
and related interpretations 
under apb  when stock options are issued with an exercise price equal to the market price of the underlying stock price on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized in the financial statements  and compensation expense in only disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 
we will be required to adopt statement no 
r no later than the quarter beginning july  we are currently in the process of evaluating the option valuation methods and adoption transition alternatives available under statement r 
although we have not yet determined the impact of statement r  it may be significant to our consolidated results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we regularly invest excess operating cash in deposits with major financial institutions  money market funds  notes issued by the us government  as well as fixed income investments and us bond funds both of which can be readily purchased or sold using established markets 
we believe that the market risk arising from our holdings of these financial instruments is minimal 
we do not have exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates as we have no variable interest rate debt outstanding 
we do not believe we have any material exposure to market risks associated with interest rates  however  we may experience reinvestment risk as fixed income securities mature and are reinvested in securities bearing lower interest rates 
we may be exposed to exchange conversion differences in translating the foreign results of our investment in genmab to us dollars 
depending upon the relative strengthening or weakening of the us dollar  the conversion difference could be significant
