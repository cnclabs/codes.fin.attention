item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of factors including  but not limited to  those under business risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading outsourcer of web based account presentation  payment and relationship management services to financial services providers nationwide 
our services  branded in the clients name  integrate seamlessly into a single vendor  end to end solution  supported by customer care  targeted consumer marketing  training and other network and technical professional products and services 
registered end users using account presentation  bill payment or both  are the major drivers of our revenues 
exclusive of the users obtained in the acquisition of incurrent  from december  through december   the number of users using our account presentation services increased  and the number of users using our payment services increased  for an overall increase in users 
while we have seen some reduction in average monthly recurring revenue per user  due largely to our decisions to fix price the account presentation service to our clients and offer volume based bill payment price reductions  this has been more than offset by a decline in the average monthly recurring cost per user  thereby improving our gross margin 
gross margin for the year ended december  was  and it increased to for the year ended december  we have long term service contracts with our financial services provider clients 
the majority of our revenues are recurring  though these contracts also provide for implementation  set up and other non recurring fees 
account presentation services revenues are based on either a monthly license fee  allowing our financial institution clients to register an unlimited number of customers  or a monthly fee for each registered customer 
payment services revenues are based on either a monthly fee for each customer enrolled  a fee per executed transaction  or a combination of both 
our clients pay nearly all of our fees and then determine if or how they want to pass these costs on to their users 
they typically provide account presentation services to users free of charge  as they derive significant potential benefits including account retention  delivery and paper cost savings  account consolidation and cross selling of other products 
as of december  approximately of our clients were charging their users for providing payment services 
as a network based service provider  we have made substantial up front investments in infrastructure  particularly for our proprietary systems 
while we continue to incur ongoing development and maintenance costs  we believe the infrastructure we have built provides us with significant operating leverage 
in we began an effort to upgrade and rewrite certain of our applications infrastructure that will continue into we expect that this effort will require incremental capital expenditures  primarily for additional development labor  of between million and million over that period 
we continue to automate processes and develop applications that allow us to make only small increases in labor and other operating costs relative to increases in customers and transactions 
we believe our financial and operating performance will be based primarily on our ability to leverage additional end users and transactions over this relatively fixed cost base 
critical accounting policies the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our annual audited financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
the december  consolidated balance sheet reflects the acquisition of incurrent  which we completed on december  the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december   however  does not include any results for incurrent  as these results were deemed immaterial to our results for the year 
the provision for losses on accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts are recognized based on our estimate  which considers our historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data and financial health of specific customers 
our provision for losses on accounts receivable was approximately  on revenues of million 
at december  the allowance for doubtful accounts was  inclusive of approximately  which resulted from our acquisition of incurrent 
this represents management s estimate of the probable losses in the accounts receivable balance at december  while the allowance for doubtful accounts and the provision for losses on accounts receivable depend to a large degree on future conditions  management does not forecast significant adverse developments in we wrote off approximately  of bad debt in property and equipment  including leasehold improvements  are recorded at cost 
software and hardware consisting of central processing systems and terminals represent the majority of the property and equipment and are potentially subject to technological changes and obsolescence 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets  which are generally three to five years 
equipment recorded under capital leases is amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset 
we capitalize the cost of computer software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop no 

capitalized computer software costs consist primarily of payroll related and consulting costs incurred during the development stage 
we expense costs related to preliminary project assessments  research and development  re engineering  training and application maintenance as they are incurred 
capitalized software costs are being depreciated on a straight line basis over a period of three years upon being placed in service 
we periodically evaluate the assets for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
we generate revenues from service fees  professional services  and other supporting services 
service fees are primarily composed of three business lines  account presentation services  payment services and relationship management services 
revenues from service fees include new user registration fees  account access fees  transaction fees  customer service fees and relationship marketing support fees 
revenues from service fees are recognized over the term of the contract as the services are provided 
professional services revenues consist of implementation fees associated with the linking of our financial institution client s to our quotien sm e financial suite through various networks  web development and hosting fees  training fees and communication services 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab no 
 which we adopted effective january   implementation fees and related direct implementation costs are recognized on a straight line basis over the contract term as the services are provided  which typically range from one to five years generally three years 
prior to  we recognized nonrefundable implementation fees as revenue under the percentage of completion method as certain milestone output measures were completed 
due to the adoption of sab no 
 revenue that was previously recognized under our prior revenue recognition policy will be recognized under our revised revenue recognition policy through periods up to because some contract periods extend through during the years ended december   and  we recognized revenue of   and  respectively  and related direct incremental costs that were included in the cumulative effect adjustment at january  revenues from web development  web hosting and training are recognized over the term of the contract as the services are provided 
other revenues consist of service fees associated with enhanced third party solutions and termination fees 
service fees for enhanced third party solutions include fully integrated bill payment and account retrieval through intuit s quicken  check ordering  inter institution funds transfer  account aggregation and check imaging 
revenues from these service fees are recognized over the term of the contract as the services are provided 
termination fees are recognized upon termination of a contract 
in december  emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf no 
 was released effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  eitf no 
establishes new requirements for determining whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
we adopted eitf no 
and there has been no material impact on the financial position or results of operations from the adoption of eitf no 
we have a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset resulting from our net operating loss carryforwards since the likelihood of the realization of that asset cannot be determined 
our history of losses and relatively limited experience generating taxable income constitute significant negative evidence about the realization of the deferred tax asset 
our projection of future taxable income does not provide positive evidence of equal or greater significance to overcome the negative evidence 
therefore  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 we recognize a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be realized 
in the third quarter of  we adopted a policy to recognize as assets the amounts underlying bill payment checks drawn upon our escrow accounts that have been outstanding for at least a year after reviewing legal analysis from outside counsel to ensure that there is a basis for making a claim of ownership to such funds 
our policy is to recognize checks that have been outstanding more than a year and are less than as an offset to payment processing costs after taking a reserve on the assets 
checks greater than will be recognized as assets after they are outstanding for two years with no reserve on the assets 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized and million  respectively  in assets as an offset to payment processing costs incurred during those years and have a  reserve at december  also see note  summary of significant accounting policies  which discusses accounting policies 
financial condition while we have achieved net income for the past six quarters and expect our profitability to be sustainable  we have historically experienced operating losses and negative cash flow due to the initial costs of developing our infrastructure and the early revenues typical of an emerging market segment 
as a result  at december  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of equity and debt securities 
our ongoing working capital requirements consist primarily of personnel costs related to providing our services and operating  enhancing and maintaining our systems 
cash and investments in securities available for sale were and million as of december  and  respectively 
the million decrease in cash and investments in available for sale securities results from million in capital expenditures and million in cash used in the acquisition of incurrent 
these cash expenditures were partially offset by million in cash generated by operating activities and million in cash generated by financing activities

account presentation services revenues generated by our client base exclusive of cal fed and first virginia decreased versus even though the number of year end account presentation services users increased by compared to the prior year end 
this was the result of a decrease in the average monthly revenue per account presentation services user 
this decrease was attributable to the fact that we price our account presentation service largely using a monthly license fee pricing model in an effort to drive adoption of those services 
this allows our financial institution clients to register an unlimited number of account presentation services users as evidenced by the increase in account presentation services adoption in to whom we can then attempt to up sell our higher margin bill pay products and other services
