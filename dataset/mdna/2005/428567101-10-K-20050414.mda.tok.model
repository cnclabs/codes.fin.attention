item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview hibbett is a rapidly growing operator of sporting goods stores in small to mid sized markets predominantly in the southeast  mid atlantic and midwest 
our stores offer a broad assortment of quality athletic equipment  footwear and apparel with a high level of customer service 
as of january  we operated a total of retail stores composed of hibbett sports stores  sports additions athletic shoe stores and four sports co 
superstores in states 
our primary retail format and growth vehicle is hibbett sports  a  square foot store located in enclosed malls and in dominant strip centers which are generally the center of commerce within the area and which are usually anchored by a wal mart store 
we believe hibbett sports stores are typically the primary sporting goods retailers in their markets due to the extensive selection of traditional team merchandise and a high level of customer service 
we do not expect that the average size of our stores opening in fiscal will vary significantly from the average size of stores opened in fiscal hibbett historically has comparable store sales in the low to mid single digit range and we plan to increase total square footage by approximately in fiscal year we believe total sales percentage growth will be in the mid teens in fiscal over the past three years  we have increased our product margin due to improved vendor discounts  increased efficiencies in logistics and favorable leveraging of our store occupancy costs 
we expect gross profit to increase to basis points in fiscal attributable to an expected decrease in markdowns as a percent of sales and continued improvement of inventory turns 
due to our increased sales  we have leveraged our store operating  selling and administrative expenses and have offset recent increases in certain expenses relating to corporate governance 
with our expected sales increase  we plan to leverage expenses to basis points in fiscal we also expect to continue to generate sufficient cash to enable us to expand and remodel our store base  provide capital expenditures for both warehouse and technology upgrade projects and to repurchase our company stock while increasing our cash position 
hibbett operates on a or week fiscal year ending on the saturday nearest to january of each year 
the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal years ended january   january  and february   all include weeks of operations 
restatement of financial statements following disclosure by several restaurant companies and other retailers in fiscal and in connection with performing our fiscal year end reporting control processes  we performed a comprehensive review of our lease accounting practices 
we reviewed our lease portfolio and adjusted the amortization period for leasehold improvements to the shorter of fixed  non cancelable  initial lease term or the asset s useful life and have recognized the effect of pre opening rent holidays related to the build out period over the related lease term 
landlord reimbursements of leasehold improvements have been reclassified from a contra asset in property and equipment to other liabilities in the consolidated statements of operations and from a reduction of capital expenditures to an increase in cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
retained earnings at the beginning of the fiscal year ended february   has been adjusted for the after tax impacts of the restatements of earlier periods 
while we do not consider the net dollar amounts to be material to net earnings  financial position or net cash flows for the periods presented  we believe it is appropriate to align our historical accounting results with the sec s comments on lease accounting under gaap  and we have done so  as reflected in our decision to restate results for certain prior years 
these accounting changes reduced net income by million  million and million for the fiscal years ended january   january   and february   respectively  and resulted in a million reduction in retained earnings at the beginning of fiscal year ended february  we will not amend our previously filed annual reports on form k or quarterly reports on forms q for the restatement 
therefore  the financial statements and related information contained in such reports should no longer be relied upon 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for additional discussion 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of certain items included in our consolidated statements of operations expressed for the periods indicated 
percentages may not add due to rounding for the fiscal years ended as restated as restated january  january  february  net sales cost of goods sold  including warehouse  distribution and store occupancy costs gross profit store operating  selling and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization operating income interest income  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal as restated net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the weeks ended january   from million for the weeks ended january  we attribute this increase to the following factors we opened hibbett sports stores and sports additions store and closed hibbett sports stores for a net stores opened of stores in the weeks ended january  new stores and stores not in the comparable store net sales calculation accounted for million of the increase in net sales 
we experienced a increase in comparable store net sales for the weeks ended january  higher comparable store net sales contributed million to the increase in net sales 
the increase in comparable store sales was driven by an increase in sales in footwear and equipment 
apparel was negative in comp stores due to a weakness in the pro licensed and college apparel categories 
footwear was led by women s performance  primarily running shoes  and the children s shoe categories 
performance and retro styles such as nike shox  nike air force  nike impax  nike miler  k swiss and new balance styles were the most popular in the period 
equipment sales were positively impacted by team sports  particularly by baseball and softball as our premium focus began to take effect 
these positive gains were somewhat offset by a decline in the demand for fitness equipment and individual sports equipment 
comparable store net sales data for the period reflects sales for our traditional format hibbett sports and sports additions stores open throughout the period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year 
gross profit 
cost of goods sold includes the cost of inventory  occupancy costs for stores and occupancy and operating costs for the distribution center 
gross profit was million  or of net sales  in the weeks ended january   compared with million  or of net sales  in the same period of the prior fiscal year 
this year s gross margin is primarily attributable to strong footwear sales which carry a somewhat lower gross margin than apparel and the leveraging of occupancy and warehouse cost and improved inventory turn 
product margin rate decreased somewhat due to a shift toward lower margin footwear and markdowns in licensed apparel 
occupancy  as a percent of net sales  improved by basis points year over year due to above average comparable store sales gains 
warehouse costs improved by basis points  primarily due to the leveraging of salaries and benefits 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  for the weeks ended january   compared with million  or of net sales  for the comparable period a year ago 
we attribute this decrease in store operating  selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales to the following factors labor and benefits expenses accounted for a decrease as a percent of net sales of basis points as compared to the same period last year 
business insurance expense experienced a decrease as a percent of net sales of basis points as compared to the same period last year 
returned check expense and net advertising expense accounted for a decrease as a percent of net sales of and basis points  respectively  as compared to the same period last year 
the decrease in store operating  selling and administrative expenses was somewhat offset by a basis point increase in professional fees related to sarbanes oxley compliance and testing and a basis point increase in credit card fees as a result of an increase in visa and mastercard interchange rates 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales was in the weeks ended january   and in the weeks ended january  the leveraging in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of net sales is due to an increase in sales this year compared to the same weeks last year 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes as a percentage of net sales was in the weeks ended january   compared to for the weeks ended january   due to an increase in pre tax income and an increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal the combined federal  state and local effective income tax rate as a percentage of pre tax income was for fiscal and for fiscal fiscal as restated compared to fiscal as restated net sales 
net sales increased million or  to million for the weeks ended january   from million for the comparable period in the prior year 
we attribute this increase to the following factors we opened hibbett sports stores and sports additions stores and closed hibbett sports stores for a net stores opened of stores in the weeks ended january  new stores and stores not in the comparable store net sales calculation accounted for million of the increase in net sales 
we experienced a increase in comparable store net sales for the weeks ended january  higher comparable store net sales contributed million to the increase in net sales 
the increase in comparable store net sales was primarily due to increased sales in apparel  although there were some gains in the footwear categories as well 
apparel sales  mainly college and pro licensed products and active wear  were driven by retro nba and nfl jerseys  under armour and nike dri fit performance wear  women s active wear and college apparel and cheerleading shorts 
footwear was led by basketball  new balance running shoes  nike shox  k swiss athletic shoes and the retro classic look 
equipment sales were down from prior year s numbers  primarily due to category elimination in individual sports such as racket sports  golf and in line skates 
our team sports business  which consists of baseball  basketball  football and soccer  improved during the fourth quarter but did not offset the decreases from the eliminated categories and the softness in the fitness category 
comparable store net sales data for the period reflects sales for our traditional format hibbett sports and sports additions stores open throughout the period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year 
gross profit 
cost of goods sold includes the cost of inventory  occupancy costs for stores and occupancy and operating costs for the distribution center 
gross profit was million  or of net sales  in the weeks ended january   compared with million  or of net sales  in the same period of the prior fiscal year 
the improved gross margin is primarily attributed to selling more merchandise at full price  the leveraging of occupancy and warehouse cost and improved logistics flow 
product margin improved basis points due to gains in initial mark up  a reduction in markdown rate and improvements in shrinkage 
occupancy  as a percent of net sales  improved by basis points year over year due to above average comparable store sales gains 
warehouse costs improved by basis points  primarily due to the leveraging of salaries and benefits 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  for the weeks ended january   compared with million  or of net sales  for the comparable period a year ago 
we attribute this decrease in store operating  selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales to the following factors retail store labor decreased as a percent of net sales by basis points this period compared with the same period last year due to higher than expected comparable store sales and improved labor controls 
store supplies were down basis points year over year and net advertising costs were reduced by basis points this year compared to the same week period last year 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales was in the weeks ended january   and in the weeks ended february  the reduction in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of net sales is due to an increase in sales this year compared to the same period last year 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes as a percentage of net sales was in the weeks ended january   compared to for the weeks ended february   due to an increase in pre tax income 
the combined federal  state and local effective income tax rate as a percentage of pre tax income was for fiscal and for fiscal liquidity and capital resources as described in note to the consolidated financial statements in item  we restated previously issued consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended january  and february  to correct our accounting for leases  related leasehold improvements and construction allowances 
while this restatement changed several cash flow components  cash and cash equivalents were not impacted for any fiscal year 
our capital requirements relate primarily to new store openings  stock repurchase and working capital requirements 
our working capital requirements are somewhat seasonal in nature and typically reach their peak near the end of the third and the beginning of the fourth quarters of our fiscal year 
historically  we have funded our cash requirements primarily through cash flow from operations and occasionally from borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
our statements of cash flows are summarized as follows in thousands for the fiscal years ended as restated as restated january  january  february  net cash provided by operating activities cash flows provided by used in investing activities capital expenditures proceeds from sales of property and equipment net cash used in investing activities cash flows provided by used in financing activities revolving loan borrowings and repayments  net proceeds from options exercised and purchase of shares under the employee stock purchase plan cash used for stock repurchase net cash provided by used in financing activities net cash provided by operating activities has historically been driven by net income levels combined with fluctuations in inventory and accounts payable balances 
net income has increased in each of the last three fiscal years 
in addition  we have continued to increase our inventory levels and turns throughout these periods as the number of stores has increased 
however  inventory levels on a per store basis have decreased 
we financed this increase in total inventory primarily through cash generated from operations in each of the last three fiscal years 
these activities resulted in cash flows provided by operating activities of million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
with respect to cash flows from investing activities  capital expenditures for fiscal were million compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal capital expenditures for the weeks ended january   were primarily related to the opening of new hibbett sports stores and new sports additions store  the refurbishing of existing stores and purchasing corporate assets  including automobiles  warehouse equipment and technology upgrades 
we estimate the cash outlay for capital expenditures in fiscal will be approximately million  which relates to the opening of approximately hibbett sports stores exclusive of store closings  remodeling of selected existing stores and improvements at the company s headquarters and distribution center 
net cash provided by used in financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
cash flows from financing activities have historically represented financing of our long term growth 
in fiscal and  we received million and million  respectively  excluding the related tax benefit  from proceeds related to stock options exercised and shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal  we expended million on the repurchase of our common stock see note to the consolidated financial statements in item 
we have an unsecured revolving credit facility that allows borrowings up to million and which will expire november  the credit facility is subject to renewal every two years 
under the provisions of this facility  we pay a commitment fee of  annually and can draw down funds when the balance of our main operating account falls below  we plan to renew this facility in november and do not anticipate any problems in doing so  however  no assurance can be given that we will be granted a renewal or terms which are acceptable to the company 
in fiscal  the unsecured revolving credit facility allowed borrowings up to million and we also maintained an unsecured working capital line of credit for million  which expired on january  and was not renewed 
as of january   january  and february   we had no debt outstanding under any of these facilities 
based on our current operating and store opening plans  management believes we can adequately fund our cash needs for the foreseeable future through cash generated from operations 
the following table lists the aggregate maturities of various classes of obligations and expiration amounts of various classes of commitments related to hibbett sporting goods  inc at january  payments due under contractual obligations in thousands revolving capital lease operating credit obligations leases total fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter see long term debt consolidated financial statement note in item as of fiscal year ended  we do not have any capital lease obligations 
see lease commitments consolidated financial statement note in item off balance sheet arrangements we have not provided any financial guarantees as of january  all purchase obligations are cancelable and therefore are not included in the table above 
we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating our business 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements 
inflation and other economic factors our ability to provide quality merchandise on a profitable basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we cannot control 
national or international events  including the war on terrorism  could lead to disruptions in economies in the united states or in foreign countries where a significant portion of our merchandise is manufactured 
these and other factors could increase our merchandise costs and other costs that are critical to our operations 
consumer spending could also decline because of economic pressures 
merchandise costs 
based on current economic conditions  we expect that merchandise costs per unit will remain constant in fiscal freight costs 
due to rising fuel costs  we may experience increases in freight costs 
however  we do not expect these fuel cost increases to have a material effect on our results of operations as we continue to leverage the costs associated with inbound freight against the cost of outbound freight 
minimum wage 
an increase in the mandated minimum wage could significantly increase our payroll costs 
in prior years  proposals increasing the federal minimum wage by at least per hour have narrowly failed to pass both houses of congress 
insurance costs 
during fiscal  property  casualty and health insurance costs increased significantly 
in fiscal  general business insurance and health insurance leveraged favorably as a percent to sales 
we expect that these costs will remain relatively stable in fiscal recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
revised  consolidation of variable interest entities  fin r  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
fin r replaces interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january we were required to apply fin r to variable interests in variable interest entities vies created after december  for variable interests in vies created before january   the interpretation was applied beginning on january  for any vies that must be consolidated under fin r that were created before january   the assets  liabilities and non controlling interests of the vie initially would be measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
if determining the carrying amounts is not practicable  fair value at the date fin r first applies may be used to measure the assets  liabilities and non controlling interest of the vie 
there was no impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
sfas no

our critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies reflected in the consolidated financial statements are detailed below 
revenue recognition 
retail merchandise sales occur on site in our retail stores 
the customers have the option of paying the full purchase price of the merchandise upon sale or paying a down payment and placing the merchandise on layaway 
the customer may make further payments in installments  but the entire purchase price for merchandise placed on layaway must be received by us within days 
we record the down payment and any installments as deferred revenue until the customer pays the entire purchase price for the merchandise and takes possession of such merchandise 
we recognize merchandise revenues at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise 
the cost of coupon sales incentives is recognized at the time the related revenue is recognized by us 
proceeds received from the issuance of gift cards are initially recorded as deferred revenue and such proceeds are subsequently recognized as revenue at the time the customer redeems such gift cards and takes possession of the merchandise 
inventory valuation 
cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method 
in using this method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the retail method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis 
inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments 
these include estimates of merchandise markdowns and shrinkage  which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost  as well as the resulting gross margins 
the averaging required in applying the retail inventory valuation method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns may  under certain circumstances  result in inaccurate cost figures 
inaccurate inventory cost may be caused by applying the retail inventory method to a group of products that have differing characteristics related to gross margin and turnover 
we accrue for inventory shrinkage based on the actual historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories 
these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are performed and reconciled to the general ledger 
store counts are performed on a cyclical basis and the distribution center s counts are performed mid year and at the end of december or in early january every year 
our management believes that the application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
accrued expenses 
on a monthly basis  we estimate certain material expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred 
our most material estimates relate to payroll and payroll tax expenses  property taxes  insurance related expenses  utilities and other expenses 
estimates are primarily based on current activity and historical results and are adjusted as our estimates change 
differences in our estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual materially different from the accrual calculated 
historically  the differences in these accruals have not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
income taxes 
on a quarterly basis  we estimate our required tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets 
our taxes payable are estimated based on enacted tax rates  including estimated tax rates in states where our store base is growing applied to the income expected to be taxed currently 
we assess the realizability of our deferred tax projections for future taxable income 
we cannot guarantee that we will generate income in future years 
historically  we have not experience significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual 
dividend policy we have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain our future earnings to finance the growth and development of our business and for our stock repurchase  and therefore do not anticipate declaring or paying cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 
any future decision to declare or pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our financial condition  results of operations  capital requirements and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant 
controls and procedures we maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec  and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer see item a 
quarterly and seasonal fluctuations we have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income 
our net sales and operating income are typically higher in the fourth quarter due to sales increases during the holiday selling season 
however  the seasonal fluctuations are mitigated by the strong product demand in the spring and back to school sales periods 
our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of new store openings  the amount and timing of net sales contributed by new stores  the level of pre opening expenses associated with new stores  the relative proportion of new stores to mature stores  merchandise mix  the relative proportion of stores represented by each of our three store concepts and demand for apparel and accessories driven by local interest in sporting events
