item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the financial and business analysis below provides information which the company believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
this financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the following discussion and certain other sections of this report contain statements reflecting the company s views about its future performance and constitute forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of these views involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and  accordingly  the company s actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
readers should consider that various factors  including changes in general economic conditions and competitive market conditions  pricing pressures  relationships with key customers  industry consolidation of retailers  wholesalers and builders  shifts in distribution  the influence of e commerce  and other factors discussed in the executive level overview  critical accounting policies and estimates and outlook for the company sections  may affect the company s performance 
the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
executive level overview the company is engaged principally in the manufacture and sale of home improvement and building products 
these products are sold to the home improvement and home construction markets through mass merchandisers  hardware stores  home centers  builders  distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors 
the company also supplies and installs insulation and other building products for builders in the new residential construction market 
factors that affect the company s results of operations include the levels of home improvement and residential construction activity principally in north america and europe including repair and remodeling and new construction  the company s ability to effectively manage its overall cost structure  fluctuations in european currencies primarily the european euro and great britain pound  the importance of and the company s relationships with home centers including the home depot  which represented approximately percent of the company s sales in as distributors of home improvement and building products and the company s ability to maintain its leadership positions in its markets in the face of increasing global competition 
historically  the company has been able to largely offset the impact on its revenues of cyclical declines in the new construction and home improvement markets through new product introductions and acquisitions as well as market share gains 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company regularly reviews its estimates  which are based on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
receivables and inventories the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings  including special pricing arrangements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable are maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value with expense estimates made for obsolescence or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the recorded cost of inventories and their estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
on an on going basis  the company monitors these estimates and records adjustments for differences between estimates and actual experience 
historically  actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using these estimates 
financial investments the company maintains investments in marketable securities  which aggregated million  and a number of private equity funds  which aggregated million  at december  the investments in private equity funds are carried at cost and are evaluated for impairment at each reporting period  or when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist  using information made available by the fund managers and other assumptions 
the investments in marketable equity securities are carried at fair value  and unrealized gains and unrealized losses that are deemed to be temporary are recorded as a component of shareholders equity  net of tax effect  in other comprehensive income loss 
the company records an impairment charge to earnings when an investment has experienced a decline in value that is deemed to be other than temporary 
future changes in market conditions  the performance of underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recognized an impairment charge of million related to the company s investment in furniture brands international nyse fbn 
the fbn common stock was received in june from the company s investment in furnishings international inc debt 
based on its review  the company considers the decline in market value related to this investment to be other than temporary and recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million to reduce the cost basis from per share to per share  at december   the aggregate carrying value after the adjustment was million 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company records the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  the company is no longer recording amortization expense related to goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
in the fourth quarter of each year  or as an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount  the company completes the impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets utilizing a discounted cash flow method 
this test for indicated that goodwill related to certain european businesses was impaired 
the company recognized a non cash  pre tax impairment charge of million million  after tax in the fourth quarter of intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated lives 
the company evaluates the remaining useful lives of amortizable intangible assets at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 
determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions  including long term projections of cash flows  market conditions and appropriate discount rates 
the company s judgments are based on historical experience  current market trends  consultations with external valuation specialists and other information 
while the company believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable  different assumptions could result in a different outcome 
in estimating future cash flows  the company relies on internally generated five year forecasts for sales and operating profits  including capital expenditures and generally a three percent long term assumed growth rate of cash flows for periods after the five year forecast 
the company generally develops these forecasts based on recent sales data for existing products  planned timing of new product launches  housing starts and repair and remodeling estimates for existing homes 
in the fourth quarter of  the company estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for most of its business units were greater than the carrying values 
any increases in estimated discounted cash flows would have no impact on the reported value of goodwill 
employee retirement plans accounting for defined benefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future  based on vested years of service  and attributing those costs over the time period each employee works 
pension costs and obligations of the company are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  compensation increases and discount rates for obligations 
the company considers current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in selecting these assumptions 
the company selects these assumptions with assistance from outside advisors such as consultants  lawyers and actuaries 
changes in assumptions used could result in changes to the related pension costs and obligations within the company s consolidated financial statements in any given period 
in  the company decreased its discount rate for obligations to percent from percent  which reflects the decline in long term interest rates 
the assumed asset return is percent  reflecting the expected long term return on plan assets 
the company s underfunded amount for the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets decreased to million from million in this is primarily the result of asset returns above projections and company contributions 
qualified domestic pension plan assets in had a net gain of approximately percent as compared with average returns of percent for the largest  plan benchmark 
the company s projected benefit obligation relating to the unfunded non qualified supplemental defined benefit pension plans was million at december  compared with million at december  the company expects pension expense for its qualified defined benefit pension plans in to approximate such expense in if the company assumed that the future return on plan assets was percent instead of percent  the pension expense for would increase by approximately million 
income taxes the company has considered future income and gains from investments and other identified tax planning strategies  including the potential sale of certain operating assets  and identified potential sources of future foreign taxable income in assessing the need for establishing a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets at december   particularly related to its after tax capital loss carryforward of million and its after tax foreign tax credit carryforward of million 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  a valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made 
changes to the us tax law enacted in the fourth quarter of significantly impacted the taxation of foreign earnings distributions 
as a result  the company made a dividend distribution of accumulated earnings from certain of its foreign subsidiaries of approximately million in the fourth quarter of such earnings had been permanently reinvested  pursuant to the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 prior to the fourth quarter of under the company s previous tax planning strategy to invest such earnings in operating and non operating foreign investments 
this dividend generated significant foreign tax credits that were used to offset the majority of the us tax on the dividend and created a million foreign tax credit carryforward at december  the company believes that the foreign tax credit carryforward will be utilized before the newly enacted year carryforward period expires on december   principally with identified potential sources of future income taxed in foreign jurisdictions at rates less than the present us rate of percent 
therefore  a valuation allowance was not recorded at december  because the company changed its position with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings  the company recorded a million deferred tax liability in the fourth quarter of  primarily related to the excess of its book basis over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries 
other commitments and contingencies certain of the company s products and product finishes and services are generally covered by a warranty to be free from defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from one year to the life of the product 
at the time of the sale  the company accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide products  parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations 
the company s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions 
to the extent that the company experiences any changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims  its warranty liability is adjusted accordingly 
the company is subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims including income taxes with respect to matters generally arising in the ordinary course of business 
liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgments based on the professional knowledge and experience of management and its legal counsel 
when estimates of the company s exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria for recognition under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  amounts are recorded as charges to earnings 
the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to the company may differ due to subsequent developments 
see note t to the company s consolidated financial statements for information regarding legal proceedings involving the company 
the company used estimates for the number of claims expected and the average cost per claim to determine the liability related to the behr litigation settlement in in  the company estimated that the remaining unpaid claims and administration costs related to the washington state settlement would be less than originally estimated and reduced the related accrual recognizing income for litigation settlement by million 
internal controls and procedures the company s operations are highly decentralized and financial and transaction processing and control systems are distributed across the company s multiple business units 
the company maintains monitoring controls through its group oversight function  a company wide accounting policy manual and a well resourced internal audit function that works closely with an international accounting firm  which is not the company s external auditor 
additionally  the company believes it fosters an effective control environment through a strong corporate governance structure driven by the membership and activities of its board of directors and audit committee  its code of business ethics and various company wide programs related to legal and ethical compliance 
in  the company conducted and concluded its first comprehensive evaluation of internal control over financial reporting under the new requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of the act 
during the course of this process  the company determined that there was a lapse in controls associated with a business integration involving two of the company s business units 
management concluded that the lapse in controls was a material weakness based on the potential for possible error and impact of such potential error on the company s consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  based on the requirements of the act  the company concluded that its internal control over financial reporting did not operate effectively as of december  after extensive review and additional testing procedures that the company considered appropriate under the circumstances  the company determined that this material weakness condition did not result in a material misstatement in the company s consolidated financial statements as of  and for the year ended  december  management has taken a number of remediation steps and is in the process of taking additional steps associated with this matter as disclosed in management s remediation plan in item of this report 
in addition to the incremental external costs and expenses of approximately million primarily professional fees associated with complying with section of the act  the company has also invested significantly in training and additional infrastructure  including additional human resources  technological enhancements and process improvements 
the company believes it has incurred a disproportionate level of expense related to this initiative  relative to other companies of comparable size  due to its disaggregated business model 
while the company s decentralized operating structure and the number of autonomous business units serve to disperse risk  these factors also resulted in a more time consuming and costly environment for the company to implement the requirements of the act 
the company  with senior management actively involved  began its section implementation process in early the company s compliance with the section requirements was highly complex and involved  given the continuing refinement of guidance related to the act s requirements and the company s decentralized operating structure  including disparate business systems  its relatively smaller foreign business units with different languages and cultures  and its installation services businesses with approximately small branch locations 
nevertheless  the company expects to continue to benefit from the implementation of the act s requirements and is committed to a continuous improvement model of internal control  as evidenced through its significant investment of resources and its historic strong tone at the top philosophy of internal control 
corporate development strategy acquisitions in past years have enabled the company to build a critical mass that has given the company a strong position in the markets it serves and has increased the company s importance to its customers 
the company is now intensifying its focus on leveraging the critical mass to build greater value for its shareholders 
the company s focus includes additional cost reduction initiatives as well as increased utilization of synergies among the company s business units 
the company expects to maintain a more balanced growth strategy of internal growth  share repurchases and fewer acquisitions with increased emphasis on cash flow and return on invested capital 
as part of its strategic planning  the company continues to review all of its businesses to determine which businesses are not core to continuing operations 
the company reviews its business portfolio on an ongoing basis as part of its corporate strategic planning and  in the first quarter of  determined that several european businesses were not core to the company s long term growth strategy and  accordingly  embarked on a plan of disposition 
these businesses had combined net sales in excess of million and an approximate net book value of million 
the company originally estimated expected proceeds from the sale of these businesses to approximate million 
the company reduced its estimate of expected proceeds during recognizing pre tax charges of million million  after tax for those businesses expected to be divested at a loss for these operations as a result of lower than expected operating results as well as a weaker than expected demand for the businesses that the company planned to divest 
any gains resulting from the dispositions are recognized as such transactions are completed 
the company expects aggregate net proceeds to approximate million upon completion of the dispositions  of which million was received in during  in separate transactions  the company completed the sale of its jung pumpen  the alvic group  alma kuchen  e 
missel and sks group businesses in europe 
jung pumpen manufactures a wide variety of submersible and drainage pumps  the alvic group and alma kuchen manufacture kitchen cabinets  e 
missel manufactures acoustic insulation for baths and showers and sks group manufactures rolling shutters and ventilation systems  all of these businesses were included in discontinued operations 
total gross proceeds from the sale of these companies were million  including cash of million and notes receivable of million 
the company recognized a pre tax  net gain principally related to the sale of jung pumpen on the disposition of these businesses of million 
in  the company completed the sale of its baldwin hardware  weiser lock and marvel group businesses 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company has accounted for the businesses held for sale at december  as well as businesses which were sold in and as discontinued operations 
the sales and results of operations of the businesses sold in and and those held for sale at december  are included in the company s results from discontinued operations through the date of disposition 
during the time the company owned these businesses  they had net sales of million  million and million in  and  respectively  and income loss from discontinued operations before income taxes of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has largely funded its growth through cash provided by a combination of its operations  long term bank debt and other borrowings  and by the issuance of company common stock  including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions 
bank credit lines are maintained to ensure the availability of funds 
at december   debt agreements with banks syndicated in the united states relate to a billion year revolving credit agreement due and payable in november this agreement allows for borrowings denominated in us dollars or european euros 
interest is payable on borrowings under this agreement based on various floating rate options as selected by the company 
the previous day revolving credit agreement expired in november certain debt agreements contain limitations on additional borrowings  at december   the company had additional borrowing capacity  subject to availability  of up to billion 
certain debt agreements also contain a requirement for maintaining a certain level of net worth  at december   the company s net worth exceeded such requirement by approximately billion

in the fourth quarter of  the company repatriated cash related to accumulated earnings from certain of its foreign subsidiaries to the united states of approximately million 
during  the company increased its quarterly common stock dividend percent to 
per common share 
this marks the th consecutive year in which dividends have been increased 
although the company is aware of the greater interest in yield by many investors and has maintained an increased dividend payout in recent years  the company continues to believe that its shareholders long term interests are best served by investing a significant portion of its earnings in the future growth of the company 
maintaining high levels of liquidity and cash flow are among the company s financial strategies 
the company s total debt as a percent of total capitalization increased to percent at december  from percent at december  repurchases and retirement of company common stock contributed to the increase in the total debt to total capitalization ratio 
the company s working capital ratio was to and to at december  and  respectively 
the company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and does not use derivatives for trading purposes 
the derivatives used by the company during the year ended december  consist of interest rate swaps entered into in  for the purpose of effectively converting a portion of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt  which is expected to reduce interest expense  given current interest rates 
generally  under interest rate swap agreements  the company agrees with a counter party to exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount 
the derivative contracts are with two major creditworthy institutions  thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
the interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair value hedges  and the interest rate differential on interest rate swaps used to hedge existing debt is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the term of the agreement 
for fair value hedge transactions  changes in the fair value of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the item hedged are recognized in determining earnings 
the average variable interest rates are based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus a fixed adjustment factor 
the average effective rate on the interest rate swaps is 
at december   the interest rate swap agreements cover a notional amount of million of the company s fixed rate debt due july  at an interest rate of 
the hedges are considered percent effective because all of the critical terms of the derivative financial instruments match those of the hedged item 
accordingly  no gain or loss on the value of the hedges was recognized in the company s consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  and the amount recognized as a reduction of interest expense was million for the year ended december  certain of the company s european operations also entered into foreign currency forward contracts for the purpose of managing exposure to currency fluctuations primarily related to the united states dollar and the great britain pound

consolidated results of operations the company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
however  the company believes that certain non gaap performance measures and ratios  used in managing the business  may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods 
non gaap performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to  and not as an alternative for  the company s reported results 
sales and operations net sales for were billion  representing an increase of percent over excluding results from acquisitions  net sales also increased percent including a two percent increase relating to the effect of currency translation compared with the increase in net sales in is principally due to higher unit sales volumes of assembled cabinets  architectural coatings  installation services  vinyl and fiberglass windows and patio doors  and faucets
