item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview techteam is a global provider of information technology it and business process outsourcing support services to fortune companies  multinational companies  product providers  small and mid size companies  and government entities 
over the past months  techteam has acquired three companies 
as a result of these acquisitions  we have strategically added governmental technology services to our long standing core businesses of corporate helpdesk  professional services systems integration  technical staffing  and training services 
in order to better describe our business following these changes  we have modified our four reporting business segments into five new reporting segments diversified it outsourcing services comprised primarily of our former corporate helpdesk services segment  government technology services comprised of all services provided to government based customers primarily by our digital support corporation and sytel subsidiaries  it consulting and systems integration comprised primarily of our former professional services systems integration segment  technical staffing  and learning services formerly our training programs segment 
prior year amounts have been reclassified to reflect the current year presentation 
we grew our revenue in and significantly improved our operating performance over by pursuing four strategic initiatives grow our overall business through strategic  accretive acquisitions both domestically and internationally  expand our footprint in the it consulting and systems integration services sector  including technology services for government based customers  as we believe infrastructure support services and systems and software implementation services offer significant opportunity for complementary growth and improved gross margin  improve operating efficiencies and profitability  primarily in our diversified it outsourcing services operating segment  through various performance improvement and cost saving initiatives  and continue our growth in europe and establish multilingual helpdesk operations in romania to realize operational efficiencies and cost savings from offering our customers a blended solution with our multilingual helpdesk operations in belgium 
pursuant to our first two strategic initiatives  we completed the acquisition of two companies advanced network engineering nv sa ane on may  and digital support corporation dsc on december  ane is an information technology services and solutions company in belgium that provides software application  network infrastructure  and systems integration services to various global  pan european  and belgian customers 
ane is part of our it consulting and systems integration operating segment 
dsc is an information technology services and solutions company that provides network infrastructure  information assurance  enterprise application  systems integration  and hardware services and solutions to various governmental and commercial customers 
revenue and expense from dsc s government based customers comprise the majority of our newly created government technology services operating segment  while revenue and expense from dsc s commercial customers are included in our it consulting and systems integration operating segment 
ane and dsc contributed revenue of million and million  respectively  in  which resulted in an increase in it consulting and systems integration revenue of from to million and an increase in government technology services revenue of million 
continuing to pursue our first two strategic initiatives in  on january   we acquired sytel  inc sytel  an information technology services and solutions company that provides network engineering  outsourcing services  and systems integration services principally under prime contracts and subcontracts with agencies and departments of us government 
sytel had unaudited revenue and net income of million and million  respectively  for the year ended december   which is not included in the accompanying financial statements 
together  the government based customers of sytel and dsc will comprise the majority of our government technology services operating segment 
we believe our results also reflect progress in implementing our third strategic initiative  improving operating efficiencies and profitability through performance improvement and cost saving initiatives 
in and  we implemented various measures relating primarily to our diversified it outsourcing services operating segment including consistently aligning our headcount with the level of business being generated from our customers  reducing operational office space in the us and belgium  and implementing a global performance management process to promote operational improvements 
as a result  gross profit from diversified it outsourcing services increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in gross margin gross profit as a percentage of revenue from diversified it outsourcing services increased to in  from in the increase in this gross margin in was negatively impacted by a  pre tax charge in the fourth quarter for an impairment of a software asset 
excluding the impairment charge  gross margin from diversified it outsourcing services increased to in  from in the increase in gross profit and gross margin excluding the impairment charge was primarily due to increased business with new and existing customers in europe and realization of the aforementioned operational efficiencies and cost savings on a global basis 
finally  we made significant progress in toward meeting our fourth strategic initiative 
revenue generated from our european operations increased to million in  from million in in addition  we established helpdesk operations in bucharest  romania  with the delivery of customer support services beginning in april lastly  we improved our gross margin performance 
excluding revenue contributed by ane  revenue generated in europe increased to million in  from million in  primarily due to growth in business at our belgian and swedish subsidiaries and the strengthening of european currencies relative to the us dollar 
if revenue in europe in was translated at the average exchange rate for  reported revenue would have been reduced by approximately million 
since most of the company s international operating expenses are also incurred in the same foreign currencies in which the associated revenue is denominated  the net impact of exchange rate fluctuations on gross profit and operating income is considerably less than the estimated impact on revenue 
as we look to  we expect to face challenges that will likely impact our profitability in future periods 
first  we are required to adopt the provisions of section of the sarbanes oxley act of the act for the year ended december   which requires us to certify our system of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure 
we expect to incur between million to million of incremental expense in to implement this section of the act 
these costs may increase if it is determined that significant efforts will be required to remediate control deficiencies that may be identified during implementation 
next  we are investing in our global infrastructure to support our growth through the implementation of a new human capital management system during and  which will encompass most aspects of our global human resource functions 
we expect to incur approximately  to  of expense in during implementation before we begin to realize resulting operational efficiencies in future periods 
we are also investing in increased sales and marketing activities to promote the company and our service offerings and capabilities 
as our customers continue to require services delivered globally  we expect to make investments necessary to establish operations in new countries from time to time 
finally  as previously reported  a large helpdesk contract with daimlerchrysler ag has not been renewed and the company will lose another contract with liberty mutual insurance company on or about april   as the client is expected to take these services in house 
as services for these projects were delivered from our southfield  michigan helpdesk facility  our facility is currently underutilized 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  year ended december  increase decrease change in thousands revenue diversified it outsourcing services    government technology services    it consulting and systems integration 
   technical staffing    learning services total revenue    revenue from our diversified it outsourcing services increased to million in  from million in  primarily due to growth at our belgian and swedish subsidiaries  and the strengthening of the euro  british pound sterling  and swedish kroner relative to the us dollar 
these increases were partially offset by a contractual price reduction granted to ford motor company ford effective august  revenue from it consulting and systems integration increased to million in  from million in  due to our acquisitions of dsc and ane and additional business from new and existing customers in the united states 
excluding revenue contributed by dsc and ane  it consulting and systems integration revenue increased to million in  from million in revenue from technical staffing decreased to million in  from million in  primarily due to staffing reductions in the united states that were partially offset by additional business received in europe 
the increase in revenue from government technology services was attributable to our acquisition of dsc on december  revenue generated in the united states increased to million in  from million in  due to our acquisition of dsc 
excluding revenue contributed by dsc  revenue generated in the united states increased to million in  from million in  primarily due to additional business from new and existing customers  which was partially offset by a contractual price reduction to ford effective august   as hereinafter described  and reduced volumes from established and stable help desks 
revenue generated in europe increased to million in  from million in  primarily due to growth in business at our belgian and swedish subsidiaries  our acquisition of ane  and the strengthening of european currencies relative to the us dollar  which were partially offset by the contractual price reduction to ford 
excluding revenue contributed by ane  revenue generated in europe increased to million in  from million in if revenue in europe for was translated at the average exchange rate for  reported revenue would have been reduced by approximately million in within europe  revenue from our belgian operation increased to million in  from million in  primarily due to additional business from new customers  the strengthening of the euro relative to the us dollar  and our acquisition of us excluding revenue contributed by ane  revenue generated from our belgian operation increased to million in  from million in if revenue from our belgian operation in was translated at the average exchange rate for  reported revenue would have been reduced by approximately million in since most of the company s international operating expenses are also incurred in the same foreign currencies in which the associated revenue is denominated  the net impact of exchange rate fluctuations on gross profit and operating income is considerably less than the estimated impact on revenue 
under our services agreement with ford for its global helpdesk  we provide corporate helpdesk services on a fixed price per seat  or managed service  basis 
pursuant to the terms of the contract  we were required to reduce the price of our services on a per seat basis effective august  the agreement also provides for an adjustment to the number of seats that we are compensated for supporting at ford  adjusted up or down and applied prospectively  effective august  we estimate that the combination of these two events resulted in a decrease in revenue in of approximately  to  we expect to offset the majority of the reduction in revenue with continued expansion and growth in the ford global helpdesk 
revenue from the ford global helpdesk in was approximately million greater than revenue from the ford global helpdesk in year ended december  gross gross increase amount margin amount margin decrease change in thousands  except percentages gross profit diversified it outsourcing services

as there are no expected future cash flows related to the customization  we recorded an impairment charge representing the net book value of these costs 
excluding the impairment charge  gross margin from diversified it outsourcing services increased to in  from in this improvement in gross margin was also partially offset by the impact of reductions in revenue under our ford contract  as discussed above 
based on historical trends  we estimate that the combination of a reduced price per seat and the reduced number of seats being supported on our ford contract reduced our gross margin on diversified it outsourcing services by basis points and our overall gross margin by basis points in gross profit from it consulting and systems integration increased to million in  from million in gross margin from it consulting and systems integration decreased to in  from in the increase in gross profit and decrease in gross margin was primarily due to our acquisitions of dsc and ane and lower margin hardware sales of million at these subsidiaries 
excluding the total gross profit contributed by dsc and ane  gross profit increased to million  from million in  and gross margin increased to in  from in  primarily due to additional business from new and existing customers at our subsidiary  techteam cyntergy  which provides deployment  training  and implementation services to companies in the hospitality  retail  food service  and other industries throughout the united states 
the increase in gross profit from government technology services of million to million in  from  in  is attributable primarily to our acquisition of dsc on december  gross margin from government technology services of in was negatively impacted by lower margin hardware sales of million 
excluding these hardware sales  gross margin from government technology services increased to in from in gross profit from technical staffing decreased to million in  from million in  which is consistent with the decrease in technical staffing revenue

excluding revenue and expenses contributed by dsc and ane  selling  general  and administrative expense increased to million  or of total revenue  in  from million  or of total revenue  in expenses have increased to support revenue growth and expansion in romania  but expenses as a percentage of revenue have decreased due to efforts to control costs and reduced amortization expense of  in from  as certain assets have become fully amortized 
under the company s incentive compensation plans that became effective january   certain members of management are entitled to bonuses as a result of our meeting specific revenue and operating income targets for we incurred approximately million of expense under these plans in  of which  was recorded to cost of services delivered 
net interest income decreased to  in  from million in  primarily due to lower average cash balances maintained in  and interest income received in related to a tax refund 
foreign currency transaction gain loss decreased to a loss of  in from a gain of  in  primarily due to the us dollar weakening relative to the euro and british pound sterling to a greater extent in than in and lower foreign denominated balances subject to transaction gains and losses in than in the consolidated effective tax rate in differs from the statutory tax rate of primarily due to the unfavorable tax effect of providing a valuation allowance against the future tax benefit of operating loss carryforwards in certain foreign tax jurisdictions and state income taxes 
these items are partially offset by recognizing a favorable tax benefit from the expected recovery of taxes paid in prior years and a change in estimate regarding the company s tax liabilities for prior years 
in  the consolidated effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the unfavorable tax effect of providing a valuation allowance against the future tax benefit of operating loss carryforwards in certain foreign tax jurisdictions and the existence of nondeductible expenses 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  year ended december  increase decrease change in thousands revenue diversified it outsourcing services    government technology services   it consulting and systems integration 
  technical staffing    learning services  total revenue    revenue from our diversified it outsourcing services increased to million in  from million in  primarily due to increased revenue generated by our european subsidiaries and the strengthening of the euro  british pound sterling  and swedish kroner relative to the us dollar 
these increases were partially offset by a contractual price reduction granted to ford 
revenue from it consulting and systems integration services increased to million in  from million in  primarily due to additional business from existing customers 
revenue from technical staffing services decreased to million in  from million in  primarily due to price concessions granted to ford and staffing reductions  which were partially offset by additional business received from ford in europe 
revenue generated in the united states decreased to million in  from million in the decrease in revenue in the united states was primarily due to a contractual price reduction to ford in our diversified it outsourcing services and technical staffing segments  and a reduction in placements in our technical staffing operating segment with ford 
the price reductions and staffing reductions adversely affected total company revenue by approximately million  with the majority of this effect occurring in the united states 
revenue generated in europe increased to million in  from million in  primarily due to additional business from existing customers in our diversified it outsourcing services segment  efforts to expand our multilingual help desk capabilities in europe  and the weakening of the us dollar relative to the euro and the british pound sterling 
if revenue in europe for was translated at the average exchange rate for  reported revenue would have been reduced by approximately million during since most of the company s international operating expenses are also incurred in the same foreign currencies in which the associated revenue is denominated  the net impact of exchange rate fluctuations on gross profit and operating income is considerably less than the estimated impact on revenue 
within europe  revenue from our belgian operation increased to million in  from million in  due to growth in our existing customer base and the aforementioned weakening of the us dollar relative to the euro 
if revenue in belgium in was translated at the average exchange rate for  reported revenue would have been reduced by approximately million during since most of the company s international operating expenses are also incurred in the same foreign currencies in which the associated revenue is denominated  the net impact of exchange rate fluctuations on gross profit and operating income is considerably less than the estimated impact on revenue

on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  pursuant to which we no longer amortize goodwill beginning in  but are required to subject goodwill to an annual impairment test  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
upon adoption of sfas  we performed an impairment test of goodwill as of january  we first compared the estimated fair value of each reporting unit  as that term is defined by sfas  with the reporting unit s carrying amount 
the fair values of the reporting units were estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows 
upon completing this first step  we identified our leasing operations reporting segment whose carrying amount exceeded the fair value 
as a result  we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of million representing the remaining carrying value of this goodwill  which was recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change as of january  the goodwill related to our leasing operations segment and became impaired primarily due to our decision to exit the leasing business and a significant decline in the fair market value of the leased equipment in the secondary market 
impact of business with major clients as set forth in item business  we have historically been heavily dependent upon two or three major clients for a substantial portion of our revenue 
in  ford motor company was our only client to exceed the threshold for being reported as a significant customer 
for the three years ended december    and ford accounted for   and  respectively  of the company s total revenue 
any loss of or failure to retain a significant amount of business with ford would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and liquidity 
revenue generated through our business with ford increased from million in to million in and to million in our business with ford consists of helpdesk services discussed above  technical staffing  installation of new personal computer equipment through dell inc  and the support services provided to volvo car corporation  a subsidiary of ford motor company 
we anticipate that that our revenue from ford will continue to grow during our largest contract with ford for its global helpdesk is scheduled to expire on july  while we believe that we are well positioned to win this renewal due to our strong performance  there can be no assurance in this regard 
during  our revenue generated from business with daimlerchrysler ag accounted for less than of our total revenue for the three years ended december    and  daimlerchrysler accounted for   and  respectively  of the company s total revenue 
the decline in business from daimlerchrysler is due in part to a significant decline in revenue generated from daimlerchrysler through our leasing unit  and to the reduction in size of the daimlerchrysler dealership helpdesk during as previously announced  the dealership helpdesk contract was awarded to another vendor in november accordingly  while we continue to provide daimlerchrysler with training  technical staffing  and other helpdesk services  daimlerchrysler is not expected to exceed the threshold for being reported as a significant customer in the company continues to seek to diversify its client base from both a client and industry perspective 
during  we were successful in expanding our non ford related business  especially through our multilingual helpdesk offering and the results from our acquisitions of techteam ane and dsc 
we expect further diversification in as a result of our acquisition of sytel  inc while a major facet of our business strategy for remains to diversify our customer base and become less dependent on our business with ford  we believe our strong performance and relationship with ford will continue to result in increasing revenue dollars while the percentage of our total revenue derived from ford declines  although no assurances can be given in this regard 
new accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which replaces sfas and supersedes apb sfas r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
sfas r is effective for the company for awards that are granted  modified  or settled in periods beginning after june   or the company s third quarter 
as we use the fair value method of accounting under the original provisions of sfas for pro forma disclosure purposes  we are also required to apply the provisions of sfas r in recognizing compensation cost for any portion of awards granted or modified after december   that are not yet vested at the date sfas r is adopted 
based on the number of non vested stock options the company has outstanding at december   adoption of sfas r will result in approximately  of compensation expense  net of tax  in and will not have a material affect on our financial position or operating results 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million at december   as compared to million at december  cash and cash equivalents increased million in primarily due to million in cash provided by continuing operations  million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options  and cash provided by discontinued operations of  which were partially offset by million in cash used to repurchase  shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program   in cash used to acquire ane   in cash used to pay expenses related to our acquisition of dsc  million in cash used for capital expenditures  and  in payments on long term debt  primarily related to notes payable acquired in our acquisitions of dsc and ane our operating cash flow of million in was generated primarily by income prior to non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million  and million of operating cash flow from our discontinued operation 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million in to million at december   from million at december   primarily due to million in cash used to acquire dsc  million in cash used to repurchase  shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs  million in cash used for capital expenditures  and  in payments on long term debt of capital group 
these decreases were partially offset by million in cash provided by operations  million in proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock   in proceeds from the exercise of stock options  and million in proceeds from the sale of marketable securities 
operating cash flow of million in and million in included million and million of operating cash flow from capital group  our discontinued operation 
capital expenditures were million in  million in  and million in the increase in capital spending in as compared to and was the result of our expansion in europe and continued investment in newer technologies and infrastructure support 
we expect our capital expenditures in to be at a comparable level to our average for the three year period ending december  long term cash requirements  other than for normal operating expenses  are currently anticipated for continued expansion in europe  enhancements of existing technologies  possible repurchases of our common stock  additional consideration that is payable to the selling shareholders of dsc and ane if specific performance conditions and operating targets are met in  possible global expansion activities  the possible payment of company dividends  and the possible acquisition of businesses complementary to the company s existing business 
we believe that positive cash flows from operations  together with existing cash balances  will be sufficient to meet our ongoing requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  and possible stock repurchases for the next twelve months 
we have historically not paid dividends 
material commitments the company has the following contractual obligations outstanding at december redeemable convertible preferred operating maturities of contractual obligations debt stock leases less than one year  years   years  thereafter  total   subsequent to year end on january   we borrowed million under a term loan with a bank due january  to finance our acquisition of sytel  inc critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
under gaap  we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements 
as additional information becomes available  these estimates and assumptions can change and impact amounts reported in the future 
we have identified below accounting policies that we use to make these estimates and assumptions 
we consider these policies critical due to the amount of judgment uncertainty inherent in their application 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes represent temporary differences in the recognition of certain items for income tax and financial reporting purposes 
realization of deferred tax assets depends upon sufficient levels of future taxable income 
if at any time we believe that current or future taxable income does not support the realization of deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance is provided 
based on historical losses in belgium and romania  we have provided a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to our net operating loss carryforward in these countries 
we anticipate providing a valuation allowance for any future losses incurred in belgium and romania 
no valuation allowance has been recognized against other deferred tax assets  which are in the united states  as we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized based on estimates of future taxable income  which have considered  among other factors  the future benefits of our recent acquisitions 
no provision has been made with respect to approximately million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries at december   since we have typically considered these earnings to be permanently reinvested 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of  which provides guidance under sfas  accounting for income taxes  with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of jobs act on an enterprise s income tax expense and deferred taxes 
the jobs act was enacted on october  fsp states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the jobs act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas we have not yet evaluated the impact of the repatriation provisions 
accordingly  as provided for in fsp  we have not adjusted income tax expense or deferred taxes to reflect the repatriation provisions of the jobs act 
accounts receivable we periodically review our accounts receivable balances for collectibility based on a combination of historical experience and existing economic conditions 
the definition of delinquent accounts is based on the governing contractual terms 
delinquent accounts and balances are reserved when we determine they are more likely than not to become uncollectible 
our customers are generally large  well capitalized entities 
we generally do not require collateral and do not charge interest on past due balances 
our experience with delinquent accounts was adversely impacted by the bankruptcy of three customers in the third and fourth quarters of  which continue to reflect the challenging economic conditions of our industry 
one customer was a former reseller of our leased equipment  one customer was related to our corporate help desk services segment  and one customer was indebted to the company as a result of a note receivable acquired with our acquisition of certain assets of cyntergy corporation in we are not aware of major financial difficulties at any major customer and do not anticipate large uncollectible accounts in the future 
factors influencing future results because of the following factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results which are not set forth below  past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance  and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
impact of business with major clients as set forth in item business  we continue to depend upon ford and its subsidiaries for a substantial portion of our revenue 
the past three years have been difficult financially for this client  and further deterioration of its financial condition could have a material adverse impact on our business as they may seek further price concessions or the termination of projects 
similarly  the loss of any significant customer or a reduction in economic activity in the automotive industry would have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our two largest contracts  the ford global helpdesk contract currently scheduled to expire on july  and a contract with a division of the department of defense currently scheduled to expire on march   are both up for renewal during while we believe that we are well positioned due to our strong performance to win these significant renewals  there can be no assurance in this regard 
the existence of significant competition we face intense competition in all of our markets and for all of our services 
many competitors have substantially greater resources  including more locations  greater financial resources  a larger client base  and greater name and brand recognition 
these competitors may be willing to provide the same services that we do at a loss in order to attain other  more lucrative business from our customers 
due to this competition  it may be difficult for us to retain our current customers or grow our revenue outside of our current customer base 
the intense competition may result in our customers being able to demand reduced pricing in order for us to remain a preferred vendor 
these pressures will likely increase due to the trend to move outsourcing services offshore to countries with lower labor costs  such as india  malaysia  and the philippines 
our inability to continue to execute upon our strategy to address the globalization of the support services market could have a material adverse impact on our ability to maintain and grow our customer base 
further  we may have to continue to lower the prices of our services to stay competitive  while at the same time trying to maintain or improve revenue and gross margin 
if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures  our gross margin and therefore our profitability could be adversely affected 
any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
moreover  the process to win new business tends to be long 
our diversified it outsourcing services business models require significant changes to our customer s business processes and each customer has significant internal political difficulties with local environments giving up decentralized control of the support function 
the decision makers are rarely involved in the early details of the selection process so there are multiple sales efforts to the team charged with selection and then to the chief information officer chief executive officer board that have to occur 
our results are dependent on our ability to successfully manage the sales process and strong competition in these markets 
contract risks inherent in our business the great majority of our contracts  including our ford global helpdesk contract  may be terminated without cause on short notice  often upon as little as days notice 
terminations and non renewals of major contracts could have a material adverse impact upon our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
a portion of our diversified it outsourcing services business is billed on a managed service basis where the fee is fixed to perform specified services as opposed to time and materials 
the onset of problems in our customers infrastructure  such as computer viruses  may require us to deploy additional resources to solve these problems 
in many instances  we would not receive any additional revenue for the work performed  thereby adversely impacting our profitability 
to the extent we provide service on a per incident or per minute basis  our financial performance is dependent upon the volume of service requests that we receive on the project 
some of our contracts do not contain minimum guaranteed volume  so we may not always receive enough volume to pay for our costs relating to a specific contract 
also  many of our contracts contain financial penalties for our failure to meet the contractual performance service levels 
if the volume is too high  we may not be able to meet the service levels 
in the united states  we are able to manage this risk through changes in our staffing  but due to labor laws  our european entities do not have as much flexibility in staffing 
our inability to estimate accurately the resources and related expenses required for the managed service project or our failure to complete our contractual obligations in a manner consistent with their terms could materially and adversely affect the business 
risks inherent in government technology services we derive an increasing amount of our revenues from government contracts that typically are awarded through competitive processes and span a one year base period and one or more option years 
the unexpected termination or non renewal of one or more of our significant contracts could result in significant revenue shortfalls 
our clients generally have the right not to exercise the option periods 
in addition  our contracts typically contain provisions permitting an agency to terminate the contract on short notice  with or without cause 
following the expiration of the contract term  if the client requires further services of the type provided in the contract  there is frequently a competitive re bidding process 
we may not win any particular re bid or be able to successfully bid on new contracts to replace those that have been terminated 
many of the systems we support involve managing and protecting information involved in the department of defense and other sensitive government functions 
a security breach in one of these systems could cause serious harm to our business  could result in negative publicity and could prevent us from having further access to such critically sensitive systems or other similarly sensitive areas for other governmental clients 
losses that we could incur from such a security breach could exceed the policy limits that we have for errors and omissions insurance 
some of our government contracts require us  and some of our employees  to maintain security clearances 
if we lose or are unable to obtain security clearances  the client can terminate the contract or decide not to renew it upon its expiration 
as a result  to the extent we cannot obtain the required security clearances for our employees working on a particular engagement  we may not derive the revenue anticipated from the engagement  which  if not replaced with revenue from other engagements  could negatively impact our operating results 
federal government agencies routinely audit government contracts 
these agencies review a contractor s performance on its contract  pricing practices  cost structure and compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
an audit could result in an adjustment to our revenues because any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed  while improper costs already reimbursed must be refunded 
if a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with federal government agencies 
in addition  we could suffer harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety were made against us 
we must comply with and are affected by federal government regulations relating to the formation  administration  and performance of government contracts 
these regulations affect how we do business with our clients and may impose added costs on our business 
any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in contract termination  price or fee reductions or suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government 
further  the federal government may reform its procurement practices or adopt new contracting methods relating to the gsa schedule or other government wide contract vehicles 
to the extent that we are unable to successfully comply with these regulations  our government technology services business could be negatively impacted 
reliance on senior management the success of the company is highly dependent upon the efforts  direction  and guidance of its senior management 
the only employment agreements that we currently have with the executive officers of the company are with the president and chief executive officer  the vice president sales and marketing  emea  the president and chief executive officer of digital support corporation  and the president and chief executive officer of sytel  inc except for employment agreements relating to a change of control  which only apply to a change in the control of the company  we do not have any other employment agreements with other members of our executive officer team 
the loss of any of these senior executives or our inability to attract  retain  or replace key management personnel in the future  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
attraction and retention of employees our business involves the delivery of professional services and is very labor intensive 
our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract  develop  motivate  and retain highly skilled technical  clerical  and administrative employees 
qualified personnel  especially in washington  dc  are in high demand 
accordingly  we expect to experience increased compensation costs that may not be offset through either increased productivity or higher customer pricing 
moreover  no assurances can be given that we will be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees in the future  especially when we need to expand our services in a short time period 
we attempt to implement a career path model where our helpdesks are located  thereby enabling our employees to move to new jobs that require higher skill levels and pay more money 
our inability to effectively implement this business model in these locations could negatively affect our employee retention rates 
our failure to attract and retain employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
management of growth by acquisition our business strategy includes seeking to make complementary business acquisitions 
in order to pursue a growth by acquisition strategy successfully  we must identify suitable candidates for these transactions  complete these transactions  and manage post closing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or their employees 
integration issues are complex  time consuming and expensive and  without proper planning and implementation  could significantly disrupt our business  including  but not limited to  the diversion of management s attention  the loss of key business and or personnel from the acquired company  unanticipated events  legal liabilities  dilutive effect of the issuance of additional securities  and amortization of intangibles 
moreover  the financial risks continue after the integration of the company 
if the business becomes impaired  there could be a non cash partial or full write off of the goodwill attributed to the acquisition 
transactions may result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings  including those related to severance pay  early retirement costs  employee benefit costs  asset impairment charges  charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts  in process research and development charges  inventory adjustments  legal  accounting and financial advisory fees  and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans 
any of these possible difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
risks associated with international operations we operate businesses in many countries outside the united states  all of which are currently located throughout europe 
as part of our business strategy  we plan to further expand our global reach to be able to deliver services from asia and south america 
as a result  we expect to continue expansion through start up operations and acquisitions in additional countries 
expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional countries will require management attention and financial resources 
our future revenue  gross margin  expenses  and financial condition also could suffer due to a variety of international factors  including the following changes in a country s or region s economic or political conditions  including inflation  recession  interest rate fluctuations  and unanticipated military conflicts  currency fluctuations  particularly in the euro  which contribute to variations in sales of services in impacted jurisdictions and also affect our reported results expressed in us dollars  longer accounts receivable cycles and financial instability among customers  local labor conditions and regulations  differences in cultures and languages  which impair our ability to work as an effective global team  differing political and social systems  changes in the regulatory or legal environment  differing technology standards or customer requirements  difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax efficient manner and changes in tax laws  natural and medical disasters 
to the extent that the company does not manage its international operations successfully  its business could be adversely affected and its revenues or earnings could be reduced 
in addition  there has been an increasing amount of political discussion and debate related to worldwide outsourcing  particularly from the united states to offshore locations 
while there is federal and state legislation currently pending related to this issue  it is too early to determine whether such legislation  if enacted  would have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
risks in offshore markets the industry trend to move business towards offshore markets could result in excess operating capacity in the united states  thereby increasing competition for customers 
moreover  there are no assurances that we will be able to successfully expand into and conduct business in offshore markets 
the success of any offshore operation is subject to numerous contingencies  some of which are beyond management control  including general and regional economic conditions  prices for our services  competition  changes in regulation  and other risks 
any failure in our strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
see risks associated with international operations 
our customers are primarily attracted to a reduction in cost of our services as a result of delivery from an offshore location  and they are looking to enter into long term contracts to provide monthly services with a price that does not adjust significantly with inflation 
when a number of service providers enter these offshore locations  the competition for employees increases  causing turnover and increasing labor costs 
in these circumstances  the company bears the risk of inflation  which could result in our costs increasing faster than we can improve technician productivity 
currency fluctuations we serve an increasing number of our us based customers using helpdesks in europe 
some of these contracts are priced in us dollars  while a substantial portion of our costs are incurred in romanian lei or the euro 
thus  we are subject to a foreign currency exchange risk 
although we enter into contracts to limit potential foreign currency exposure  the company does not fully hedge this exposure 
as a result  our gross profit may be reduced on these contracts 
management of capacity and projects the company s ability to profit from the global trend toward outsourcing depends in part on how effectively it manages its helpdesk capacity 
there are several factors and trends that have intensified the challenge of resource management 
in order to create the additional capacity necessary to accommodate new or expanded outsourcing projects  the company must consider opening new helpdesk facilities 
the opening or expansion of a helpdesk facility may result  at least in the short term  in idle capacity until any new or expanded program is implemented fully 
the company periodically assesses the expected long term capacity utilization of its helpdesk facilities 
as a result  it may  if deemed necessary  consolidate  close or partially close under performing helpdesk facilities in order to maintain or improve targeted utilization and margins 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve or maintain optimal utilization of its helpdesk capacity 
if the company does not effectively manage its capacity  its results of operations could be adversely affected 
with the inclusion of our romanian helpdesk facility  we have significantly increased the amount of business that we are performing for the same customers from more than one location 
multi site delivery increases the complexity of the service provided  including but not limited to managing call volume and resources 
the inability of the company to manage the different cultures and personnel to deliver consistent quality from different sites could reduce the company s profitability and results of operation 
technological changes  dependence on technology  interruption of telecommunications our success depends in part on our ability to develop it solutions that keep pace with continuing changes in the it industry  evolving industry standards  and changing client preferences 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in adequately addressing these developments on a timely basis or that  if these developments are addressed  we will be successful in the marketplace 
for example  our support portal offering is comprised of our proprietary incident management tool and software developed and sold by software companies 
we have integrated this software into the support portal 
during this time  there have been other tools developed by other competitors and software vendors that can match the functionality of the support portal 
if these other tools can provide similar or better functionality at a lower effective cost  or if our software vendors go out of business  we could have a product and service offering that will lose its marketability 
the cost to update our incident management tool and change the third party software comprising the support portal could be significant 
our inability to effectively keep pace with continuing changes in the it industry could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
moreover  experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security  or that of our customers  and misappropriate our confidential information  create system disruptions  or cause shutdowns 
as a result  we could incur significant expenses in addressing problems created by security breaches of our network 
moreover  we could lose existing or potential customers for information technology outsourcing services or other information technology solutions  or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers system failures 
in addition  sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design and manufacture  including bugs and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of our systems 
the costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems  viruses  worms  and bugs could be significant  and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions  delays  or cessation of service 
our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our helpdesk facility and our information databases against damages that may be caused by fire and other disasters  power failure  telecommunications failures  unauthorized intrusion  computer viruses  and other emergencies 
the temporary or permanent loss of such systems could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
notwithstanding precautions we have taken to protect ourselves and our clients from events that could interrupt delivery of our services  there can be no assurance that a fire  natural disaster  human error  equipment malfunction or inadequacy  computer virus  firewall breach  or other event would not result in a prolonged interruption in our ability to provide support services to our clients 
as we commence delivering services from an offshore location  the risks attendant to interruption of telecommunications increase 
any interruption to our data or voice telecommunications networks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and our results of operations 
economic weakness our revenue and gross profit depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for our services in the markets in which we compete 
softened demand for our services caused by economic weakness and constrained information technology spending over the past several years has resulted  and may result in the future  in decreased revenue  gross profit  earnings  or growth rates and problems with our ability to realize customer receivables 
in addition  customer financial difficulties have resulted  and could in the future result  in increases in bad debt write offs and additions to reserves in our receivables portfolio 
uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments 
further delays or reductions in information technology spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and consequently our results of operations  prospects  and stock price 
health care and other benefit costs health care and other benefit costs continue to increase 
our business is labor intensive  and therefore we have exposure to these increasing healthcare benefit costs 
while we attempt to compensate for these escalating costs in our business cost models and customer pricing and have passed along some of these increased costs to our employees  we have long term  generally fixed price pricing agreements with our customers 
terrorism terrorist acts or acts of war wherever located around the world may cause damage or disruption to techteam  our employees  facilities  partners  suppliers  distributors  resellers  or customers  which could adversely impact our revenue  costs and expenses  and financial condition 
limited protection of proprietary systems and procedures we rely upon a combination of nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and trade secrets  copyright  and trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights and the proprietary rights of third parties from whom we license intellectual property 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  customers  and suppliers and limit distribution of proprietary information 
there can be no assurance  however  that the steps taken by us in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use of such information and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
although we believe our services and or software do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others and that we have all of the rights necessary to utilize the intellectual property employed in our business  we are subject to the risk of litigation alleging infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
any such claims could require us to spend significant sums of money in litigation  pay damages  develop non infringing intellectual property  or acquire licenses of the intellectual property  which may be the subject of asserted infringement 
volatility of stock price the market price of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range during the past several years and may continue to do so in the future 
see item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors or events  including  among other things  the depth and liquidity of the trading market for our common stock  public float in our common stock  quarterly variations in our operating results  actual versus anticipated operating results  growth rates  market conditions in the industry in which we compete  announcements by competitors  regulatory actions  litigation including class action litigation  and general economic conditions 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of the stocks of technology companies 
as a result of the foregoing  our operating results and future prospects at various times may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
any such event could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are subject to market exposure from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not have any material market risk related to interest rates as our debt obligations have fixed interest rates and short lives 
we are subject to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to our global operations as we provide services in the united states and europe 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets in which we provide services 
our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and european currencies  specifically the euro  british pound sterling  swedish kroner  and romanian lei 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the statements of operations of our international subsidiaries into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
we do not hedge operating translation risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally 
at december  and  our net current assets defined as current assets less current liabilities subject to foreign currency translation risk were million and million  respectively 
the potential decrease in net current assets from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be million and  at december  and  respectively 
the sensitivity analysis presented assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates yet exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
this assumption may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on individual assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
certain of our trade receivables at our international subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the techteam entities that deliver the service 
in december  we entered into a foreign currency option contract to manage the company s exposure to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and euro 
under the option contract  we may sell an aggregate of  notional amount in monthly transactions  at our option  and purchase euros at a fixed exchange rate 
the fair value of the option contract was  at december   which represents the difference between the exchange rate at december  and the fixed rate in the contract applied to the notional amount 
we do not enter into derivatives or similar instruments for trading or speculative purposes
