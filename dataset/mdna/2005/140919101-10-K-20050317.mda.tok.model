item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
historical results and percentage relationships among accounts are not necessarily an indication of trends in operating results for any future period 
in these discussions  most percentages and dollar amounts have been rounded to aid presentation 
as a result  all such figures are approximations 
overview we are engaged in the business of issuing title insurance policies  performing other title related services  such as escrow activities and performing valuation services in connection with real estate transactions 
we operate through approximately offices located in arizona  california  nevada  ohio  pennsylvania and texas and employ over  individuals 
our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses our key performance indicators revenue  net income and non gaap  non financial performance indicators opened orders  closed orders  average revenue per closed order  as well as the trends and uncertainties affecting our industry and markets and analyzes our liquidity and capital resources 
while management believes the key performance indicators of revenue and net income are the best indicators of the company s financial and operating performance  the non gaap  non financial performance indicators may also provide management with additional insight into the volume of transactions and trend in operating performance for the company s traditional title and escrow services 
we operate through two reportable segments which are title and escrow services and lender services 
our title and escrow services segment consists of wholly owned title insurance agencies  a title insurance underwriter and parent holding company operations  including issuance and repayment of corporate debt obligations 
the significant subsidiaries within this segment includes capital title agency  first california title company  land title of nevada  new century title company  united capital title insurance company and united title company 
this segment generates its revenue principally from issuing title insurance policies and providing escrow services for residential and commercial real estate transactions  services which are typically marketed to real estate agents  community banks and regional lenders in selected local markets 
our lender services segment encompasses our bundled services strategy  which currently includes real estate appraisal and valuation services  title insurance and escrow related services and flood zone determination services which are marketed to regional and national lenders and mortgage brokers 
the significant subsidiaries within this segment include nationwide appraisal services corporation  nationwide totalflood and real estate appraisal services  inc unlike our traditional title and escrow services division  this segment typically conducts its business on a national scope from centralized processing centers 
this segment generates its revenue principally from providing appraisal and valuation services  issuing title insurance policies  providing escrow services and flood zone determination services primarily for lenders involved in residential real estate transactions 
we reported net income of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company experienced a decline in net income during resulting primarily from an increase in the mix of business toward our traditional title and escrow operations in california where we experience historically lower margins due to the highly competitive market within california 
additionally  we did not achieve anticipated margins in our lender services segment primarily resulting from short term transition and integration costs subsequent to the acquisition of nationwide and totalflood 
despite the decline in net income  we did post earnings that reflected the continued strong residential real estate market during and the additional operations acquired during the operations acquired during provided million of pre tax earnings to consolidated results 
our revenue from title insurance  escrow and related real estate services is primarily from three sources residential resale  lender refinance and commercial real estate transactions 
we typically recognize revenue for the services we perform when the corresponding real estate transaction closes 
in the case of revenue from the flood zone determination services we provide  we defer a portion of revenue that relates to services we are contractually required provide in future periods 
this deferred revenue is reflected in other liabilities on our balance sheet at december  typically  we receive payment for our services at the time the related real estate transaction closes 
in some cases  we bill for services provided  principally related to our lender services business  and collect the accounts receivable at a later date 
during fiscal  we anticipate that refinance transactions will decline from record levels experienced in and  which we expect will result in a decrease in our revenues and profits from existing operations 
while we believe mortgage interest rates will begin to rise during  we do not anticipate a dramatic increase  so when coupled with a strong economy  we believe this will continue to provide an attractive environment for residential resales and new home purchases 
additionally  as synergies continue to develop between our lender services operations and our traditional title and escrow operations  we believe there is opportunity for profitable growth 
however  despite these potentially positive factors  we continue to believe maintaining operating flexibility in and beyond is imperative 
the cyclical nature of the mortgage industry  and hence the title insurance and settlement services industry  requires us to tightly manage operating expense levels in response to market fluctuations 
larger than anticipated declines in revenue or the inability to maintain costs could result in a decline in profitability or future operating losses 
application of critical accounting policies we believe that the estimates and assumptions that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations require us to make difficult  subjective and complex judgments  which form the basis for our critical accounting policies 
our most critical accounting policies relate to reserves for title insurance and escrow losses  related contingencies and litigation surrounding title and escrow losses and impairment of intangible assets and long lived assets 
reserves for title insurance and escrow losses when evaluating title insurance and escrow losses we estimate reserves for known claims as well as a provision for incurred but not reported losses based on several factors including  but not limited to  historical loss experience  and the current industry and legal environments 
settlement of claims for known  as well as incurred but not reported losses  for amounts greater than what has been provided for in these financial statements would require additional provision in future periods 
contingencies and litigation contingencies and litigation are reviewed by us on an ongoing basis and  in conjunction with legal counsel  determinations are made as to the outcome of any lawsuits and advice of claims 
based on this assessment  any required reserves are reflected in our financial statements 
to the extent a litigation claim or other contingency is settled for an amount greater than or less than what was anticipated  the difference would be reflected in a future period 
impairment of intangible assets we perform a test of each reporting unit for which goodwill is attributed to evaluate for any impairment of intangible assets at least annually 
this includes  among other things  a review of events or circumstances which would indicate an impairment of goodwill 
as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we completed an annual goodwill impairment test on its reporting units and have determined that each of our reporting units have a fair value in excess of its carrying value 
accordingly  no goodwill impairment has been recorded 
future losses from reporting units to which goodwill is attributed may lead to an impairment charge in future periods 
we believe estimates and assumptions related to these critical accounting policies are appropriate under the circumstances  however  should future events or occurrences result in unanticipated consequences  there could be a material impact on our future financial condition or results of operations 
transactions affecting comparability of results of operations in july of  we acquired dpsi  since renamed nationwide totalflood 
totalflood  through a centralized processing center located in los angeles  california  is a provider of residential and commercial flood determinations on property throughout the united states 
the transaction included payment of million in cash for the total amount of the purchase price 
in may of  we acquired nationwide appraisal  which provides appraisal  title and settlement services to its customers in the mortgage and real estate industry through its centralized processing center near pittsburgh  pennsylvania 
the transaction included a million payment of cash and calls for an additional million of payments which is planned to be made in march we also acquired the assets of real estate appraisal services  inc in november for million in a combination of million in cash and million in a one year note payable bearing interest of 
included in the results of operations during was revenue of approximately million and pre tax income of million related to the aforementioned operations 
in january  we acquired land title of nevada  inc the acquisition marked our entrance into the las vegas  nevada market  adding five branch offices and employees 
the transaction included payment of million in cash and issuance of a million  five year note to the seller for a total purchase price of approximately million 
included in the results of operations during was revenue of approximately million and pre tax income of million related to the acquisition of land title of nevada  inc in september  we acquired nations holding group  including its wholly owned subsidiaries united title company  first california title company and united capital title insurance company 
the acquisition significantly increased our presence in california and enabled us to internally underwrite the vast majority of all title insurance policies that we issued in this acquisition has significantly improved the profitability of our existing operations because we no longer have to share all title insurance premiums with third party underwriters on transactions for which we issue and underwrite title insurance policies 
the purchase price  including direct transaction costs  was approximately million  which consisted of million in cash and million in redeemable preferred stock 
as part of the purchase we also issued warrants  valued at  to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the redeemable preferred stock includes an cumulative dividend  payable quarterly  and is redeemable after september at a redemption value of million 
a seven year term loan provided million to assist in the financing of the cash portion of the purchase price 
the term loan  which had a balance of million at december   currently bears interest at a fixed rate of 
we funded the remaining cash portion of the purchase price from our working capital 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the components of our revenue and expenses and such income statement data expressed as a percentage of total revenue in thousands  except segment statistics year ended december  operating data title service revenue  net escrow and related fees appraisal service revenue other income personnel costs rent interest expense provision for title insurance and escrow losses contract service fees other operating expenses income before income taxes income tax expense net income title and escrow services segment statistics opened orders closed orders average revenue per closed order fiscal compared to fiscal our revenue  which is reported net of underwriting fees paid to third party title insurance underwriters  increased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period ended december  operations acquired during contributed million of the increase in revenue for the year ended december  compared to the remaining million of the increase was primarily the result of strong demand for title insurance and related services  fueled by a strong housing market resulting from the low mortgage interest rate environment during  as well as an increase in the average revenue per closed order and an increase in investment income due to improved investment returns and higher investment balances during the decrease in opened and closed orders during the year ended december  was the result of a decline in residential mortgage refinancings during compared to the prior year 
the increase in average revenue per closed order reflects the increase in business mix in favor of residential resale transactions  which typically garner higher revenue per order  as well as an increase in property values  which is a main driver of the revenue we charge for a transaction 
as a result of anticipated changes in the interest rate environment in  and the impact that it will have on the demand for our services  we expect a decline in opened orders in compared to in our traditional title and escrow operations  resulting in a decrease in title and escrow related revenue 
potential increases in market share and our lender services segment may partially offset this anticipated decrease 
the significant components of other income include interest income from invested cash balances and fixed maturity bonds  investment dividends  revenue from servicing seller financed mortgages and revenue from flood zone determinations services 
other income increased as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  to from compared to the prior year

rent expense increased as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  to from for the prior year 
the increase in relation to revenue is primarily related to the expansion of branches in southern california during the year 
our growth in recent years in this market necessitated an increase in office space to accommodate current and anticipated future space requirements 
rent expense overall is higher in compared to  resulting from additional office locations which were acquired during  as previously discussed 
interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  primarily resulting from additional debt obtained during to assist with the financing of the nationwide appraisal acquisition 
provision for title insurance and escrow losses decreased as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  to from for the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to favorable claim experience in both our traditional title and escrow agency operations and insurance underwriting operation 
in addition  this percentage is expected to decline in as we increase revenue from our appraisal and real estate settlement services  which have no provision for such losses 
contract service fees is a new classification line item in our financial statements resulting from the acquisition of nationwide 
this line item relates to fees paid to third party appraisers and abstractors who conduct valuation services and title searches throughout the united states 
this expense is variable in relation to the volume of business generated by nationwide s operations 
the significant components of other operating expenses include title plant maintenance and access  supplies  utilities  insurance  allowance for bad debt  depreciation  delivery and professional fees 
other operating expenses increased million  or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
the increase is the result of several costs in this category that vary directly with our volume of business such as title plant and other data purchased from third parties  supplies and delivery expense 
additionally  we experienced an increase in costs related to title plant and other data purchased from third parties  which are typically variable in relation to revenue  but these contractual costs rose in relation to the prior year

we experienced a slight decline in the average revenue per closed order during compared to the prior year reflecting the increase in business mix toward refinance transactions  which typically carry lower revenue in comparison to residential resale and commercial real estate transactions 
the significant components of other income include interest income from invested cash balances and fixed maturity bonds  investment dividends and revenue from servicing seller financed mortgages

operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year

rent expense decreased as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  to from for the prior year

rent expense overall is higher in compared to  resulting from additional office locations which were acquired during and early  as previously discussed

the increase was primarily due to the inclusion of united title insurance company  a title insurance underwriter  in operating results as a result of the nations holding group acquisition 
prior to this acquisition  our provision related solely to escrow losses  and title losses that were generally limited to a  deductible per claim 
however  for policies underwritten by united capital title insurance company  we were typically responsible for up to  per claim

other operating expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenue to for the year ended december  from for the prior year

during the year ended december   we financed our operating  business development and acquisition activities through the use of cash on hand  operating cash flows  debt borrowings and a private placement of our common stock 
the details of our debt borrowings and private placement of common stock are further discussed below 
in april  we completed a private placement of million shares of common stock to select qualified institutional and other investors at a price of per share 
we also granted to the investors and placement agents warrants to acquire an aggregate  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  exercisable for a period of five years 
the net proceeds from the private placement of common stock were million and were used to finance a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of nationwide in april in april  we acquired nationwide 
under the terms of the acquisition  approved by the board of directors for each company  we paid million in cash at closing  with million in deferred cash consideration payable if certain conditions are satisfied after the closing of the transaction 
we paid for this acquisition through a combination of cash on hand  proceeds from the private placement of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock  and proceeds from a million credit facility with comerica bank 
the comerica bank credit facility included a loan in the amount of million bearing interest at a fixed rate of 
under the terms of the comerica bank credit facility we made a million payment of principal on september  the remaining million balance outstanding under the comerica bank credit facility is being amortized over a five year period with monthly payments of approximately  plus interest and had an outstanding balance of million at december  during  it was determined that million of the deferred cash consideration will not become payable as certain conditions surrounding milestones related to development of software were not met as previously required under terms of the agreement 
only million of the contingent consideration discussed above has been earned and this amount will be paid in march in july we acquired determination processing services  inc  subsequently renamed nationwide totalflood 
under the terms of the acquisition  approved by the board of directors for each company  the purchase price was million 
the purchase price was financed by cash on hand 
in november  we acquired substantially all of the assets of real estate appraisal services  inc under the terms of the asset purchase agreement  approved by the board of directors for each company  the purchase price was million 
the purchase price was financed by million in cash and million in a seller financed note with a one year term bearing interest 
our board of directors declared quarterly cash dividends totaling per common share during we paid a cash dividend totaling million on january  to stockholders of record at the close of business on december  this common dividend payable was reflected in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet at december  we intend to continue paying a comparable quarterly cash dividend on our common stock 
however  the payment of dividends depends entirely upon a decision by our board of directors and may be discontinued at any time  for any reason 
further  under delaware corporate law  in the absence of current or retained earnings  we may be prohibited from paying dividends  whether in cash or otherwise 
we have two million revolving lines of credit 
outstanding borrowings bear interest at the prime rate at december  
at december   there were no borrowings under either of these credit facilities 
there is million committed against one of the credit lines for standby letters of credit pursuant to office leases and an insurance policy 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended december  compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of million during the year ended december  the decrease in cash provided is the result of an increase in accounts receivable  reflecting less earnings being converted directly to cash during additionally  the decrease in net income also impacted operating cash flow during the significant non operating uses of cash for the year ended december  included the purchase of nationwide appraisal and nationwide totalflood  the purchase of additional property and equipment related to expansion of new offices in our traditional title and escrow operations and net investment activity related to purchases of equity securities and fixed maturity bonds 
additionally  we invested million in a partnership that will own an office building in washington  pennsylvania that will house nationwide s centralized processing center and administration 
the company s primary financing activities included debt borrowings and issuance of common stock to assist in the financing of acquisition activity in  and have included repayment of million toward outstanding debt 
our title insurance underwriter  united capital title insurance company  is subject to regulations that limit its ability to pay dividends or make loans or advances to its parent  principally for the protection of policyholders 
generally  the total amount of dividends and distributions is limited to the greater of of united capital title insurance company s surplus  which amount was million as of december   or of net income  which was million  for the year period ended december   provided that the amount does not exceed united capital title insurance company s earned surplus 
under these restrictions  united capital title insurance company could pay  to its parent  dividends of million during without prior regulatory approval 
of our million in cash and cash equivalents at december   million relates to united capital title insurance company and would be subject to the aforementioned restrictions 
of our million investment portfolio  consisting of short term investments  fixed maturity bonds and equity securities  million related to united capital title insurance company and would be subject to the aforementioned restrictions 
a significant component of personnel expense includes incentive bonuses  which are earned by employees during the year  a significant portion of which is paid after the end of the year 
at december   we had approximately million accrued for incentive bonuses that we intend to pay during the first quarter we believe that cash on hand  anticipated future cash receipts and borrowings available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our operating plans and to pay all obligations as they become due for the next twelve months 
seasonality and quarterly results historically  residential real estate activity has been generally slower in late autumn and winter  when fewer families move  buy or sell homes  with increased volume in the spring  summer and early autumn 
residential refinancing activity is generally more uniform throughout the year  subject to interest rate stability 
demand for our title insurance and related settlement services generally tracks these seasonal demand patterns of the residential real estate market  although acquisitions of other title insurance and related settlement service companies and changes in interest rates may alter these traditional seasonal demand patterns 
we typically report our lowest revenue and earnings in the first quarter  with revenue and earnings increasing into the second quarter and through the third quarter and declining again in the fourth quarter 
operating results for the first quarter of  which we anticipate will be profitable  will be negatively impacted by costs associated with expanding our northern california operations and lower than anticipated revenue levels from our recent acquisition of real estate appraisal services  inc the following table sets forth unaudited quarterly operating data for the most recent five quarters 
such data has been prepared substantially on the same basis as the audited financial statements appearing in our form k  and includes all adjustments  consisting of only normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of the data 
however  our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future 
future fluctuations may be a result of a variety of factors  including interest rates and general real estate economic conditions  seasonality  the timing of acquisitions  and our ability to control costs in response to declining order volume 
accordingly  we believe that period to period comparisons of our historical results may be neither meaningful nor predictive of our future performance 
the quarterly data should be read together with the financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in our form k 
three months ended december  march  june  september  december  in thousands  except per share data total revenue net income earnings attributable to common shares earnings per common share the following table sets forth our contractual commitments and commercial obligations as of december  in thousands contractual commitments and commercial obligations payments due by period contractual obligations less than one year thereafter debt maturities minimum lease commitments total item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our business is cyclical due to the effect of interest rate fluctuations on the level of real estate activity 
periods of high interest rates adversely effect real estate activity and therefore title and escrow revenues 
in addition  the amount of interest income derived from available cash is subject to interest rate fluctuations 
our investment portfolio and borrowings are subject to interest rate risk 
an increase or decrease in prevailing interest rates typically translate into a decrease or increase in fair values of interest sensitive financial instruments 
at december   the carrying amounts reported in our consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  fixed maturity bonds and equity securities  accounts receivable  accounts payable and debt approximate fair value 
fair values of fixed maturity bonds may be affected by the credit worthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the security and other general market conditions 
our investments in equity securities are based on quoted market prices by third party sources 
market prices are subject to variability and as a result  the amount we may realize from a sale of an equity security investment may ultimately be significantly different than the reported market values at december  variability in market prices may occur as a result of changes in economic conditions  relative price of similar  alternative investment choices and the market s perceived change in the value of the security itself 
our long term debt is comprised of three term loans  the smallest of which provides for a variable interest rate 
our other indebtedness consists of capitalized leases 
had interest rates increased basis points  interest expense on the variable portion of indebtedness would have increased  for the year ended december  however  because the variable debt had a provision for an interest rate floor at  had interest rates decreased basis points  there would have been no impact to interest expense for the year ended december  had interest rates increased or decreased basis points  interest expense on outstanding debt would have increased or decreased approximately  for the year ended recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 exchanges of non monetary assets an amendment of opinion no 
this statement amends apb opinion no 
to eliminate the exception for non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges on non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a non monetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the provisions of statement no 
will be effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we have evaluated this accounting standard and have determined it will not have an impact to our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb revised sfas no 
 share based payment sfas r 
sfas r replaces sfas no 
and  although the two pronouncements are similar in most respects  a key difference among the pronouncements is that sfas r generally requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services rendered in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
sfas r is effective as of the beginning of the first interim reporting period that begins after june  and may be adopted earlier 
the company did not adopt sfas r as of december  and as a result  sfas r has not affected the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations to date 
the adoption of sfas r is expected to result in an increase in the company s employee costs although the actual impact has not yet been determined as the company has not yet determined which option valuation approach it will use to estimate the fair value of the stock option grants 
the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issues no 
 accounting for pre existing relationships between the parties to a business combination for reporting periods beginning after october  this task force consensus discusses that consummation of a business combination between two parties that have a pre existing relationship should be evaluated to determine whether a settlement of a pre existing relationship exists 
we have evaluated this eitf consensus and have determined it will not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements
