throughout our history we have established an extensive network of investment referral relationships 
investment proposals may  however  come to the corporation from many other sources  and may include unsolicited proposals from the public and referrals from banks  lawyers  accountants and other members of the financial community 
the corporation believes that its reputation in the community and experience provide a competitive advantage in originating new investments 
in a typical private financing  the management team of the corporation will review  analyze  and confirm  through due diligence  the business plan and operations of the potential portfolio company 
the corporation will also familiarize themselves with the portfolio company s industry and competitive landscape and may conduct additional reference checks with customers and suppliers of the portfolio company 
following an initial investment in a portfolio company  the corporation may be requested to make follow on investments in the company 
follow on investments may be made to take advantage of warrants or other preferential rights granted to the corporation or otherwise to increase or maintain the corporation s position in a promising portfolio company 
the corporation may also be called upon to provide an additional investment to a portfolio company in order for that company to fully implement its business plans  to develop a new line of business or to recover from unexpected business problems 
follow on investments in a portfolio company are evaluated on a case by case basis 
the corporation will exit private finance investments generally through the maturation of the debt security or when a liquidity event takes place  such as the sale  recapitalization  or initial public offering of a portfolio company 
the method and timing of the disposition of the corporation s portfolio investments can be critical to the realization of maximum total return 
the corporation generally expects to dispose of its equity securities through the private sales of securities to other investors or through an outright sale of the company or a merger 
the corporation anticipates its debentures will be repaid with interest and hopes to realize further appreciation from the warrants or other equity type instruments it receives in connection with the origination of the debenture 
the corporation anticipates generating cash for new investments and operating expenses through sba leverage draw downs and interest and principal payments from its portfolio concerns 
critical accounting policies the corporation prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies  including critical accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item the increasing complexity of the business environment and applicable authoritative accounting guidance require us to closely monitor our accounting policies 
the corporation has identified three critical accounting policies that require significant judgment 
the following summary 
table of contents of our critical accounting policies is intended to enhance your ability to assess our financial condition and results of operations and the potential volatility due to changes in estimates 
valuation of investments the most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of the corporation s consolidated financial statements is the valuation of its investments and the related unrealized appreciation or depreciation 
the corporation has adopted the sba s valuation guidelines for sbic s  which describe the policies and procedures used in valuing investments 
investments are valued in accordance with the corporation s established valuation policy and are stated at fair value as determined in good faith by the management of the corporation and submitted to the board of directors for approval 
there is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith 
as a result  determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for our investments 
the board of directors considers fair value to be the amount which the corporation may reasonably expect to receive for portfolio securities when sold on the valuation date 
the corporation analyzes and values each individual investment on a quarterly basis  and records unrealized depreciation for an investment that it believes has become impaired  including where collection of a loan or realization of an equity security is doubtful 
conversely  the corporation will record unrealized appreciation if we believe that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and  therefore  our equity security has also appreciated in value 
without a readily ascertainable market value and because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation  the fair value of our investments is determined in good faith by the board of directors 
these estimated fair values may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed 
in the valuation process  the corporation uses financial information received monthly  quarterly  and annually from its portfolio companies  which includes both audited and unaudited financial statements  annual projections and budgets prepared by the portfolio company and other financial information supplied by the portfolio companies management 
this information is used to determine financial condition  performance  and valuation of the portfolio investments 
valuation should be reduced if a company s performance and potential have significantly deteriorated 
if the factors which led to the reduction in valuation are overcome  the valuation may be restored 
another key factor used in valuing equity investments is recent arms length equity transactions entered into by the portfolio company that the corporation utilizes to form a basis for its underlying value 
many times the terms of these equity transactions may not be identical to those of the corporation  and the impact on these variations as it relates to market value may be impossible to quantify 
any changes in estimated fair value are recorded in our statement of operations as net increase decrease in unrealized depreciation appreciation 
revenue recognition interest income interest income generally is recognized on the accrual basis except where the investment is in default or otherwise presumed to be in doubt 
in such cases  interest is recognized at the time of receipt 
a reserve for possible losses on interest receivable is maintained when appropriate 
certain investments of the corporation are structured to provide a deferred interest period where interest is not currently due 
the rand sbic interest accrual is regulated by the sba s accounting standards and financial reporting requirements for small business investment companies 
under these rules 
table of contents interest income cannot be recognized if collection is doubtful  and a reserve must be established 
the collection of interest is presumed to be in doubt when there is substantial doubt about a portfolio company s ability to continue as a going concern or the loan is in default more than days 
management also utilizes other qualitative and quantitative measures to determine the value of a portfolio investment and the collectability of any accrued interest 
deferred tax assets the deferred tax assets are primarily related to future tax benefits associated with the utilization of the corporation s net operating loss carryforwards nol s 
the realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent on the corporation generating sufficient taxable income through operations and realization of gains on its investments to utilize these nol s 
management has determined that a valuation allowance is not required based upon future estimated income and historical significant gains realized on the liquidation of its portfolio investments 
in the event that management s estimates or expectations regarding its future profitability do not come to fruition  the corporation may be required to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
financial condition overview increase decrease total assets total liabilities net assets the corporation s financial condition is dependent on the success of its portfolio holdings 
it has invested a substantial portion of its assets in small and medium sized companies 
the following summarizes the corporation s investment portfolio at the year ends indicated

the cash and cash equivalents approximated of net assets at december  compared to at december  the effect of the increase in tax net operating loss carry forwards and the change in unrealized depreciation on investments resulted in a net increase in the net deferred tax asset from  at december  to a net deferred tax asset of  at december  results of operations investment income the corporation s investment objective is to achieve long term capital appreciation on its equity investments while maintaining a current cash flow from its debenture instruments 
therefore  the corporation will invest in a mixture of debenture and equity instruments which will provide a current return on a portion of the portfolio 
the equity features contained in our investment portfolio are structured to realize capital appreciation over the long term and may not necessarily generate current income in the form of dividends or interest 
in addition  the corporation earns interest income from investing its idle funds in money market instruments
