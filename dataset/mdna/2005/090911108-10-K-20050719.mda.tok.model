item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report and other information incorporated by reference in this report  if any 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in any forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
restatement of financial statements the following discussion and analysis gives effect to the restatement discussed in the explanatory note to this annual report on form k and in note to our consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  some of the data set forth in this section is not comparable to discussions and data in our previously filed annual reports for the corresponding period 
overview we are the world s leading dental laser company 
we design  manufacture and market proprietary dental laser systems that allow dentists  periodontists  endodontists  oral surgeons and other specialists to perform a broad range of dental procedures  including cosmetic and complex surgical applications 
our systems are designed to provide clinically superior performance for many types of dental procedures  with less pain and faster recovery times than are generally achieved with drills  scalpels and other dental instruments 
we have clearance from the us food and drug administration  or fda  to market our laser systems in the united states and also have the necessary approvals to sell our laser systems in canada  the european union and other international markets 
we are currently pursuing regulatory approval to market and sell our waterlase system in japan 
since  we have sold more than  waterlase systems and approximately  laser systems in over countries 
we offer two categories of laser system products i waterlase system and ii diode system 
our flagship product category  the waterlase system  uses a patented combination of water and laser to perform most procedures currently performed using dental drills  scalpels and other traditional dental instruments for cutting soft and hard tissue 
we also offer a family of diode laser system products to perform soft tissue and cosmetic procedures  including tooth whitening 
waterlase system 
we refer to our patented interaction of water with laser as ysgg laser hydrophotonics 
ysgg is a shortened abbreviation referring to the unique crystal er  cr ysgg laser used in the waterlase  which contains the elements erbium  chromium  yttrium  scandium  gallium and garnet 
this unique crystal laser produces energy with specific absorption and tissue interaction characteristics optimized for dental applications 
hydrophotonics refers to the interaction of laser with water to produce energy to cut tissue 
through ysgg laser hydrophotonics  the waterlase system can precisely cut hard tissue  such as bone and teeth  and soft tissue  such as gums  with minimal or no damage to surrounding tissue 
the waterlase system is the best selling dental laser system  and we estimate it currently accounts for a majority of all dental lasers sold worldwide 
diode system 
we also offer a family of diode system products  which use a semiconductor diode laser to perform soft tissue and cosmetic procedures  including tooth whitening 
our diode system serves the growing markets for cosmetic and hygiene procedures 
the diode system  together with our waterlase system  offer practitioners a broad product line with a range of features and price points 
we also manufacture and sell accessories and consumables for our laser systems  such as hand pieces  laser tips and tooth whitening gel 
the waterlase system comprised  and of our total revenue for the years ended december   and respectively 
the diode system comprised  and of our total revenue for the same periods 

table of contents principal factors considered by our management among other things  in managing our business  our management is particularly focused on the following factors and considerations the need to ensure that our products are designed to meet existing and anticipated customer needs the need to continuously extend our reach of technology the need to leverage our intellectual property to expand our end market applications critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for each period 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe are i the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and ii that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition 
we sell products domestically to customers through our direct sales force  and internationally through a direct sales force and through distributors 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and title and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to our customer or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
through august  the terms of our purchase orders for products sold domestically required payment in full before title was transferred 
accordingly  with all other criteria being met  we recognized revenue when payment was received 
for products sold internationally through our direct sales force we recognized revenue when all other criteria was met and we completed installation  which was when the customer became obligated to pay 
in august  we modified the sales arrangements with our customers so that title transfers to the customer upon shipment for domestic sales  and there is an enforceable obligation to pay upon shipment for international direct sales 
beginning in august  we have been recording revenue for domestic sales and international direct sales upon shipment 
as a result  during we recorded million in revenue before the modification to our sales arrangements and million restated in revenue after the modification to our sales arrangements 
we recognize revenue for products sold through our distributors internationally when the product is delivered 
revenue unaffected by the changes in our customer agreements with distributors was million for the year ended december  we adopted eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  on july   which requires us to evaluate whether the separate deliverables in our arrangements can be unbundled 
we determined that the sales of our waterlase system include separate deliverables consisting of the product  disposables used with the waterlase  installation and training 
for these sales  we apply the residual value method  which requires us to allocate the total arrangement consideration less the fair value of the undelivered elements to the delivered elements 
we determined that the sales of our diode system include separate deliverables consisting of the product  disposables and training 
for these sales  we apply the relative fair value method  which requires us to allocate the total arrangement consideration to the relative fair value of each element 
deferred revenue attributable to the undelivered elements  primarily training  installation and 
table of contents disposables  are included in deferred revenue when the product is shipped and are recognized when the related items are delivered or the service is performed 
the key judgment related to our revenue recognition relates to the collectibility of payment from the customer 
we evaluate the customer s credit worthiness prior to the shipment of the product 
based on our assessment of the credit information available to us  we may determine the credit risk is higher than normally acceptable  and we will either decline the purchase or defer the revenue until payment is reasonably assured 
although all sales are final  we accept returns of products in certain  limited circumstances and record a provision for sales returns based on historical experience concurrent with the recognition of revenue 
the sales returns allowance is recorded as a reduction of accounts receivable  revenue and cost of revenue 
we recognize revenue for royalties under licensing agreements for our patented technology when the product using our technology is sold 
we estimate and recognize the amount earned based on historical performance and current knowledge about the business operations of our licensees 
our estimates have been historically consistent with amounts reported by the licensees 
valuation of accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable to estimate the risk of extending credit to customers 
we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our knowledge of customers and their compliance with credit terms 
the evaluation process includes a review of customers accounts on a regular basis which incorporates input from sales  service and finance personnel 
the review process evaluates all account balances with amounts outstanding days and other specific amounts for which information obtained indicates that the balance may be uncollectible 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is adjusted based on such evaluation  with a corresponding provision included in general and administrative expenses 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when we feel it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
valuation of inventory 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost determined using the first in  first out method or market 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of inventory and maintain an allowance for excess and obsolete inventory to adjust the carrying value as necessary to the lower of cost or market 
we evaluate quantities on hand  physical condition and technical functionality  as these characteristics may be impacted by anticipated customer demand for current products and new product introductions 
unfavorable changes in estimates of excess and obsolete inventory would result in an increase in cost of revenue and a decrease in gross profit 
valuation of long lived assets 
property  plant and equipment  and certain intangibles with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenue or otherwise productively support our business goals 
we monitor events and changes in circumstances  which could indicate that the carrying balances of long lived assets may exceed the undiscounted expected future cash flows from those assets 
if such a condition were to exist  we will recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we conducted our annual impairment analysis of our goodwill and trade names as of june  and concluded there had not been an impairment 
during the fourth quarter of  we changed our strategy to focus our sales efforts on high end laser products such as the new waterlase md product  which was first sold during the fourth quarter of this conclusion was due to the increased competition for relatively low priced laser devices 
as a result  the actual sales of diolase plus were below our original expectations and we expect this trend to continue 
we estimated the fair value of the diolase plus trade name based on a relief from royalty approach using discounted cash flows from revised projected diolase plus revenue 
the  excess of the carrying value over the asset s estimated fair value has been recorded as a charge to operations in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents warranty cost 
products sold directly to end users are covered by a warranty against defects in material and workmanship for a period of one year 
products sold internationally to distributors are covered by a warranty on parts for up to fourteen months 
estimated warranty expenses are recorded as an accrued liability  with a corresponding provision to cost of revenue 
this estimate is recognized concurrent with the recognition of revenue 
the accrual is based on our historical experience and our expectation of future conditions 
an increase in warranty claims or in the costs associated with servicing those claims would result in an increase in the accrual and a decrease in gross profit 
litigation and other contingencies 
we regularly evaluate our exposure to threatened or pending litigation and other business contingencies 
because of the uncertainties related to the amount of loss from litigation and other business contingencies  the recording of losses relating to such exposures requires significant judgment about the potential range of outcomes 
as additional information about current or future litigation or other contingencies becomes available  we will assess whether such information warrants the recording of expense relating to contingencies 
to be recorded as expense  a loss contingency must be both probable and reasonably estimable 
if a loss contingency is material but is not both probable and estimable  we will disclose the matter in the notes to the financial statements 
during the year ended december   we recorded a million charge to operations for a patent infringement legal settlement related to the lawsuit between us and diodem llc 
income taxes 
we estimate our actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as the timing for recognizing revenue and expenses  for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we are required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets  which include net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences that are expected to be deductible in future years  will be recoverable from future taxable income or tax planning strategies 
if we conclude that our deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized a probability level of more than  a valuation allowance is not recorded 
during the year ended december   we determined that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets  which consist primarily of net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards  would not be realized 
in this determination  we considered factors such as our earnings history  future projections and tax planning strategies 
if sufficient evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions becomes apparent  we may reduce our valuation allowance  resulting in income tax benefits in our statement of operations and in additional paid in capital 
management evaluates the potential realization of our deferred tax assets and assesses the need for releasing the valuation allowance periodically 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain data from our consolidated income statements for the years ended december   and  expressed as a percentage of revenue years ended december  restated consolidated statements of operations data net revenue cost of revenue gross profit other income operating expenses sales and marketing general and administrative engineering and development patent infringement legal settlement impairment of intangible asset total operating expenses loss income from operations non operating income loss income before income taxes income tax provision benefit net loss income net revenue 
revenue consists of sales of our laser systems  related disposables and accessories  service revenue  training revenue and royalty revenue 
we have at various times experienced fluctuations in revenue due to seasonality 
in our experience  revenue in the first quarter typically is lower than average  and revenue in the fourth quarter typically is higher than average  due to the buying patterns of dental professionals 
the fourth quarter of accounted for of our revenue for the year  whereas the first quarter of accounted for of revenue for the year 
the third quarter accounted for of our revenue in  whereas the second quarter accounted for of our revenue in during  our third quarter was significantly impacted by two items 
we believe that many customers delayed purchasing decisions pending the anticipated launching of our new waterlase product  the waterlase md 
in addition  some of our us trade shows and seminars were impacted in the southeast by the region s major hurricanes 
trade shows and seminars are a significant sales generating process for us 
our historical seasonality pattern is a recurring trend that we expect to continue 
since many of our costs are fixed in the short term  if we have a shortfall in revenue resulting from a change in our historical seasonality pattern  or otherwise  we may be unable to reduce expenses quickly enough to avoid losses 
many dentists finance their purchases through third party leasing companies or banks 
in these transactions  the dentist first enters into a purchase order with us 
we then enter into a purchase order with the leasing company  which purchases the product from us  and the dentist enters into a lease agreement with the leasing company 
we receive payment in full for the product by the leasing company  and we are not a party to the lease with the dentist 
the dentist pays the leasing company or bank in installments  and we do not bear the credit risk that the dentist might not make payments 
the leasing companies and banks do not have recourse to us for a dentist s failure to make payments  nor do we have any obligation to take back the product at the end of the lease 
approximately of our revenue in  of our revenue in  and of our revenue in were generated from dentists who financed their purchase through national technology leasing corporation  an 
table of contents equipment leasing broker 
we are regularly approached by leasing companies seeking to finance purchases of our products and do not believe the loss of national technology leasing or any other current financing source would materially harm our business 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue is comprised of all costs to manufacture our products  including materials  labor and related overhead costs such as depreciation  warranty and service costs 
other income  net 
other income consists of gain loss on sale of assets 
the gain on sale of assets primarily related to the sale and leaseback of our manufacturing facility in san clemente  california in march this sale resulted in a gain of  and is being recognized over the remaining term of the lease  which expires in other income in and included the amortization of deferred gain offset by a gain loss on the sale of certain fixed assets 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries and benefits  commissions  and other costs related to our direct sales force  advertising costs and expenses related to trade shows and seminars 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and benefits of administrative personnel as well as insurance  professional and regulatory fees  provisions for doubtful accounts  penalties and interest on amounts collected from customers but not timely remitted to the states  and subsequent gain for the amount of the liability relieved by the state 
engineering and development 
engineering and development expenses consist of engineering personnel salaries and benefits  prototype supplies  contract services and consulting fees related to product development 
patent infringement legal settlement 
in january  we acquired the intellectual property portfolio of diodem llc diodem  consisting of certain us and international patents of which four were asserted against us  and settled the existing litigation between us and diodem  for consideration of million in cash   shares of common stock  and a five year warrant exercisable into  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
in addition  if certain criteria specified in the purchase agreement are satisfied on or before july   additional shares we have placed in escrow may be released to diodem and we will incur an expense equal to the fair market value of those shares at the time of their release 
these escrowed shares had a fair market value of  at the time of the binding letter of intent 
the total consideration was estimated to have a value of million  excluding the value of the shares held in escrow 
as of december   we accrued million for the settlement of the existing litigation 
in january  we recorded an intangible asset of  representing the estimated fair value of the intellectual property acquired 
as a result of the acquisition  diodem immediately withdrew its patent infringement claims against us and the case was formally dismissed on may  we did not pay and have no obligation to pay any royalties to diodem on past or future sales of our products 
impairment of intangible asset 
during  we determined that our intangible assets associated with trade names were impaired based on circumstances that arose in the fourth quarter surrounding future expected sales of our diolase product 
the underlying factors contributing to our revised estimate included a reduced projected rate of sales growth for this product as a result of increased competition for relatively low priced laser devices resulting in management s decision to focus our sales efforts on high end laser products such as the new waterlase md product launched in the fourth quarter of an expense of  was recorded related to this impairment 
non operating income loss 
non operating income loss consists of interest income and expense  foreign currency gains and losses and items not directly related to our operations 
interest income relates to interest earned on our cash balances and short term investments  and interest expense relates to interest costs on our line of credit 
we generate a substantial portion of our revenue from the sale of products outside the united states 
our sales in europe are denominated principally in euros  and our sales in other international markets are denominated in dollars 
as we do not engage in hedging transactions to offset foreign currency fluctuations  we 
table of contents are at risk for changes in the value of the dollar relative to the value of the euro 
an increase in the relative value of the dollar would lead to less income from sales denominated in euros unless we increase prices  which may not be possible due to competitive conditions in europe 
conversely  a decrease in the relative value of the dollar would lead to more income from sales denominated in euros 
additionally  we are obligated to pay expenses relating to our german facility in euros 
thus  we are also at risk for changes in the value of the dollar relative to the euro with respect to our obligation to pay expenses relating to our operations in germany 
an increase in the value of the dollar relative to the euro would reduce the expenses associated with the operations of our german facility  whereas a decrease in the relative value of the dollar would increase the cost associated with the operations of our german facility 
income taxes 
we estimate our actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as the timing for recognizing revenue and expenses  for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we are required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets  which include net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences that are expected to be deductible in future years  will be recoverable from future taxable income or tax planning strategies 
if we conclude that our deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized a probability level of more than  a valuation allowance is not recorded 
based upon our operating losses during and the available evidence  management determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets as of december  will not be realized 
consequently  we recorded a valuation allowance for our net deferred tax asset in the amount of million as of december  in this determination  we considered factors such as our earnings history  future projected earnings and tax planning strategies 
if sufficient evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income becomes apparent  we may reduce our valuation allowance  resulting in income tax benefits in our statement of operations and in additional paid in capital 
management evaluates the potential realization of our deferred tax assets and assesses the need for reducing the valuation allowance periodically 
during the year ended december   we determined that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets  which consist primarily of nol carryforwards  would be realized  resulting in an million net deferred tax benefit 
this deferred tax benefit does not include million for stock option deduction benefits recorded as a credit to additional paid in capital 
we considered factors such as our profitable operating history  three years of cumulative income and projections of continued profitability at that time in making this determination 
the utilization of nol and credit carryforwards may be limited under the provisions of internal revenue code section and similar state provisions 
section of the internal revenue code of generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of nol carryforwards that may be used to offset taxable income where a corporation has undergone significant changes in its stock ownership 
in october  we completed an analysis to determine the potential applicability of any annual limitations imposed by section based on our analysis  we believe that  as of december   we have  for federal income tax purposes  approximately million of nol carryforwards 
of this amount  approximately million is available to offset federal taxable income and the taxable income generated in future years 
additional nol carryforwards will become available at the rate of approximately million per year for the years through however  any future ownership changes qualifying under section may limit our ability to use remaining nol carryforwards 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  restated net revenue 
revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  as compared with revenue of million for the year ended december  the increase of million consists of increases in the number of products and services sold as a result of a greater 
table of contents marketing and sales focus 
however  the rate of increase in revenue growth year over year represents a decrease from the recent historical trend 
this decrease in the historical rate of growth was first observed in the second quarter of and has continued through the fourth quarter of while we have identified during the year a number of factors that could have influenced the change in the rate of growth  at this point in time we believe that the change is not an aberration but rather a shift in our growth rate 
we believe this shift involves the makeup of our end customer  whereby we are in a transition from selling to innovators to a larger more sustainable early adapter market segment 
this market segment is typically associated with a longer selling cycle 
the size of the potential market  our position within that market and the quality and reliability of our product offerings are fundamentally unchanged  however  the change in the rate of growth has caused us to examine our sales and marketing strategies 
although we do not expect our revenue growth to reach previous historical rates that were in excess of  we do expect modest revenue growth in the results for were favorably impacted due to a change in the timing of revenue recognition 
in august  we modified our sales arrangements with our customers and began recognizing revenue upon shipment for our domestic sales  or on an accrual basis  which had previously been recognized upon receipt of payment in full  or on a cash basis 
additionally  we began to recognize revenue upon shipment for our international direct sales  which had previously been recognized after completion of installation 
as a result  during we recorded million in revenue under the revenue recognition policy in effect before the modification to our sales arrangements and million in revenue under our revenue recognition policy in effect after the modification to our sales arrangements 
net revenues unaffected by the changes in our revenue recognition policy were million for the year ended december  our waterlase system comprised and of our total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our diolase system comprised and of our revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we expect the waterlase system will continue to account for the majority of our sales 
many dentists finance their purchases through third party leasing companies 
approximately of our revenue for the year ended december  and of our revenue for the year ended december  were generated from dentists who financed their purchases through national technology leasing corporation  an independent equipment leasing company 
the recent history of low interest rates over the past several years may have benefited purchasers of our products by reducing the interest expense to finance the purchase or lease of our products  although we do not believe it is possible to measure the effect of lower interest rates on our sales 
international revenue for the year ended december  was million  or of revenue  as compared with million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  sales to asia  latin america  pacific rim countries and australia were approximately million while sales to europe  middle east and africa emea were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  we expected our international revenue to remain at approximately of our total revenue for gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million  or of revenue  an increase of million  as compared with gross profit of million  or of revenue for the year ended december  gross profit for the year ended december  included million of gross profit for domestic sales recognized on a cash basis and million recognized on an accrual basis 
gross profit for the year ended december  included million recognized for international direct sales upon completion of installation and million recognized upon shipment 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was due to an increase in manufacturing costs related to the launch of the new waterlase md product in the fourth quarter of as well to an increase in fixed manufacturing infrastructure  including quality control  materials management and other support activities 
we are generating a lower gross margin on the initial production quantities of the waterlase md due to these factors 
we expect that increased manufacturing costs associated with the new waterlase md will continue until our factory has achieved a proper balance between all 
table of contents products and throughput efficiency is maximized 
we also experienced an increase in excess and obsolete inventory of  associated with slow moving raw materials  which decreased our gross margin approximately 
additionally  included in cost of revenue is million and of expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively  for training and wcli seminars related to our multiple element arrangements  which decreased our gross margin by approximately 
once maximization of efficiency is achieved  we expect that our gross margins will stabilize in the low to mid range 
other income  net 
other income consists of gain on sale of assets 
the gain on sale of assets for the years ended december  and of  each year related to the sale and leaseback of our manufacturing facility in san clemente  california in march this sale resulted in a gain of  and is being recognized over the remaining term of the lease  which expires in other income in included the amortization of deferred gain of  offset by a loss of  on the sale of certain fixed assets 
other income in included the amortization of deferred gain of  plus a gain of  on the sale of certain fixed assets 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of revenue  a million increase as compared with million  or of revenue for the year ended december  the increases in operating expenses were  for the most part  related to planned marketing expenses geared to an expected higher level of sales and general and administrative expenses driven mainly by high levels of legal and compliance costs as described below 
other increases in operating expenses represent increases in fixed organizational infrastructure costs necessary to support our growth 
we expect to be able to leverage the fixed nature of these costs as our revenue increases 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of revenue  as compared with million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  approximately million of the increase was due to personnel related costs  including commission expense on higher sales  increase in our sales force and related travel and support costs 
marketing expense  including advertising  direct mailing fees  trade shows and seminars increased approximately million  of which approximately half related to the launch of our new waterlase md product 
we expect our sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase  in large part due to increases in expenses associated with education and training of potential customers which is an essential component of our effort to increase market acceptance of laser technology and our products 
we expect sales and marketing expense to remain relatively consistent as a percentage of revenue in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of revenue  as compared with million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  legal fees  related principally to the diodem litigation  totaled million  an increase of million from the prior year 
costs related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act  including professional expenses as well as temporary labor  were approximately million  the majority of which were expended in the last six months of other personnel and related costs increased approximately  representing increased infrastructure in finance  information technology  human resources and administration both in response to our growth as well as to meet the ongoing compliance standards related to the sarbanes oxley act 
we expect professional fee expense to continue in response to maintenance and improvements of internal controls under the sarbanes oxley act  albeit at a lesser amount than additionally  our general and administrative expense for the year ended december   included amounts accrued for sales tax liability and related penalties and interest totaling  compared to  for the same period of in  we also recognized a gain of  for the abatement of certain penalties and interest related to the sales tax compared to  for the same period of costs associated with general liability insurance  employee group insurance and workers compensation insurance increased by approximately  in as compared to we expect these insurance costs to continue to increase significantly as a function of our growth and insurance market conditions in general 
we recorded a reserve for uncollectible accounts totaling  in  an increase of  compared to bank charges relating to credit card sales increased by 
table of contents  as compared to and will likely continue to grow commensurate with our sales growth 
overall  general and administrative costs are expected to decrease as a percentage of revenue primarily through reduced legal related expenses as a result of the conclusion of our patent litigation with diodem 
engineering and development 
engineering and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of revenue  as compared with million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  approximately half of the increase in absolute dollars is due to materials and consulting fees related to the development of the waterlase md product  with the balance resulting from an increase in the level of research projects and patent development 
we expect engineering and development expenses to increase during as we develop new applications for our technology and expand on the usage of recently acquired patents 
patent infringement legal settlement 
in january  we acquired the intellectual property portfolio of diodem llc diodem  consisting of certain us and international patents of which four were asserted against us  and settled the existing litigation between us and diodem  for consideration of million in cash   shares of common stock  and a five year warrant exercisable into  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
in addition  if certain criteria specified in the purchase agreement are satisfied on or before july   additional shares we have placed in escrow may be released to diodem and we will incur an expense equal to the fair market value of those shares at the time of their release 
these escrowed shares had a fair market value of  at the time of the binding letter of intent 
the total consideration was estimated to have a value of million  excluding the value of the shares held in escrow 
as of december   we accrued million for the settlement of the existing litigation 
in january  we recorded an intangible asset of  representing the estimated fair value of the intellectual property acquired 
as a result of the acquisition  diodem immediately withdrew its patent infringement claims against us and the case was formally dismissed on may  we did not pay and have no obligation to pay any royalties to diodem on past or future sales of our products 
impairment of intangible asset 
during  we determined that our intangible assets associated with certain trade names were impaired based on circumstances that arose in the fourth quarter surrounding future expected sales of our diolase product 
the underlying factors contributing to our revised estimate included a reduced projected rate of sales growth for this product as a result of increased competition for relatively low priced laser devices resulting in management s decision to focus our sales efforts on high end laser products such as the new waterlase md product launched in the fourth quarter of an expense of  was recorded related to this impairment 
non operating income loss gain on foreign currency transactions 
we realized an  gain on foreign currency transactions for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  due to the changes in exchange rates between the united states dollar and euro 
due to the relatively low volume of transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  we have not engaged in hedging transactions to offset foreign currency fluctuations 
therefore  we are at risk for changes in the value of the dollar relative to the value of the euro  which is the only non us dollar denominated currency in which we have transacted business 
gain on sale of marketable securities 
our investments are comprised of us government securities and have been classified as available for sale 
we realized a  gain on sale of marketable securities for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  as a result of the million in net proceeds received from our public offering in the first quarter of  we engaged in investment transactions throughout interest income 
interest income relates to interest earned on our cash and investment balances 
interest income for the year ended december  was  as compared with  for the year ended december  due to an increase in our investment balances resulting from our public offering in the first quarter of 
table of contents interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december  interest expense in consisted of interest on our outstanding balance on our line of credit  standby fees relating to our increased borrowing capacity under the line of credit  and the periodic use of the line during the year 
income taxes 
an income tax provision of million was recognized for the year ended december  a significant component of this income tax provision was the recording of the million valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
for the year ended december   we recognized an income tax benefit of million and a credit of million to additional paid in capital 
the income tax benefit for the year ended december  was due to the reduction of the valuation allowance in the amount of million 
the credit to additional paid in capital was the result of a stock option deduction available to us in and prior year deductions included in the deferred tax assets which were previously offset by the valuation allowance 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon our operating losses and the weight of the available evidence  management believes it is more likely than not that we will not realize all of these deductible differences 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which will begin expiring in as of december   we had research and development credit carryforwards for federal and state purposes of approximately  and  respectively  which will begin expiring in for federal purposes and carryforward indefinitely for state purposes 
the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited under the provisions of internal revenue code section and similar state provisions 
year ended december  restated compared with year ended december  restated net revenue 
revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  as compared with revenue of million for the year ended december  approximately million of the increase resulted from a increase in sales of products and services and the balance was due to a change in the timing of revenue recognition described below 
in august  we modified our sales arrangements with our customers and began recognizing revenue upon shipment for our domestic sales  or on an accrual basis  which had previously been recognized upon receipt of payment in full  or on a cash basis 
additionally  we began to recognize revenue upon shipment for our international direct sales  which had previously been recognized after completion of installation 
as a result of the change in our revenue recognition policy during the third quarter of  our revenue is not directly comparable to the year ended december  during the year ended december  domestic sales were recognized on a cash basis and international direct sales were recognized after completion of installation 
revenue during the year ended december  included million of revenue for domestic sales recognized on a cash basis and million recognized on an accrual basis 
revenue during the year ended december  included million recognized for international direct sales upon completion of installation and million recognized upon shipment 
as of december  our balance sheet reflects approximately  that has been deferred on product shipments for which payment has not been received in full for domestic sales and where installation has not been completed for international direct sales 
we cannot provide any assurance as to the timing or whether the deferred revenue will ultimately be collected  or when or whether installations will be completed 
other than the possible recognition of this deferred revenue balance  the positive impact to revenue for the year ended december  that resulted from the change in our revenue recognition policy will not occur in future periods 
the waterlase and lasersmile systems accounted for approximately and of our revenue for the year ended december   respectively 

table of contents many dentists finance their purchases through third party leasing companies 
approximately of our revenue for the year ended december  and of our revenue for the year ended december  were generated from dentists who financed their purchases through national technology leasing corporation  an independent equipment leasing company 
the decline in interest rates between and may have benefited purchasers of our products by reducing the interest expense to finance the purchase or lease of our products  although we do not believe it is possible to measure the effect of lower interest rates on our sales 
international revenue for the year ended december  was million  or of revenue  as compared with million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  revenue to asia and europe was million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  compared to million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  we had expected international revenue to grow as a percentage of total revenue in and in the future 
although international revenue grew year over year  in line with our overall expectations for total revenue  domestic revenue growth was stronger due to higher than expected demand in the united states 
during  we invested more resources in international sales and marketing and related infrastructure 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million  or of revenue  an increase of million  as compared with gross profit of million  or of revenue for the year ended december  gross profit for the year ended december  included million of gross profit for domestic revenue recognized on a cash basis and million recognized on an accrual basis 
gross profit for the year ended december  included million recognized for international direct revenue upon completion of installation and million recognized upon shipment 
the increase in gross profit is attributable to leveraging the increase in revenue against fixed and partially fixed manufacturing costs  reflecting better absorption of fixed manufacturing costs 
the increase is also due to the relative increase in domestic revenue as a percentage of total revenue  which generated higher gross margins 
the gross margin associated with revenue to international distributors is generally lower as the selling price is lower in order to compensate dealers for the marketing and sales costs they must incur 
international revenue increased as a percentage of total revenue from to but then decreased as a percentage in therefore  while gross margin may continue to increase due to manufacturing efficiencies  relative increases in international revenue compared to domestic revenue may offset the effect of manufacturing efficiencies on gross profit 
revenue of the diolase and pulsemaster systems did not have a significant impact on gross profit 
other income  net 
other income consists of gain on sale of assets 
the gain on sale of assets for the years ended december  and of  each year related to the sale and leaseback of our manufacturing facility in san clemente  california in march this sale resulted in a gain of  and is being recognized over the remaining term of the lease  which expires in other income in included the amortization of deferred gain of  plus a gain of  on the sale of certain other assets 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of revenue as compared with million  or of revenue for the year ended december  approximately of the increase  or million  consists of sales and marketing costs incurred to generate the increase in revenue 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of revenue  as compared with million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  approximately of the increase in absolute dollars was due to the increase in our direct sales force  development of our infrastructure for international sales  and higher commission expense related to the increase in sales  including recognition  of approximately  in deferred commission expense related to revenue recognized that had been deferred 
marketing expense increased million due to increased staff and additional direct marketing activities in europe 
expenses related to trade shows  seminars and the world clinical laser institute increased approximately million due to an expansion in the scope of activities related to those programs 
we expect our sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase  in large part due 
table of contents to increases in expenses associated with education and training of potential customers  which is an essential component of our effort to increase market acceptance of laser technology and our products 
overall  sales and marketing expense is expected to decrease slightly as a percentage of revenue  assuming sales continue to grow in line with our expectations 
incremental costs relating to the marketing and sale of the american dental laser products have not had and are not expected to have a significant impact on total sales and marketing expense 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of revenue  as compared with million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  professional expenses accounted for approximately of the dollar increase  including approximately  in expenses related to the restatement of our consolidated financial statements  fees related to legal proceedings and fees incurred on various consulting projects 
we expect professional fee expense to continue to increase as a cost of compliance with new regulatory requirements  such as those generated from the sarbanes oxley act 
costs associated with general liability coverage  employee group insurance and workers compensation insurance increased by  in as compared to we expect these insurance costs to continue to increase significantly as a function of our growth and insurance market conditions in general 
bank charges relating to credit card sales increased by  as compared to and will likely continue to grow commensurate with our sales growth 
no significant additional general and administrative expenses have been incurred or are expected from the acquisition and production of the american dental laser products except for amortization expense related to certain intangible assets acquired 
engineering and development 
engineering and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of revenue  as compared with million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the increase in absolute dollars was due to materials and consulting fees related to product development and enhancement 
the change in engineering and development expenses as a percentage of revenue reflects the larger sales base and normal fluctuations in the scope of current research and development projects 
non operating income loss gain on foreign currency transactions 
we realized a  gain on foreign currency transactions for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  due to the changes in exchange rates between the united states dollar and euro 
gain on forward exchange contracts 
in the years ended december  and  we realized gains of  and  respectively  due to the increase in the fair market value of our forward exchange contracts which we purchased in connection with the debt incurred to acquire our facility in germany 
on february   the contracts expired and were not renewed 
interest income 
interest income relates to interest earned on our cash balances 
interest income for the year ended december  was  as compared with  for the year ended december  due to an increase in our cash balance 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased  or  to  for the year ended december   as compared with the year ended december  due to a decrease in the effective interest rate on our credit facility 
in may  we entered into a million credit facility with a bank to replace our existing line of credit 
the new line of credit bears interest at libor plus as compared with the previous line of libor plus 
although the nominal rate on the new facility is higher  the previous facility was burdened by the amortization of the cost of a third party guaranty 
income taxes 
an income tax benefit of million and a credit of million to additional paid in capital was recognized for the year ended december  this was primarily due to the reduction of the valuation allowance in the amount of million 
the credit to additional paid in capital was the result of a stock option deduction available to use in the current year and prior year deductions included in the deferred tax 
table of contents assets which were previously offset by the valuation allowance 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and the projection for future taxable income over the periods when the deferred tax assets are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize all of these deductible differences 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which will begin expiring in as of december   we had research and development credit carryforwards for federal and state purposes of approximately  and  respectively  which will begin expiring in for federal purposes and carryforward indefinitely for state purposes 
the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited under the provisions of internal revenue code section and similar state provisions 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in net working capital  an increase of million from million restated at december  our principal source of liquidity at december  consisted of our cash balance of million and investments in marketable securities of million 
for the year ended december   our sources of cash were net proceeds of million from our public offering and million from the exercise of stock options 
principal uses of cash for the year ended december  were investments in marketable securities of million  funds used to repurchase common stock of million  payments totaling approximately million to pay off debt outstanding at december   additions to long term assets of approximately million and dividends paid of  cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  the net effect on cash of operating  investing  and financing activities for the year ended december  was a decrease of million 
cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased million from december  to december  principal among the changes in assets and liabilities which used cash were increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
net accounts receivable at december  increased approximately million from december  the increase is primarily attributable to the increase in the sales volume experienced in specifically  our revenue increased million in the fourth quarter of when compared to the fourth quarter of days sales outstanding dso in accounts receivable lengthened from days for the year ended december  to days when measured at december  primarily attributable to the increase in the sales volume generated in the latter part of the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of net inventory increased approximately million from december  this increase was primarily due to increased levels of production in the fourth quarter which was geared to meet revenue at a level comparable with our expected rates of growth and the introduction of our new product  the waterlase md during the fourth quarter of inventory turnover declined to turns per year when measured at december  compared to restated turns per year when measured at december  as increased efficiencies in the manufacturing process of the waterlase md occur  we believe we will be able to manage inventory levels consistent with revenue growth 
this is not anticipated to occur until the later part of principal among the changes in assets and liabilities which provided cash were accounts payable  accrued liabilities and deferred revenue 
accounts payable increased million in relation to the growth in the business year over year 
in addition  we incurred an obligation for insurance premiums at the end of  a portion of which is reflected in accounts payable 
deferred revenue increased million during the year due to certain deliverables we must provide under customer purchase orders 
the customer is billed for these deliverables at the time of product shipment 
an example of a future deliverable is training 
of these obligations  approximately  will expire if the customer does not utilize them within six months from the time the product shipped 
revenue is recorded when these deliverables are satisfied 

table of contents several key indicators of liquidity are summarized in the following table in thousands  except ratio amounts restated fiscal years ended december  working capital cash used in provided by operations proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants current ratio accounts receivable collection period days inventory turnover on march   we completed a public offering of million shares of common stock 
net proceeds from the offering were million 
we incurred legal  accounting and related costs of approximately million which we had recorded as a reduction to additional paid in capital upon closing 
we used a portion of the net proceeds to repay million on the line of credit and  in debt 
the balance was invested in marketable securities consisting of us treasury bills with durations not exceeding two years 
the balance of the net proceeds of the offering have been used for general corporate purposes  working capital  and capital expenditures  including expenditures for expansion of our production capabilities  and the acquisition or investment in complementary businesses or products or the right to use complementary technologies 
in addition  the board of directors concluded that a stock repurchase program represented a use of capital that can enhance stockholder value 
therefore  in july of  we announced a stock repurchase program to acquire up to million shares over the next months 
in august of  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional  shares of our common stock  increasing the total share repurchase program to million shares of our common stock 
as of december  we have repurchased on the open market substantially all of the million shares at an average price of per share 
also in july of  the board of directors established a dividend policy that will remain in effect for an indefinite period of time and pays a regular cash dividend of per share every other month when declared by the board of directors 
the first dividend totaling  was declared on july  and paid on august  to stockholders of record on august  the second dividend totaling  was declared on october  and paid on october  to stockholders of record on october  the third dividend totaling  was declared on december  and paid on december  to stockholders of record on december  at december   we had million outstanding under a million revolving credit facility with a bank  which was due to expire at june  in the first quarter of  we used a portion of the net proceeds from our march  public offering to repay the million outstanding on the line of credit 
as of december   there were no amounts borrowed on the credit facility  however the facility was used and paid down at various times during the year 
borrowings under the facility bear interest at libor plus for minimum borrowing amounts of  and with two business days notice or at a variable rate equivalent to prime rate for amounts below  or with less than two business days notice and are payable on demand upon expiration of the facility 
all borrowings during were at prime rate 
borrowings also subject us to certain covenants  including  among other things  maintaining a minimum balance of cash including investments in us treasuries and tangible net worth  a specified ratio of current assets to current liabilities and a covenant to remain profitable 
in june  this credit facility was extended to june  and increased to million 
in june  this credit facility was extended to september  we were compliant with the covenants under the agreement with the exception to remain profitable on a quarterly basis 
in february  we notified our bank that we were in default under our covenants as of december  due to our operating loss for both the three months ended september  and december  in february  we obtained a waiver to this covenant as of december  a similar waiver was obtained for our third quarter of as of april  we became non compliant with our covenant relating to timely reporting and certification requirements due to the late filing of our form k for the year ended december  in july  we 
table of contents obtained a waiver to this covenant which extended until july  we intend to seek additional waivers until all of our late periodic reports have been filed and for any other non compliant covenants when and if any become necessary 
in january  we acquired the intellectual property portfolio of diodem llc diodem  consisting of certain us and international patents of which four were asserted against us  and settled the existing litigation between us and diodem  for consideration of million in cash   shares of common stock  and a five year warrant exercisable into  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
in addition  if certain criteria specified in the purchase agreement are satisfied on or before july   additional shares we have placed in escrow may be released to diodem and we will incur an expense equal to the fair market value of those shares at the time of their release 
these escrowed shares had a fair market value of  at the time of the binding letter of intent 
the total consideration was estimated to have a value of million  excluding the value of the shares held in escrow 
as of december   we accrued million for the settlement of the existing litigation 
in january  we recorded an intangible asset of  representing the estimated fair value of the intellectual property acquired 
as a result of the acquisition  diodem immediately withdrew its patent infringement claims against us and the case was formally dismissed on may  we did not pay and have no obligation to pay any royalties to diodem on past or future sales of our products 
the following table presents our expected cash requirements for contractual obligations outstanding as of december  for the years ending as indicated below operating leases diodem asset purchase agreement we believe that our current cash balances and marketable securities plus cash expected to be generated from our operations will be adequate to meet our capital requirements and sustain our operations  including the payment of our planned dividend and payments under the stock repurchase plan  for at least the next twelve months 
our capital requirements will depend on many factors  including among other things  the effects of any acquisitions we may pursue as well as the rate at which our business continues to grow  with corresponding demands for working capital and manufacturing capacity 
during the quarter ended march   we paid diodem the million in accordance with the asset purchase agreement and purchased a license for technology from surgilight for million of which million has been paid  as more fully described in item business of this form k 
we could be required or may elect to seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financing 
however  additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all

provided that certain inventory related costs  such as double freight and re handling might be so abnormal that they should be charged against current earnings rather than be included in the cost of inventory 
as amended by sfas no 
 the so abnormal criterion has been eliminated 
thus  all such abnormal costs are required to be treated as current period charges under all circumstances 
in addition  fixed production overhead should be allocated based on the normal capacity of the production facilities  with unallocated overhead charged to expense when incurred

sfas also provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable and for reporting a change when retrospective application is impracticable 
the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements is not an accounting change 
however  the reporting of an error correction involves adjustments to previously issued financial statements similar to those generally applicable to reporting an accounting change retrospectively

table of contents factors that may affect our operating results an investment in our common stock involves significant risk 
you should carefully consider the following risks and all the other information in this report  in addition to other information contained in our other filings with the us securities and exchange commission  or sec  before you decide to buy our common stock 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by any of the following risks 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and you could lose part or all of your investment 
risks relating to our business dentists and patients may be slow to adopt laser technologies  which could limit the market acceptance of our products 
our dental laser systems represent relatively new technologies in the dental market 
currently  only a small percentage of dentists use lasers to perform dental procedures 
our future success will depend on our ability to increase demand for our products by demonstrating the potential performance advantages of our laser systems over traditional methods of treatment and over competitive laser systems to a broad spectrum of dentists and patients 
historically  we have experienced long sales cycles because dentists have been  and may continue to be  slow to adopt new technologies on a widespread basis 
as a result  we generally are required to invest a significant amount of time and resources to educate customers about the benefits of our products in comparison to competing products and technologies before completing a sale  if any 
factors that may inhibit adoption of laser technologies by dentists include cost and concerns about the safety  efficacy and reliability of lasers 
for example  the selling price of our waterlase product is approximately  which is substantially above the cost of competing non laser technologies 
in order to make an investment in a waterlase product  a dentist generally would need to invest time to understand the technology  the benefits of such technology with respect to clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction  and the return on investment of the product 
absent an immediate competitive motivation  a dentist may not feel compelled to invest the time required to learn about the potential benefits of using a laser system 
in addition  economic pressure  caused for example by an economic slowdown  changes in healthcare reimbursement or by competitive factors in a specific market place  may make dentists reluctant to purchase substantial capital equipment or invest in new technologies 
patient acceptance will depend the recommendations of dentists and specialists  as well as other factors  including without limitation  the relative effectiveness  safety  reliability and comfort of our systems as compared to other instruments and methods for performing dental procedures 
the failure of dental lasers to achieve broad market acceptance would limit sales of our products and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
fluctuations in our revenue and operating results on a quarterly and annual basis could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
our revenue and operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
historically  we have experienced fluctuations in revenue from quarter to quarter due to seasonality 
revenue in the first quarter typically is lower than average and revenue in the fourth quarter typically is stronger than average due to the buying patterns of dental professionals 
in addition  revenue in the third quarter may be affected by vacation patterns which can cause revenue to be flat or lower than in the second quarter of the year 
if our quarterly revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors  analysts or our previously stated financial guidance  the price of our common stock could decline substantially 
factors that might cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenue and operating results include  among others  the following variation in demand for our products  including seasonality our ability to research  develop  market and sell new products and product enhancements in a timely manner 
table of contents our ability to control costs the size  timing  rescheduling or cancellation of orders from distributors the introduction of new products by competitors the length of and fluctuations in sales cycles the availability and reliability of components used to manufacture our products changes in our pricing policies or those of our suppliers and competitors  as well as increased price competition in general the mix of our domestic and international sales and the risks and uncertainties associated with international business costs associated with any future acquisitions of technologies and businesses limitations on our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards under the provisions of internal revenue code section and similar provisions under applicable state laws developments concerning the protection of our intellectual property rights natural catastrophic events such as hurricanes  floods and earthquakes  which can affect our ability to advertise  sell and distribute our products  including through national conferences held in regions in which these disasters strike 
global economic  political and social events  including international conflicts and acts of terrorism the expenses we incur are based  in large part  on our expectations regarding future revenue 
in particular  we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of our products 
since many of our costs are fixed in the short term  we may be unable to reduce expenses quickly enough to avoid losses if we experience a decrease in revenue 
accordingly  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indication of our future performance 
furthermore  as a result of the change in our revenue recognition policy in the third quarter of  our quarterly revenue and operating results for each of the four quarters ending december  may not be directly comparable to corresponding periods in the preceding year due to the difference in the timing of revenue recognition 
we may have difficulty achieving profitability and may experience additional losses 
although we recorded gross profit of million in  we also recorded a net loss of million  due in large part to our patent infringement legal settlement of approximately million and income tax provision associated with a valuation allowance against of our deferred tax asset in the net amount of million 
in order to achieve profitability  we must control our costs and increase net revenue through new sales 
failure to increase our net revenue and decrease our costs could cause our stock price to decline 
any failure to significantly expand sales of our products will negatively impact our business 
we currently handle a majority of the marketing  distribution and sales of our products 
in order to achieve our business objectives  we intend to significantly expand our marketing and sales efforts on a domestic and international basis 
we face significant challenges and risks in expanding  training  managing and retaining our sales and marketing teams  including managing geographically dispersed operations 
in addition  we rely on independent distributors to market and sell our products in a number of countries outside of the united states 
these distributors may not commit the necessary resources to effectively market and sell our products  and they may terminate their relationships with us at any time with limited notice 
if we are unable to expand our sales and marketing capabilities domestically and internationally  we may not be able to effectively commercialize our products  which could harm our business and cause the price of our common stock to decline 

table of contents components used in our products are complex in design  and any defects may not be discovered prior to shipment to customers  which could result in warranty obligations  reducing our revenue and increasing our cost 
in manufacturing our products  we depend upon third parties for the supply of various components 
many of these components require a significant degree of technical expertise to produce 
if our suppliers fail to produce components to specification  or if the suppliers  or we  use defective materials or workmanship in the manufacturing process  the reliability and performance of our products will be compromised 
if our products contain defects that cannot be repaired easily and inexpensively  we may experience loss of customer orders and delay in order fulfillment damage to our brand reputation increased cost of our warranty program due to product repair or replacement inability to attract new customers diversion of resources from our manufacturing and research and development departments into our service department legal action the occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing could materially harm our business 
our distributors have and may continue to cancel  reduce or delay orders of our products  any of which could reduce our revenue 
we employ direct sales representatives in certain european countries  however  we rely on independent distributors for a substantial portion of our sales outside of the united states 
for the year ended december   revenue to distributors accounted for approximately of our total sales  and no distributor accounted for more than of our revenue 
our ability to maintain or increase our revenue will depend in large part on our success in developing and maintaining relationships with our distributors 
the loss of a substantial number of our distributors or a substantial reduction in  cancellation of or change in the size or timing of orders from our distributors or any problems collecting accounts receivable from our distributors could reduce our revenue 
in addition  we may experience lengthy delays and incur substantial costs if we are required to replace distributors or retain direct sales representatives for such territories in the future 
we must continue to procure materials and components on commercially reasonable terms and on a timely basis to manufacture our products profitably 
we have some single source suppliers 
we have no written supply contracts with our key suppliers  instead  we purchase certain materials and components included in our products from a limited group of suppliers using purchase orders 
our business depends in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of materials and components in acceptable quality and quantities from our suppliers 
certain components of our products  particularly specialized components used in our lasers  are currently available only from a single source or limited sources 
for example  the crystal  fiber and hand pieces used in our waterlase system are each supplied by a separate single supplier 
we have not experienced material delays from these suppliers  however  an unexpected interruption in a single source supplier could create manufacturing delays  disrupt revenue and cause additional expense relating to the procurement of another supplier 
we may not be successful in the future in managing any shortage or delay of materials or components that we may experience  and any such an interruption could cause our business and results of operations to suffer 
we may not be able to compete successfully  which will cause our revenue and market share to decline 
we compete with a number of domestic and foreign companies that market traditional dental products  such as dental drills  as well as companies that market laser technologies in the dental and medical markets  including 
table of contents hoya conbio  a subsidiary of hoya photonics  opusdent ltd  a subsidiary of lumenis  kavo  deka dental corporation  ivoclar vivadent ag  and fotona dd if we do not compete successfully  our revenue and market share may decline 
some of our competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources than us  which may allow them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and to devote greater resources to the acquisition or development and introduction of enhanced products than we can 
the ability of our competitors to devote greater financial resources to product development requires us to work harder to distinguish our products through improving our product performance and pricing  protecting our intellectual property  continuously improving our customer support  accurately timing the introduction of new products and developing sustainable distribution channels worldwide 
in addition  we expect the rapid technological changes occurring in the healthcare industry to lead to the entry of new competitors  particularly if dental and medical lasers gain increasing market acceptance 
we must be able to anticipate technological changes and introduce enhanced products on a timely basis in order to grow and remain competitive 
new competitors or technological changes in laser products and methods could cause commoditization of our products  require price discounting or otherwise adversely affect our gross margins and our financial condition 
rapidly changing standards and competing technologies could harm demand for our products or result in significant additional costs 
the markets in which our products compete are subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in the regulatory environment  frequent introductions of new devices and evolving dental and surgical techniques 
competing products may emerge which could render our products uncompetitive or obsolete 
the process of developing new medical devices is inherently complex and requires regulatory approvals or clearances that can be expensive  time consuming and uncertain 
we cannot guarantee that we will successfully identify new product opportunities  identify new and innovative applications of our technology or be financially or otherwise capable of completing the research and development required to bring new products to market in a timely manner 
an inability to expand our product offerings or the application of our technology could limit our growth 
in addition  we may incur higher manufacturing costs if manufacturing processes or standards change  and we may need to replace  modify  design or build and install equipment  all of which would require additional capital expenditures 
if we are unable to attract and retain personnel necessary to operate our business  our ability to develop and market our products successfully could be harmed 
we are heavily dependent on our current executive officers and management 
the loss of any key employee or the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel  including engineers and sales and marketing personnel  could delay the development and introduction of  and harm our ability to sell  our products and harm our reputation 
we believe that our future success is highly dependent on the contributions of robert e 
grant  our president and chief executive officer  jeffrey w 
jones  our chief technology officer and john w 
hohener  our executive vice president and chief financial officer 
we have employment agreements with each of these individuals  which provide us with the ability to terminate their employment at will  subject to certain severance rights  however  their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace 
our future success also depends on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified management  engineering  sales and marketing  and other highly skilled technical personnel 
any problems that we experience with our manufacturing operations may harm our business 
we manufacture our products at our california and german facilities 
in order to grow our business  we must significantly expand our manufacturing capabilities to produce the systems and accessories necessary to meet demand 
we may encounter difficulties in increasing production of our products  including problems involving production capacity and yields  quality control and assurance  component supply and shortages of qualified personnel 
in addition  our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the us food and drug administration  state agencies and foreign regulatory agencies 
our success will depend in part upon 
table of contents our ability to manufacture our products in compliance with the us food and drug administration s quality system regulations and other regulatory requirements 
if we do not succeed in manufacturing our products on a timely basis and with acceptable manufacturing costs while at the same time maintaining good quality control and complying with applicable regulatory requirements  our business will be harmed 
changes in government regulation or the inability to obtain or maintain necessary government approvals could harm our business 
our products are subject to extensive government regulation  both in the united states and in other countries 
to clinically test  manufacture and market products for human use  we must comply with regulations and safety standards set by the us food and drug administration and comparable state and foreign agencies 
regulations adopted by the us food and drug administration are wide ranging and govern  among other things  product design  development  manufacture and testing  labeling  storage  advertising and sales 
generally  products must meet regulatory standards as safe and effective for their intended use before being marketed for human applications 
the clearance process is expensive  time consuming and uncertain 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements of the us food and drug administration can result in an enforcement action which may include a variety of sanctions  including fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of our products  operating restrictions  partial suspension or total shutdown of production and criminal prosecution 
the failure to receive or maintain requisite approvals for the use of our products or processes  or significant delays in obtaining such approvals  could prevent us from developing  manufacturing and marketing products and services necessary for us to remain competitive 
in addition  unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or the adoption of new requirements could impose significant costs and burdens on us  which could increase our operating expenses and harm our financial condition 
regulatory proceedings relating to the restatement of our consolidated financial statements could divert management s attention and resources 
we restated our previously issued financial statements in september of to reflect a change in the timing of revenue recognition 
in addition  we are now restating our consolidated financial statements for the and fiscal years  the four quarters of and the first three fiscal quarters of due to a number of factors discussed in note to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this form k 
we have received informal requests from the sec to voluntarily provide information relating to the september restatement of our consolidated financial statements 
we have provided information to the sec and  when we receive any additional requests for information  we intend to continue to do so 
in accordance with its normal practice  the sec has not advised us when its inquiry might be concluded 
if the sec elects to request additional information from us or commences further proceedings  including as a result of our current restatements  responding to such requests or proceedings could divert management s attention and resources 
additionally  any negative developments arising from such requests or proceedings could harm our business and cause the price of our common stock to decline 
we may have difficulty managing any growth that we might experience 
if we continue to experience growth in our operations  our operational and financial systems  procedures and controls may need to be expanded  which will place significant demands on our management  distract management from our business plan and increase expenses 
our success will depend substantially on the ability of our management team to manage any growth effectively 
these challenges may include  among others maintaining our cost structure at an appropriate level based on the revenue we generate managing manufacturing expansion projects implementing and improving our operational and financial systems  procedures and controls managing operations in multiple locations and multiple time zones 
table of contents in addition  we incur significant legal  accounting  insurance and other expenses as a result of being a public company 
the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the sec and nasdaq  have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies 
we expect these new rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly 
we also expect these new rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to maintain director and officer insurance and  from time to time  we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur significantly higher costs to maintain the same or similar coverage 
as a result  it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers 
we continue to evaluate and monitor developments with respect to these rules  and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs 
if we fail to secure or protect our intellectual property rights  competitors may be able to use our technologies  which could weaken our competitive position  reduce our revenue or increase our costs 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products and technology  to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing the intellectual property of others 
we rely on patents to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products 
we currently possess a number of issued patents and patent applications with respect to our products and technology  however  we cannot assure you that any additional patents will be issued  that the scope of any patent protection will be effective in helping us address our competition or that any of our patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged 
it is also possible that our competitors may independently develop similar products  duplicate our products or design products that circumvent our patents 
additionally  the laws of foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately  our competitive position and financial condition may be harmed 
we may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights 
we face substantial uncertainty regarding the impact that other parties intellectual property positions will have on the markets for dental and other medical lasers 
the medical technology industry has in the past been characterized by a substantial amount of litigation and related administrative proceedings regarding patents and intellectual property rights 
from time to time  we have received  and expect to continue to receive  notices of claims of infringement  misappropriation or misuse of other parties proprietary rights 
some of these claims may lead to litigation 
we may not prevail in any future intellectual property infringement litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in litigation 
any claims  with or without merit  may be time consuming and distracting to management  result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays 
adverse determinations in litigation could subject us to significant liability and could result in the loss of proprietary rights 
a successfully lawsuit against us could also force us to cease selling or redesign products that incorporate the infringed intellectual property 
additionally  we could be required to seek a license from the holder of the intellectual property to use the infringed technology  and it is possible that we may not be able to obtain a license on acceptable terms  or at all 
any of the foregoing adverse events could seriously harm our business 
we have significant international revenue and are subject to risks associated with operating in international markets 
international revenue comprise a significant portion of our revenue and we intend to continue to pursue and expand our international business activities 
for the fiscal  international sales accounted for approximately of our revenue  as compared to approximately of our revenue in fiscal and approximately of our revenue in fiscal political and economic conditions outside the united states could make it difficult for us to increase our international revenue or to operate abroad 
international operations  including our operations in germany  are subject to many inherent risks  including among others adverse changes in tariffs and trade restrictions political  social and economic instability and increased security concerns 
table of contents fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates longer collection periods and difficulties in collecting receivables from foreign entities exposure to different legal standards transportation delays and difficulties of managing international distribution channels reduced protection for our intellectual property in some countries difficulties in obtaining domestic and foreign export  import and other governmental approvals  permits and licenses and compliance with foreign laws the imposition of governmental controls unexpected changes in regulatory or certification requirements difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations potentially adverse tax consequences and the complexities of foreign value added tax systems we believe that international revenue will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue  and we intend to further expand our international operations 
our direct revenue in europe is denominated principally in euros  while our revenue in other international markets is in us dollars 
as a result  an increase in the relative value of the dollar against the euro would lead to less income from sales denominated in euros  unless we increase prices  which may not be possible due to competitive conditions in europe 
we could experience losses from european transactions if the relative value of the dollar were to increase in the future 
we do not currently engage in any transactions as a hedge against risks of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations  although we may consider doing so in the future 
revenue generated from products manufactured at our german facility accounted for of our revenue in fiscal  of our revenue in fiscal and approximately of our revenue in fiscal expenses relating to our manufacturing operations in germany are paid in euros  therefore  an increase in the value of the euro relative to the dollar would increase the expenses associated with our german manufacturing operations and reduce our earnings 
in addition  we may experience difficulties associated with managing our operations remotely and complying with german regulatory and legal requirements for maintaining our manufacturing operations in that country 
any of these factors may adversely affect our future international revenue and manufacturing operations and  consequently  negatively impact our business and operating results 
we may not address successfully problems encountered in connection with any future acquisition 
we expect to continue to consider opportunities to acquire or make investments in other technologies  products and businesses that could enhance our capabilities  complement our current products or expand the breadth of our markets or customer base 
we have limited experience in acquiring other businesses and technologies 
potential and completed acquisitions and strategic investments involve numerous risks  including  among others problems assimilating the purchased technologies  products or business operations problems maintaining uniform standards  procedures  controls and policies unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition diversion of management s attention from our core business adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers risks associated with entering new markets in which we have no or limited prior experience potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses increased legal and accounting costs as a result of the newly adopted rules and regulations related to the sarbanes oxley act of 
table of contents if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions and strategic investments  our management team may be distracted from our day to day operations  our business may be disrupted and our operating results may suffer 
in addition  if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  our stockholders would be diluted 
if our customers cannot obtain third party reimbursement for their use of our products  they may be less inclined to purchase our products 
our products are generally purchased by dental or medical professionals who have various billing practices and patient mixes 
such practices range from primarily private pay to those who rely heavily on third party payors  such as private insurance or government programs 
in the united states  third party payors review and frequently challenge the prices charged for medical services 
in many foreign countries  the prices for dental services are predetermined through government regulation 
payors may deny coverage and reimbursement if they determine that the procedure was not medically necessary  such as a cosmetic procedure  or that the device used in the procedure was investigational 
we believe that most of the procedures being performed with our current products generally are reimbursable  with the exception of cosmetic applications  such as tooth whitening 
for the portion of dentists who rely heavily on third party reimbursement  the inability to obtain reimbursement for services using our products could deter them from purchasing or using our products 
we cannot predict the effect of future healthcare reforms or changes in financing for health and dental plans 
any such changes could have an adverse effect on the ability of a dental or medical professional to generate a return on investment using our current or future products 
such changes could act as disincentives for capital investments by dental and medical professionals and could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations 
we are party to securities and derivative litigation that distracts our management  is expensive to conduct and seeks a damage award against us 
we and certain of our current and former officers have been recently named as defendants in several putative shareholder class action lawsuits filed in the united states district court for the central district of california 
the complaints purport to seek unspecified damages on behalf of an alleged class of persons who purchased our common stock between october  and july  the complaints allege that we and our officers violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose material information about the demand for our products and the fact that we would not achieve the alleged forecasted growth 
the claimed misrepresentations include certain statements in our press releases and the registration statement we filed in connection with our public offering of stock in march in addition  three stockholders have filed derivative actions in the state court in california seeking recovery on behalf of biolase  alleging  among other things  breach of fiduciary duties by those individual defendants and members of the biolase board of directors 
we have not yet formally responded to any of the actions and no discovery has been conducted by any of the parties 
this litigation presents a distraction to our management  is expensive to conduct  and if we are unsuccessful in defending this litigation  may result in damage awards against us that would harm our financial condition and operating results 
material increases in interest rates may harm our sales 
we currently sell our products primarily to dentists in general practice 
these dentists often purchase our products with funds they secure through various financing arrangements with third party financial institutions  including credit facilities and short term loans 
if interest rates increase  these financing arrangements will be more expensive to our dental customers  which would effectively increase the price of our products to our customers and  thereby  may decrease overall demand for our products 
any reduction in the sales of our products would cause our business to suffer 
product liability claims against us could be costly and could harm our reputation 
the sale of dental and medical devices involves the inherent risk of product liability claims against us 
we currently maintain product liability insurance on a per occurrence basis with a limit of million per 
table of contents occurrence and million in the aggregate for all occurrences 
the insurance is subject to various standard coverage exclusions  including damage to the product itself  losses from recall of our product and losses covered by other forms of insurance such as workers compensation 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully defend any claims against us  nor can we be certain that our insurance will cover all liabilities resulting from such claims 
in addition  there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such insurance in the future on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
any product liability claims brought against us could harm our reputation and cause our business to suffer 
our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards may be limited 
section of the internal revenue code of generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in its stock ownership 
in  we completed an analysis to determine the applicability of the annual limitations imposed by section caused by previous changes in our stock ownership and determined that such limitations should not be significant 
based on our analysis  we believe that  as of december   approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards were available to us for federal income tax purposes 
of this amount  approximately million is available to offset federal taxable income or the taxable income generated in future years 
additional net operating loss carryforwards will become available at the rate of approximately million per year for the years through however  any ownership changes qualifying under section including changes resulting from or affected by our recent public offering or our stock repurchase plan may adversely affect our ability to use our remaining net operating loss carryforwards 
if we lose our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards  any income we generate will be subject to tax earlier than it would be if we were able to use net operating loss carryforwards  resulting in lower profits 
our business is capital intensive and the failure to obtain capital could require that we curtail capital expenditures 
to remain competitive  we must continue to make significant investments in the development of our products  the expansion of our sales and marketing activities and the expansion of our operating and management infrastructure as we increase sales domestically and internationally 
we expect that substantial capital will be required to expand our operations and fund working capital for anticipated growth 
we may need to raise additional funds through further debt or equity financings  which may affect the percentage ownership of existing holders of common stock and which may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock or may be issued at a discount to the market price of our common stock thereby resulting in dilution to our existing stockholders 
we may not be able to raise additional capital on reasonable terms  or at all 
if we cannot raise the required capital when needed  we may not be able to satisfy the demands of existing and prospective customers and may lose revenue and market share 
the following factors among others could affect our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all our results of operations general economic conditions and conditions in the electronics industry the perception of our business in the capital markets our ratio of debt to equity our financial condition our business prospects interest rates 
table of contents if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital in the future  we may have to curtail our capital expenditures 
any curtailment of our capital expenditures could result in a reduction in revenue  reduced quality of our products  increased manufacturing costs for our products  harm to our reputation  reduced manufacturing efficiencies or other harm to our business 
we have adopted anti takeover defenses that could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company and may affect the price of our common stock 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and stockholder rights plan could make it difficult for any party to acquire us  even though an acquisition might be beneficial to our stockholders 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
in december  we adopted a stockholder rights plan pursuant to which one preferred stock purchase right is distributed to our stockholders for each share of our common stock held by them 
in connection with the stockholder rights plan  the board of directors may issue up to  shares of series b junior participating cumulative preferred stock which may be increased by up to  more shares out of undesignated preferred stock described in the paragraph below that is available under our certificate of incorporation 
if any party acquires or more of our outstanding common stock or commences a tender offer to acquire or more of our outstanding stock  the holders of these rights other than the party acquiring the position or commencing the tender offer will be able to purchase the underlying junior participating preferred stock as a way to discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company 
following the acquisition of or more of our stock by any person  if we are acquired by or merged with any other entity  holders of these rights other than the party acquiring the position will be able to purchase shares of common stock of the acquiring or surviving entity as a further means to discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company 
in addition  under our certificate of incorporation  the board of directors has the power to authorize the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock that is currently undesignated  and to designate the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without further vote or action by the stockholders 
accordingly  our board of directors may issue preferred stock with terms that could have preference over and adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock 
the issuance of any preferred stock may delay  defer or prevent a change in control of our company discourage bids for the common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock discourage acquisition proposals or tender offers for our shares our common stock could be diluted by the conversion of outstanding convertible securities 
we have issued and will continue to issue outstanding convertible securities in the form of options and warrants as incentive compensation for services performed by our employees  directors  consultants and others 
we have options to purchase  shares of our common stock outstanding  of which options to purchase  shares of common stock are exercisable 
in addition  we have issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
if these options or warrants were exercised  it would dilute the ownership of our stock and could adversely affect our common stock s market price 
our financial outlook could be affected by changes in the accounting rules which govern the recognition of stock based compensation expenses 
we measure compensation expense for our employee stock compensation plans under the intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under this method  we recognized no compensation charges related to stock compensation plans in because the exercise price of all options granted under these plans was equal to the fair market value of the underlying 
table of contents common stock on the grant date  and therefore no stock based employee compensation cost is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
the financial accounting standards board has announced changes to accounting rules concerning the recognition of stock option compensation expense 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal when these changes are expected to be implemented  we and other companies will be required to measure compensation expense using the fair value method  which will adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our losses by the additional amount of such stock option charges 
our internal controls and procedures need to be improved 
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting 
our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of december   management used the criteria described in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 
a material weakness is a control deficiency  or combination of control deficiencies  that results in a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
management determined that material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting existed as of december   and these material weaknesses contributed to the restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the full fiscal year  the first  second  third and fourth quarters of  the full fiscal year and the first  second and third fiscal quarters of these material weaknesses are discussed under item a  controls and procedures 
because of these material weaknesses  management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december  based on the criteria of the internal control integrated framework 
further  the material weaknesses identified resulted in an adverse opinion by our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
if we are unable to substantially improve our internal controls  our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis will continue to be adversely affected  which could have a material adverse affect on our ability to operate our business 
please see item a controls and procedures for more information regarding the measures we have undertaken to implement  and which we intend to implement during the course of  which are designed to remediate the deficiencies in our internal controls described in the management s report on internal control over financial reporting 
the costs of remediating such deficiencies in our internal controls will adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  even after the remedial measures discussed in item a controls and procedures are fully implemented  our internal controls will not prevent all potential error and fraud  because any control system  no matter how well designed  can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system will be achieved 
our failure to comply with certain conditions required for our common stock to be listed on the nasdaq national market could result in the delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq national market 
as a result of our failure to timely file our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  and our quarterly report on form q for the fiscal quarter ended march   and certain required restatements of our financial statements for prior periods  we were not in full compliance with nasdaq marketplace rule c  which requires us to make  on a timely basis  all filings with the sec required by the exchange act 
we are required to comply with nasdaq marketplace rule c as a condition for our common stock to continue to be listed on the nasdaq national market the nasdaq market 
we received notice on july  that the nasdaq market has granted us an extension of time until august  in which to file our form k for the fiscal year ended december  form k  certain restatements with respect to our historical financial statements  the form q for the fiscal quarter ended march  first quarter form q and to otherwise meet all necessary listing standards of the nasdaq market 

table of contents we have restated our historical financial statements and have filed i this form k that includes  in addition to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   restated consolidated financial statements as of december  and the two years then ended and ii amended form qs for the fiscal quarters ended march   june  and september  the form q as that include restated financial statements for the prior comparative periods as well 
at this time  we intend to seek an additional extension from nasdaq to file our first quarter form q 
there is no assurance that nasdaq will grant any extension to file our first quarter form q 
we cannot give any assurances as to what actions nasdaq may take  but such actions could include delisting our shares from the nasdaq market 
in addition  if we are unable to comply with any conditions for continued listing required by nasdaq  then our shares of common stock are subject to immediate delisting from the nasdaq market 
if our shares of common stock are delisted from the nasdaq market  they may not be eligible to trade on any national securities exchange or the over the counter market 
if our common stock is no longer traded through a market system  it may not be liquid  which could affect its price 
in addition  we may be unable to obtain future equity financing  or use our common stock as consideration for mergers or other business combinations 
we intend to appeal any decision to delist our shares from the nasdaq market  but cannot provide any assurance that our appeal will be successful 
any such appeal will not stay the decision to delist our shares 
risks relating to our industry changes in government regulation or the inability to obtain or maintain necessary government approvals could harm our business

failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements of the us food and drug administration can result in an enforcement action which may include a variety of sanctions  including fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of our products  operating restrictions  partial suspension or total shutdown of production and criminal prosecution 
failure to receive or maintain requisite approvals for the use of our products or processes and failure to receive clearance for the modification of existing products  or significant delays in obtaining such approvals  could prevent us from developing  manufacturing and marketing products and services necessary for us to remain competitive 
in addition  unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or the adoption of new requirements could impose significant costs and burdens on us  which could increase our operating expenses  reduce our revenue and profits  and result in operating losses

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in conjunction with a portion of the debt due in associated with the purchase of our production facility in germany  we entered into a forward contract to purchase approximately  of euros at an exchange rate of 
on february   the contracts expired and were not renewed  resulting in a cumulative realized gain on the contracts of  since february   we have not engaged in transactions to offset currency fluctuations 
in october  we paid off the debt on our german facility 
the value of the german facility itself as stated in dollars on our balance sheet will vary as the exchange rate of the dollar and the euro varies 
our revenue in europe is denominated principally in euros  and our revenue in other international markets is denominated in dollars 
as a result  an increase in the relative value of the dollar to the euro would lead to less income from revenue denominated in euros  unless we increase prices  which may not be possible due to competitive conditions in europe 
additionally  since expenses relating to our manufacturing operations in germany are paid in euros  an increase in the value of the euro relative to the dollar would increase the expenses associated with our german manufacturing operations and reduce our earnings 
we currently have a line of credit in the amount of million at the variable interest rate equivalent to the prime rate for advances less than  and with less than two business days notice  and at libor plus for advances of  or more and with two business days notice 
this line of credit originally expired on june  and was extended to september  there was no outstanding bank debt at december  our primary objective in managing our cash balances has been preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity to meet our operating needs 
most of our excess cash balances are invested in a money market account and us treasury securities in which there is minimal interest rate risk
