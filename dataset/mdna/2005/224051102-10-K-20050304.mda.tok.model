item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general cox radio  inc is a leading national radio broadcast company whose business is acquiring  developing and operating radio stations located throughout the united states 
cox enterprises indirectly owns approximately of the common stock of cox radio and has approximately of the voting power of cox radio 
our primary source of revenues is the sale of local and national advertising for broadcast on our radio stations 
historically  approximately and of our net revenues have been generated from local and national advertising  respectively 
in addition to the sale of advertising time for cash  our stations also exchange advertising time for goods  services or programming  which can be 
table of contents used by the stations in their business operations 
we generally confine the use of such trade transactions to promotional items or services for which we would otherwise have paid cash 
barter transactions for programming are used to supplement station program offerings 
advertising spots given up under programming arrangements are based on contractual terms 
in addition  it is our general policy not to pre empt advertising spots paid for in cash with advertising spots paid for in trade 
our most significant station operating expenses are employees salaries and benefits  commissions  programming expenses and advertising and promotional expenditures 
our revenues vary throughout the year 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  our revenues and operating income are typically lowest in the first quarter 
our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotional expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of the advertising and promotion is realized in future periods 
critical accounting estimates use of estimates our accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and conform to general practices within the radio broadcasting industry 
an accounting estimate would be a critical accounting estimate for purposes of the disclosure in this report only if it meets two criteria 
first  the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made 
second  it must be the case that different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
the estimates and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors  which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to intangible assets  bad debts  contingencies and litigation  income taxes and fair value of financial instruments as discussed in quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk below 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions and could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and results of operations for the reporting periods 
we believe the following are the critical accounting estimates that require the most significant judgments and assumptions and are particularly susceptible to a significant change in the preparation of our financial statements 
impairment of intangible assets intangible assets consist primarily of fcc broadcast licenses  but also include goodwill and certain other intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
 on january   cox radio ceased amortization of goodwill and fcc licenses  which are indefinite lived intangible assets 
other intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the contractual lives of the assets 
cox radio evaluates its fcc licenses for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
fcc licenses are evaluated for impairment at the market level using the direct method 
if the carrying amount of fcc licenses is greater than their estimated fair value in a given market  the carrying amount of fcc licenses in that market is reduced to its estimated fair value 
cox radio also evaluates goodwill in each of its reporting units markets for impairment annually  or more frequently if certain circumstances are present  using the residual method 
if the carrying amount of goodwill in a reporting unit is greater than the implied value of goodwill for that reporting unit determined from the estimated fair value of the reporting units  the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit is reduced to its estimated fair value 
cox radio utilizes independent appraisals in testing fcc licenses and goodwill for impairment 
these appraisals principally use the discounted cash flow methodology 
this income approach consists of a quantitative model  which incorporates variables such as market advertising revenues  market revenue share projections  anticipated operating profit margins and various discount rates 
the variables used in the analysis reflect historical station and advertising market growth trends  as well as anticipated performance and market conditions 
multiples of operating cash flow are also considered 
cox radio evaluates amortizing intangible assets for recoverability when circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred  using an undiscounted cash flow methodology 
if the future undiscounted cash flows for the intangible asset are less than net book value  net book value is reduced to the estimated fair value 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts and notes receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific party s inability to meet its financial obligations  we record a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected 
for all other parties  the evaluation considers the balance of aged receivables  the nature and volume of the portfolio  specific problem accounts and notes receivable  and economic conditions that may affect the debtor s ability to repay  and such other factors as  in our judgment  deserve recognition under existing economic conditions 
accounts and notes receivable are charged off to the allowance when  in our opinion  such receivables are deemed to be uncollectible 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
in addition  we consider the customer s creditworthiness prior to revenue recognition 
contingencies and litigation on an on going basis  we evaluate our exposures related to contingencies and litigation and record a liability when available information indicates that a liability is probable and estimable 
we also disclose significant matters that are reasonably possible to result in a loss or are probable but not estimable 
income tax estimates the provision for income taxes is based on our current period income  changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities  changes in our operations in various jurisdictions  income tax rates and tax positions taken on tax returns 
we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 
significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the application and interpretation of complex tax laws and regulations 
we establish accruals when  despite our belief that reported taxable income is fully supportable  we believe that challenges are probable and that we may not succeed 
these challenges could arise from a variety of tax issues such as the deductibility of certain expenses  allocations of income and expense between states  the tax basis of assets  acquisitions and disposals 
in the normal course of business  our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities  and we accrue a liability when we believe that it is probable that we will be assessed 
differences between the estimated and actual amounts determined upon ultimate resolution  individually or in the aggregate  are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flows of any one period 
in connection with the conclusion of federal income tax audits for the years  we expect to pay approximately million in taxes related to certain radio station transactions completed during the audit period 
of this total amount  million was paid in  and we expect to pay the remainder in cox radio had previously provided for the possibility of this outcome 
also in  we reclassified approximately million of deferred tax liabilities  the amount not already classified as current  into income taxes payable 
this reclassification then required a corresponding reclassification between deferred tax expense and current tax expense 
results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto

liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations and cash borrowed under our bank credit facility 
net cash from operations results primarily from net income adjusted for non cash items  including depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes  gains or losses on sales of radio stations  goodwill impairment and changes in working capital accounts 
in comparing to  net cash provided by operating activities decreased million primarily due to a million payment made in connection with the conclusion of the income tax audits for the years see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion and changes in working capital 
in comparing to  net cash provided by operating activities decreased million mostly attributable to changes in working capital 
we expect future net cash provided by operating activities to provide sufficient funding for our operations in the near term 
primary uses of liquidity include debt service as discussed below  acquisitions  capital expenditures and investment in signal upgrades 
the following table summarizes our acquisitions  capital expenditures and investment in signal upgrades for the past three years amounts in thousands acquisitions capital expenditures investment in signal upgrades we have an effective universal shelf registration statement under which we may from time to time offer and issue debentures  notes  bonds and other evidence of indebtedness  forward contracts in respect of any such indebtedness  shares of preferred stock  shares of class a common stock  warrants  stock purchase contracts  stock purchase units and stock purchase rights and two financing trusts sponsored by cox radio may offer and issue preferred securities of the trusts

we expect capital expenditures to be between million and million for additional cash requirements  including funds for acquisitions  will be funded from various sources  including the proceeds from bank financing  intercompany advances from cox enterprises and  if or when appropriate  issuances of securities 
debt service on june   we replaced our existing million  five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility and million day senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a million  five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility 
the interest rate for the new five year facility is  at our option the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds borrowing rate plus the london interbank offered rate plus a spread based on the credit ratings of our senior long term debt  the bid rate for the purchase of certificates of deposit of equal principal amount and maturity plus a spread based on the credit ratings of our senior long term debt  or the federal funds borrowing rate plus a spread based on the credit ratings of our senior long term debt 
the new five year facility requires us to pay commitment fees on the unused portion of the total amount available  which fees range from to depending on the credit rating of our senior long term debt 
the five year facility contains  among other provisions  specified leverage and interest coverage requirements  the terms of which are defined within the credit facility 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
the credit facility contains events of default based on i the failure to pay when due other debt  the outstanding amount of which exceeds million  after the expiration of applicable grace periods and ii the acceleration of other debt  the outstanding amount of which exceeds million 
we are not in default under our credit facility 
at december   we had million of outstanding indebtedness under the five year facility with million available 
the interest rate applied to amounts due under the bank credit facility was at december  at december   cox radio had approximately million of outstanding indebtedness under the old five year facility with million available  and no amounts outstanding under our old day facility with million available 
the interest rate applied to amounts due under the old bank credit facilities was at december  since the interest rate is variable  the recorded balance of the credit facilities approximates fair value 
see note for a discussion of our interest rate swap agreements 
in may  we repaid the million principal amount of our notes at maturity using funds from the five year revolving credit facility 
we currently have million in outstanding debt securities  as described below dollar amounts in thousands principal amount interest rate maturity may february at december  and  the estimated aggregate fair value of the notes was approximately million and million  respectively  based on quoted market prices 
the notes due on may  were excluded from current liabilities because cox radio intends to refinance this obligation on a long term basis and currently has the ability to do so under its new five year credit facility 
this credit facility had unused capacity of million as of december  cox radio may also refinance this obligation through the issuance of long term debt or equity securities depending on market conditions and other factors 
at december  and  the estimated aggregate fair value of these notes was approximately million and million  respectively  based on quoted market prices 

table of contents from time to time  we use excess cash flows from operations to prepay a portion of amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility prior to maturity 
subsequent to december   we prepaid million on our revolving credit facility 
accordingly  this amount has been reclassified as the current portion of notes payable in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of lease commitments and contracts for sports programming and on air personalities and the guarantee discussed below 
we do not have any majority owned subsidiaries that are not included in our consolidated financial statements  nor do we have any interests in or relationships with any variable interest entities 
in april  we entered into a jsa for kgmz fm serving honolulu  hawaii and simultaneously guaranteed honolulu broadcasting  inc s financing for the acquisition of this station in the amount of million 
we provided sales and marketing services under a jsa to this station pursuant to which we sold advertising on the station  which it recorded as revenues  provided marketing services for the station  and paid a jsa fee to honolulu broadcasting in an amount sufficient to service this debt 
in february  we entered into another jsa agreement with honolulu broadcasting to provide sales and marketing services for warv fm  serving richmond  virginia  and simultaneously guaranteed honolulu broadcasting s financing for the acquisition of this station in the amount of million 
the total guarantee at december  was million 
during february  honolulu broadcasting sold warv fm  terminating the related jsa and repaid the indebtedness of million 
this reduced the amount of our guarantee from million to million 
in august  we entered into an agreement with salem communications to acquire krtr am formerly khnr am and kkne am formerly khcm am serving the honolulu  hawaii market 
as part of the transaction  we exercised our option to acquire kgmz fm from honolulu broadcasting and exchanged the assets of kgmz fm for the two am stations 
the parties closed the transaction on january  in order to determine the fair value of kgmz fm  a third party appraisal was performed 
the station s appraised value was approximately million 
as a result of this valuation  the million of bank financing which we had guaranteed with respect to kgmz fm was collateralized by assets worth less than the loan principal and  therefore  we accrued an estimated loss on loan guarantee of million in the third quarter of upon closing this transaction in january  the loan guarantee of million was terminated 
in february  we agreed to guarantee the borrowings of a third party of up to million to enable that party to purchase two stations and assist us in a signal upgrade project for one of our stations 
this guarantee expires in february if our signal upgrade is approved by the fcc  then we are likely to purchase the stations and performance under the guarantee will not be necessary 
if the signal upgrade is not approved  our guarantee will be extinguished either through sale of the stations or through new financing arranged by the owner of the stations 
we believe that while the value of the stations currently may be insufficient to repay the outstanding debt in full  any shortfall would be immaterial 
summary disclosures about contractual obligations we also have various commitments under the following types of contracts non cancelable operating leases  long term debt  interest payments on long term debt  and other operating contracts  including contracts for sports programming and on air personalities

cox radio plans to refinance this obligation on a long term basis using proceeds from its revolving credit facility 
amounts due in consist of million aggregate principal amount of the notes due at maturity 
amounts due in consist of million due upon and assuming the expiration of our five year credit facility 
these amounts represent future cash interest payments related to debt obligations based on the fixed and variable rates specified in our indenture and credit agreements  including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements 
payments related to variable rate debt under our five year credit facility are based on the minimum specified margin plus the base rate  libor  in effect at december   and the portion of such variable rate debt subject to interest rates swaps is adjusted for and based on the fixed rate in such interest rate swaps 
these estimates assume that debt is repaid and not refinanced at 
table of contents maturity 
our future interest payments could differ materially from amounts indicated in the table due to future operational and financing needs  market factors and other currently unanticipated events 
these amounts are subject to change if cox radio refinances is million due in on a long term basis as previously noted above 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date 
however  there can be no assurance that a high rate of inflation in the future would not have an adverse impact on our operating results 
transactions with affiliated companies cox radio receives certain management services from  and has entered into certain transactions with  cox enterprises 
costs of the management services that are allocated to cox radio are based on actual direct costs incurred or on cox enterprises estimate of expenses relative to the management services provided to other subsidiaries of cox enterprises 
cox radio believes that these allocations were made on a reasonable basis  and that receiving these management services from cox enterprises creates cost efficiencies  however  there has been no study or any attempt to obtain quotes from third parties to determine what the cost of obtaining such services from third parties would have been 
the services and transactions described below have been reviewed by cox radio s audit committee  which has determined that such services and transactions are fair and in the best interest of cox radio

in connection with these management services  cox radio reimburses cox enterprises for payments made to third party vendors for certain goods and services provided to cox radio under arrangements made by cox enterprises on behalf of cox enterprises and its affiliates  including cox radio 
cox radio believes such arrangements result in cox radio receiving such goods and services at more attractive pricing than cox radio would be able to secure separately 
such reimbursed expenditures include insurance premiums for coverage through cox enterprises insurance program  which provides coverage for all of its affiliates  including cox radio 
rather than self insuring these risks  cox enterprises purchases insurance for a fixed premium cost from several insurance companies  including an insurance company indirectly owned by descendants of governor james m

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk cox radio is exposed to a number of financial market risks in the ordinary course of business 
cox radio s primary financial market risk exposure pertains to changes in interest rates 
cox radio has examined exposures to these risks and concluded that none of the exposures in these areas are material to cash flows or earnings 
cox radio has engaged in several strategies to manage these market risks 
cox radio s indebtedness under its various financing arrangements creates interest rate risk 
in connection with each debt issuance and as a result of continual monitoring of interest rates  cox radio has entered into an interest rate swap agreement for purposes of managing borrowing costs 

table of contents pursuant to the interest rate swap agreement  cox radio has exchanged its floating rate interest obligations on million in notional principal amount of debt for a fixed interest rate 
this agreement has an annual fixed rate of and a remaining maturity of years 
concurrently with the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  in january  cox radio formally designated this agreement as a cash flow hedge as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
cox radio is exposed to a credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the interest rate swap agreement 
however  cox radio does not anticipate nonperformance by such counterparty  and no material loss would be expected in the event of the counterparty s nonperformance 
the estimated fair value of this swap agreement  based on current market rates  approximated a net payable of million at december  the estimated fair value of the two swaps outstanding at december  approximated a net payable of million the fair value of the swap agreement at december  is included in other long term liabilities according to the maturity date of the swap 
the market risk for the interest rate swap is mitigated as the variable rate received is hedged to the variable rate paid on the credit facility 
the determination of the estimated fair value of cox radio s fixed rate debt is subject to the effects of interest rate risk 
the estimated fair value of cox radio s fixed rate debt instruments at december  was million  compared to a carrying amount of million 
the estimated fair value of cox radio s fixed rate debt instruments at december  was million  compared to a carrying amount of million 
the effect of a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to increase the estimated fair value of cox radio s fixed rate debt instruments from million to million at december   and from million to million at december  the estimated fair values of debt instruments are based on discounted cash flow analyses using cox radio s borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements and dealer quotations 
the revolving credit facilities and cox enterprises borrowings bear interest based on current market rates and  thus  approximate fair value 
cox radio is exposed to interest rate volatility with respect to these variable rate debt instruments 
with respect to financial instruments  cox radio has estimated the fair values of such instruments using available market information and valuation methodologies that it believes to be appropriate 
considerable judgment  however  is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that cox radio would realize or pay in a current market exchange
