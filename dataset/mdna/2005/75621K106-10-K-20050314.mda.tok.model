funds from operations ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as net income or loss  excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable properties plus real estate depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company presents ffo because it considers it an important supplemental measure of the company s operating performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits  many of which present ffo when reporting their results 
ffo is intended to exclude gaap historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets  which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes ratably over time 
historically  however  real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions 
as a result  ffo provides a performance measure that  when compared year over year  reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs  development activities  interest costs and other matters without the inclusion of depreciation and amortization  providing perspective that may not necessarily be apparent from net income 
the company computes ffo in accordance with the standards established by nareit 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
since all companies and analysts do not calculate ffo in a similar fashion  the company s calculation of ffo presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by other companies 
a reconciliation of ffo to net income allocable to common shareholders  the gaap measure the company believes to be the most directly comparable  is contained in item of this form k 
excludes properties under development and north magnolia avenue  a  square foot non core office building located in orlando  florida 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements of reckson associates realty corp 
the company and related notes thereto 
the company considers certain statements set forth herein to be forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  with respect to the company s expectations for future periods 
certain forward looking statements  including  without limitation  statements relating to the timing and success of acquisitions and the completion of development or redevelopment of properties  the financing of the ii 
back to contents company s operations  the ability to lease vacant space and the ability to renew or relet space under expiring leases  involve risks and uncertainties 
many of the forward looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as believes  may  expects  anticipates  intends or similar expressions 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions  the actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements and the company can give no assurance that its expectation will be achieved 
among those risks  trends and uncertainties are the general economic climate  including the conditions affecting industries in which our principal tenants compete  changes in the supply of and demand for office in the new york tri state area  changes in interest rate levels  changes in the company s credit ratings  changes in the company s cost and access to capital  downturns in rental rate levels in our markets and our ability to lease or re lease space in a timely manner at current or anticipated rental rate levels  the availability of financing to us or our tenants  financial condition of our tenants  changes in operating costs  including utility  security  real estate tax and insurance costs  repayment of debt owed to the company by third parties  risks associated with joint ventures  liability for uninsured losses or environmental matters  and other risks associated with the development and acquisition of properties  including risks that development may not be completed on schedule  that the tenants will not take occupancy or pay rent  or that development or operating costs may be greater than anticipated 
consequently  such forward looking statements should be regarded solely as reflections of the company s current operating and development plans and estimates 
these plans and estimates are subject to revisions from time to time as additional information becomes available  and actual results may differ from those indicated in the referenced statements 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements of the company include accounts of the company and all majority owned and controlled subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has utilized information available including its past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
it is possible that the ultimate outcome as anticipated by management in formulating its estimates inherent in these financial statements may not materialize 
however  application of the critical accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates  which may impact comparability of the company s results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable minimum rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis  which averages minimum rents over the terms of the leases 
the excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due are included in deferred rents receivable on the company s balance sheets 
contractually due but unpaid rents are included in tenant receivables on the company s balance sheets 
certain lease agreements also provide for reimbursement of real estate taxes  insurance  common area maintenance costs and indexed rental increases  which are recorded on an accrual basis 
ancillary and other property related income is recognized in the period earned 
the company makes estimates of the collectibility of its accounts receivables related to base rents  tenant escalations and reimbursements and other revenue or income 
the company specifically analyzes tenant receivables and analyzes historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition  when tenants are in bankruptcy  the company makes estimates of the expected recovery of pre petition administrative and damage claims 
in some cases  the ultimate resolution of those claims can exceed a year 
these estimates have a direct impact on the company s net income because a higher bad debt reserve results in less net income 
ii 
back to contents the company incurred approximately  million and million of bad debt expense  net of discontinued operations  for the years ended december   and  respectively  related to tenant receivables which accordingly reduced total revenues and reported net income during the period 
the company records interest income on investments in notes receivable on the accrual basis of accounting 
the company does not accrue interest on impaired loans where  in the judgment of management  collection of interest according to the contractual terms is considered doubtful 
among the factors the company considers in making an evaluation of the collectibility of interest are i the status of the loan  ii the value of the underlying collateral  iii the financial condition of the borrower and iv anticipated future events 
reckson construction development llc  the successor to reckson construction group  inc  and reckson construction group new york  inc 
use the percentage of completion method for recording amounts earned on their contracts 
this method records amounts earned as revenue in the proportion that actual costs incurred to date bear to the estimate of total costs at contract completion 
gain on sales of real estate are recorded when title is conveyed to the buyer  subject to the buyer s financial commitment being sufficient to provide economic substance to the sale and the company having no substantial continuing involvement with the buyer 
the company follows the guidance provided for under the financing accounting standards board fasb statement no 
accounting for sales of real estate statement no 
 which provides guidance on sales contracts that are accompanied by agreements which require the seller to develop the property in the future 
under statement no 
 profit is recognized and allocated to the sale of the land and the later development or construction work on the basis of estimated costs of each activity  the same rate of profit is attributed to each activity 
as a result  profits are recognized and reflected over the improvement period on the basis of costs incurred including land as a percentage of total costs estimated to be incurred 
the company uses the percentage of completion method  as future costs of development and profit are reliably estimated 
real estate land  buildings and improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost 
tenant improvements  which are included in buildings and improvements  are also stated at cost 
expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as they are incurred 
renovations and or replacements  which improve or extend the life of the asset  are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
depreciation is computed utilizing the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of ten to thirty years for buildings and improvements and five to ten years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
tenant improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the related leases 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income 
should the company lengthen the expected useful life of a particular asset  it would be depreciated over more years  and result in less depreciation expense and higher annual net income 
assessment by the company of certain other lease related costs must be made when the company has a reason to believe that the tenant will not be able to execute under the term of the lease as originally expected 
on july  and january   the company adopted fasb statement no  business combinations and fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  respectively 
as part of the acquisition of real estate assets  the fair value of the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building and building improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases  other value of in place leases  and value of tenant relationships  based in each case on their fair values 
the company allocates a portion of the purchase price to tangible assets including the fair value of the building and building improvements on an as if vacant basis and to land determined either by real estate tax ii 
back to contents assessments  independent appraisals or other relevant data 
additionally  the company assesses fair value of identified intangible assets and liabilities based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known trends  and market economic conditions that may affect the property 
if the company incorrectly estimates the values at acquisition or the undiscounted cash flows  initial allocation of purchase price and future impairment charges may be different 
long lived assets on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the real estate properties may be impaired 
a property s value is impaired only if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges to be generated by the property are less than the carrying value of the property 
such cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties and other investments 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income  because recognizing an impairment results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income 
in determining impairment  if any  the company has adopted fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
statement no 
did not have an impact on net income allocable to common shareholders 
statement no 
only impacts the presentation of the results of operations and gain on sales of real estate assets for those properties sold during the period within the consolidated statements of income 
in accordance with the provisions of statement no 
 and emerging issues task force eitf  the company allocated approximately million and million of its unsecured corporate interest expense to discontinued operations for the years ended december  and  respectively 
eitf states that interest on debt that is required to be repaid as a result of the disposal transaction should be allocated to discontinued operations 
pursuant to the terms of the company s unsecured credit facility the credit facility  the company was required to repay the credit facility to the extent of the net proceeds  as defined  received from the sales of unencumbered properties 
as such  the company has allocated to discontinued operations the interest expense incurred on the portion of its credit facility  which was required to be repaid 
in august  the company amended and extended its credit facility  whereby such repayment requirement was eliminated

r on july  effective january   the company elected to follow statement no 
and currently uses the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees and expects to continue to use this acceptable option valuation model upon the required adoption of statement no 
r ii 
back to contents on july  because statement no 
r must be applied not only to new awards but to previously granted awards that are not fully vested on the effective date  and because the company adopted statement no 
using the prospective transition method which applied only to awards granted  modified or settled after the adoption date  compensation cost for some previously granted awards that were not recognized under statement no 
would be recognized under statement no 
r 
however  on july   the date the company expects to adopt statement no 
r  all of the unexercised options outstanding at december   under its stock option plans will be fully vested 
as a result  no additional expense will be recognized 
in addition  had the company adopted statement no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure statement no 

statement no

variable interest entities in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which explains how to identify variable interest entities vies and how to assess whether to consolidate such entities 
vies are primarily entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without additional financial support from other parties or whose equity holders lack adequate decision making ability 
all vies with which the company is involved must be evaluated to determine the primary beneficiary of the risks and rewards of the vie 
the primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the vie for financial reporting purposes

back to contents liquidity and capital resources historically  rental revenue has been the principal source of funds to pay operating expenses  debt service and non incremental capital expenditures  excluding incremental capital expenditures of the company 
the company expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements generally through its net cash provided by operating activities along with its unsecured credit facility described below 
the credit facility contains several financial covenants with which the company must be in compliance in order to borrow funds thereunder 
during recent quarterly periods  the company has incurred significant leasing costs as a result of increased market demands from tenants and high levels of leasing transactions that result from the re tenanting of scheduled expirations or space vacated as a result of early terminations of leases 
the company is also expending costs on tenants that are renewing or extending their leases earlier than scheduled 
the company is currently experiencing high tenanting costs including tenant improvement costs  leasing commissions and free rent in all of its markets 
for the years ended december  and  the company paid or accrued approximately million and million  respectively  for tenanting costs including tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions 
as a result of these and or other operating factors  the company s cash flow from operating activities was not sufficient to pay of the dividends paid on its common stock 
to meet the short term funding requirements relating to these leasing costs  the company has used proceeds of property sales or borrowings under its credit facility 
based on the company s forecasted leasing  it anticipates that it will continue to incur similar shortfalls 
the company currently intends to fund any shortfalls with proceeds from non income producing asset sales or borrowings under its credit facility 
the company periodically reviews its dividend policy to determine the appropriateness of the company s dividend rate relative to the company s cash flows 
the company adjusts its dividend rate based on such factors as leasing activity  market conditions and forecasted increases and decreases in its cash flow as well as required distributions of taxable income to maintain reit status 
there can be no assurance that the company will maintain the current quarterly distribution level on its common stock 
the company expects to meet most of its financing requirements through long term unsecured borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities of the company 
in certain situations  primarily in joint venture transactions  the company used secured debt in connection with the acquisition of properties 
during the year ended december   the company issued approximately million of common stock and the operating partnership issued million of senior unsecured debt securities 
there can be no assurance that there will be adequate demand for the company s equity at the time or at the price in which the company desires to raise capital through the sale of additional equity 
similarly  there can be no assurance that the operating partnership will be able to access the unsecured debt markets at the time when the company desires to sell its unsecured notes 
in addition  when valuations for commercial real estate properties are high  the company will seek to sell certain land inventory to realize value and profit created 
the company will then seek opportunities to reinvest the capital realized from these dispositions back into value added assets in the company s core tri state area markets 
however  there can be no assurances that the company will be able to identify such opportunities that meet the company s underwriting criteria 
the company will refinance existing mortgage indebtedness  senior unsecured notes or indebtedness under its credit facility at maturity or retire such debt through the issuance of additional unsecured debt securities or additional equity securities 
the company anticipates that the current balance of cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operating activities  together with cash available from borrowings  equity offerings and proceeds from sales of land and non income producing assets  will be adequate to meet the capital and liquidity requirements of the company in both the short and long term 
the company s senior unsecured debt is currently rated bbb by fitch ratings  bbb by standard poor s and baa by moody s investors service 
the rating agencies review the ratings assigned to an issuer such as the company on an ongoing basis 
negative changes in the company s ratings may result in increases in the company s borrowing costs  including borrowings under its credit facility 
the company s markets are currently experiencing a recovery in the economic cycle 
as a result of current economic conditions  we have experienced higher renewal rates and a lower number of lease terminations 
our results reflect decreased vacancy rates in our markets and our asking rents in our markets have stabilized and in some instances trended higher and landlords are still required to grant concessions such as free rent and tenant improvements but at a lower rate than had been experienced in the prior year 
ii 
back to contents our markets continue to experience higher real estate taxes and utility rates 
the company believes that trends are moving positively from a landlord s perspective and that the above average tenant costs relating to leasing are decreasing 
this trend is supported by increased occupancy and reduced vacancy rates in all of our markets  by the general economic recovery in the market resulting in job growth and the limited new supply of office space 
the company carries comprehensive liability  fire  extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of its properties 
six of the company s properties are located in new york city 
as a result of the events of september   insurance companies were limiting coverage for acts of terrorism in all risk policies

the potential impact of terrorist attacks in the new york city and tri state area may adversely affect the value of the company s properties and its ability to generate cash flow 
as a result  there may be a decrease in demand for office space in metropolitan areas that are considered at risk for future terrorist attacks  and this decrease may reduce the company s revenues from property rentals 
in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  the company is required to make distributions to its stockholders of at least of reit taxable income

in november  donald j 
rechler tendered his resignation from the company s board of directors  including his position as non executive chairman  in order to pursue other interests 
also  in november  scott h 
rechler was appointed chairman of the board and the number of directors of the board was decreased from nine to eight 
the company s board currently consists of seven independents  of which four were elected during  and one insider 
mr 
peter quick serves as the lead independent director of the board 
in addition  each of the audit  compensation and nominating and governance committees is comprised solely of independent directors 
in may  the company revised its policy with respect to compensation of its independent directors to provide that a substantial portion of the independent director s compensation shall be in the form of common stock of the company 
such common stock may not be sold until such time as the director is no longer a member of the company s board 
recently  the company has taken certain additional actions to enhance its corporate governance policies 
these actions included opting out of the maryland business combination statute  de staggering the board of directors to provide that each director is subject to election by shareholders on an annual basis and modifying the company s five or fewer limitation on the ownership of its common stock so that such limitation may only be used to protect the company s reit status and not for anti takeover purposes 
the company has also adopted a policy which requires that each independent director acquire and hold at least  of common stock of the company excluding equity granted as board compensation and a policy which requires that at least one independent director be rotated off the board every three years 
a number of shareholder derivative actions have been commenced purportedly on behalf of the company against the board of directors relating to the disposition 
the complaints allege  among other things  that the process by which the directors agreed to the transaction was not sufficiently independent of the rechler family and did not involve a market check or third party auction process and  as a result  was not for adequate consideration 
the plaintiffs seek similar relief  including a declaration that the directors violated their fiduciary duties and damages 
on may   the circuit court for baltimore city granted the defendants motions to dismiss the three consolidated maryland actions on the ground that the plaintiffs in those actions had failed to make a pre suit demand on the board of directors  or to allege facts showing that such a demand would have been futile 
final judgment was entered on june   and on june   the plaintiffs in the maryland actions filed a notice of appeal from that judgment to the maryland court of special appeals 
the company s management believes that the complaints are without merit 
in july  as a result of certain provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of  the company discontinued the use of stock loans in its ltip 
in connection with ltip grants made prior to the enactment of ii 
back to contents the sarbanes oxley act of  the company made stock loans to certain executive and senior officers to purchase  shares of its common stock at market prices ranging from per share to per share 
the stock loans were set to bear interest at the mid term applicable federal rate and were secured by the shares purchased 
such stock loans including accrued interest were scheduled to vest and be ratably forgiven each year on the anniversary of the grant date based upon vesting periods ranging from four to ten years based on continued service and in part on attaining certain annual performance measures 
these stock loans had an initial aggregate weighted average vesting period of approximately nine years 
as of december   and giving effect to the settlement of the employment contracts of certain former executive officers  there remains  shares of common stock subject to the original stock loans which are anticipated to vest between and approximately million and million of compensation expense was recorded for the years ended december  and  respectively  related to these ltip grants 
such amounts have been included in marketing  general and administrative expenses on the company s consolidated statements of income 
the outstanding stock loan balances due from executive and senior officers aggregated approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively  and have been included as a reduction of additional paid in capital on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
other outstanding loans to executive and senior officers at december  and december  amounted to approximately million and million  respectively  and are included in investments in affiliate loans and joint ventures on the company s consolidated balance sheets and are primarily related to tax payment advances on stock compensation awards and life insurance contracts made to certain executive and non executive officers 
in november and march  an award of rights was granted to certain executive officers of the company the rights and rights  respectively and collectively  the rights 
each right represents the right to receive  upon vesting  one share of common stock if shares are then available for grant under one of the company s stock option plans or  if shares are not so available  an amount of cash equivalent to the value of such stock on the vesting date 
the rights will vest in four equal annual installments which began on november  and shall be fully vested on november  
the rights will be earned as of march  and will vest in three equal annual installments beginning on march  and shall be fully vested on march  
dividends on the shares will be held by the company until such shares become vested  and will be distributed thereafter to the applicable officer 
the rights also entitle the holder thereof to cash payments in respect of taxes payable by the holder resulting from the rights 
the rights aggregate  shares of the company s common stock and the rights aggregate  shares of common stock 
as of december   and giving effect to the settlement of the employment contracts of certain former executive officers  there remains  shares of common stock related to the rights and  shares of common stock related to the rights 
approximately  and  of compensation expense was recorded for the years ended december  and  respectively  related to the rights 
such amounts have been included in marketing  general and administrative expenses on the company s consolidated statements of income 
in march  the company established a new ltip for its executive and senior officers the ltip 
the four year plan has a core award  which provides for annual stock based compensation based upon continued service and in part based on attaining certain annual performance measures 
the plan also has a special outperformance component in the form of a bonus pool equal to of the total return in excess of a cumulative and compounded annual total return on the company s common equity for the period through the four year anniversary after the date of grant the special outperformance pool 
the aggregate amount payable to such officers from the special outperformance pool is capped at an amount calculated based upon a total cumulative and compounded annual return on the common equity of 
an officer s special outperformance award represents an allocation of the special outperformance pool and will become vested on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant  provided that the officer remains in continuous employment with the company or any of its affiliates until such date  and the company has achieved on a cumulative and compounded basis  during the four fiscal years completed on the applicable anniversary date  a total return to holders of the common equity that i is at or above the th percentile of the total return to stockholders achieved by members of the peer group during the same period and ii equals at least per ii 
back to contents annum 
special outperformance awards will be paid in cash  however  the compensation committee  in its sole discretion  may elect to pay such an award in shares of common stock  valued at the date of vesting  if shares are available at such time under any of the company s existing stock option plans 
the ltip provides that no dividends or dividend equivalent payments will accrue with respect to the special outperformance awards 
on march   the company made available  shares of its common stock under its existing stock option plans in connection with the core award of the ltip for certain of its executive and senior officers 
during may  the special outperformance awards of the ltip were amended to increase the per share base price above which the four year cumulative return is measured from to 
on march   the company met its annual performance measure with respect to the prior annual period 
as a result  the company issued to the participants  shares of its common stock related to the core component of the ltip 
the board of directors has approved an amendment to the ltip to revise the peer group used to measure relative performance 
the amendment eliminated the mixed office and industrial companies and added certain other pure office companies in order to revise the peer group to office sector companies 
the board has also approved the revision of the performance measurement dates for future vesting under the core component of the ltip from the anniversary of the date of grant to december st of each year 
this was done in order to have the performance measurement coincide with the performance period that the company believes many investors use to judge the performance of the company 
on december   the operating partnership entered into definitive agreements with certain executive and senior officers of the company to revise their incentive awards under the ltip 
the revised agreements provide for i the rescission of the unvested portion of their core awards and ii an award in exchange for the rescinded core awards of an equal number of units of a new class of limited partnership interests ltip units of the operating partnership 
each executive and senior officer participating in the ltip was offered the option to retain all or a portion of their core awards or to rescind them in exchange for new awards of ltip units 
effective december   certain executive and senior officers accepted such offer and thereby amended their amended and restated long term incentive award agreement to cancel  in the aggregate   shares of restricted stock of the company representing all or a portion of their unvested core award  and received an equal number of ltip units 
the revised awards under the ltip were designed to provide the potential for executives to retain a greater equity interest in the company by eliminating the need for executives to sell a portion of the core awards immediately upon vesting in order to satisfy personal income taxes which are due upon vesting under the original core awards 
the terms of each award of ltip units are substantially similar to those of the core awards 
the vesting  performance hurdles and timing for vesting remain unchanged 
however  an ltip unit represents an equity interest in the operating partnership  rather than the company 
at issuance  the ltip unit has no value but may over time accrete to a value equal to but never greater than the value of one share of common stock of the company a reit share 
initially  ltip units will not have full parity with op units with respect to liquidating distributions 
upon the occurrence of certain triggering events  the operating partnership will revalue its assets for the purpose of the capital accounts of its partners and any increase in valuation of the operating partnership s assets from the date of the issuance of the ltip units through the triggering event will be allocated to the capital accounts of holders of ltip units until their capital accounts are equivalent to the capital accounts of holders of op units 
if such equivalence is reached  ltip units would achieve full parity with op units for all purposes  and therefore accrete to an economic value equivalent to reit shares on a one for one basis 
after two years from the date of grant  if such parity is reached  vested ltip units may be redeemed for cash in an amount equal to the then fair market value of an equal number of reit shares or converted into an equal number of op units  as determined by the company s compensation committee 
however  there are circumstances under which such economic equivalence would not be reached 
until and unless such economic equivalence is reached  the value that the officers will realize for vested ltip units will be less than the value of an equal number of reit shares 
in addition  unlike core awards wherein dividends that accumulate during the ltip are paid upon vesting  ltip units will receive the same ii 
back to contents quarterly distributions as op units on a current basis  thus providing full dividend equivalence with reit shares 
at the scheduled march vesting date and assuming the specified performance hurdles are met  officers that received ltip units will receive a one time cash payment that will represent payment of the full amount vested of the accrued unpaid dividends under the core award through the issuance date of the ltip units 
in order to more closely replicate the terms of the core awards being rescinded  the company also entered into agreements with three executive officers  which provide that in the event of a change of control the executive shall receive the equivalent value of one reit share for each ltip unit 
as of december  and giving effect to the settlement of the employment contracts of certain former executive officers and the cancellation by certain executive and senior officers of all or part of their core award to ltip units  there remains  shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under the core award of the ltip 
with respect to the core award of the ltip  the company recorded approximately million and million of compensation expense for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
such amounts have been included in marketing  general and administrative expenses on the company s consolidated statements of income 
no provision has been made in either or with respect to the special outperformance pool of the ltip due to the uncertainty of the outcome of achieving the requisite performance measures 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements except for its non controlling interest in the jv and its joint venture interest in rsvp 
for a more detailed description of these arrangements see overview and background of this item inflation the office leases generally provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed escalations 
in addition  the office leases provide for separate escalations of real estate taxes  operating expenses and electric costs over a base amount 
the industrial r d leases generally provide for fixed base rent increases  direct pass through of certain operating expenses and separate real estate tax escalations over a base amount 
the company believes that inflationary increases in expenses will be mitigated by contractual rent increases and expense escalations described above 
as a result of the impact of the events of september   the company has realized increased insurance costs  particularly relating to property and terrorism insurance  and security costs 
the company has included these costs as part of its escalatable expenses and has billed them to its tenants consistent with the terms of the underlying leases and believes they are collectible 
to the extent the company s properties contain vacant space  the company will bear such inflationary increases in expenses 
the credit facility and the mezz note bear interest at variable rates  which will be influenced by changes in short term interest rates  and are sensitive to inflation 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as net income or loss  excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable properties plus real estate depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company presents ffo because it considers it an important supplemental measure of the company s operating performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits  many of which present ffo when reporting their results 
ffo is intended to exclude gaap historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets  which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes ratably over time 
historically  however  real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions 
as a result  ffo provides a performance measure that  when compared year over year  reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs  development activities  interest costs and other matters without the inclusion of depreciation and amortization  providing perspective that may not necessarily be apparent from net income 
the company computes ffo in accordance with the standards established by nareit 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not indicative of cash ii 
back to contents available to fund cash needs 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
since all companies and analysts do not calculate ffo in a similar fashion  the company s calculation of ffo presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by other companies 
ffo for the years ended december  and includes gain from the sales of land and a build to suit transaction in the amount of million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   pursuant to the company s adoption of fasb statement no 
 which addresses reporting for gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  the company has reduced previously reported ffo by approximately million related to the write off of certain deferred loan costs incurred in connection with the company s refinancing of its debt 
these costs were previously recorded as an extraordinary loss and therefore excluded from the company s calculation of ffo

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk facing the company is interest rate risk on its long term debt and notes receivable 
the company will  when advantageous  hedge its interest rate risk using financial instruments 
the company is not subject to foreign currency risk 
the company manages its exposure to interest rate risk on its variable rate indebtedness by borrowing on a short term basis under its credit facility until such time as it is able to retire the short term variable rate debt with either a long term fixed rate unsecured debt offering  equity offerings or through sales or partial sales of assets 
the company will recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges will be adjusted to fair value through income 
if a derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset  liability  or firm commitment through earnings  or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
on march   the company entered into two anticipatory interest rate hedge instruments which were scheduled to coincide with an august debt maturity  totaling million  to protect itself against potentially rising interest rates 
on august   the operating partnership issued million of senior unsecured notes due august  and simultaneously settled certain interest rate hedge instruments resulting in a net benefit to the company of approximately million 
such benefit is being amortized against interest expense over the term of the notes to effectively reduce interest expense 
the fair market value fmv of the company s long term debt and notes receivable is estimated based on discounting future cash flows at interest rates that management believes reflect the risks associated with long term debt and notes receivable of similar risk and duration
