item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview we operate a chain of shoprite supermarkets in central new jersey 
we believe it is important to maintain a modern  one stop competitive shopping environment for our customers and therefore have invested heavily in new  expanded and remodeled facilities 
we have incorporated upscale service departments in our world class supermarket concept 
we are the largest member of wakefern  the largest retailer owned food cooperative warehouse in the united states 
since we purchase from wakefern most of the product we sell  participate in advertising  supply  insurance and technology programs with wakefern  and receive of wakefern s patronage dividend  our success is integrally tied to the success of wakefern 
we operate in a highly competitive geographic area 
certain of our competitors are non union and therefore may have lower labor and related fringe benefit costs 
in the past five years a non union competitor  wegmans  has opened five stores in our trading area 
we expect wegmans to continue to open additional locations in our marketing area in the future 
additionally  another non union operator  wal mart  is expected to open super centers  which include extensive food operations  in our trading area 
certain categories of selling  general and administrative expenses have increased disproportionately in comparison to our sales growth and to inflation in the last three years 
we have experienced substantial increases in employee health and pension costs under union contracts and for non union associates 
additionally  the cost of utilities to operate our stores has increased dramatically in fiscal we expect these trends to continue for fiscal we look at a variety of indicators to evaluate our performance  such as same store sales  sales per store  sales per selling square foot  percentage of total sales by department  shrink by department and store  departmental gross profit margins  sales per man hour  hourly labor rates and percent of overtime 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results 
the application of those critical accounting policies requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
impairment of goodwill effective november   the company implemented statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangibles that have indefinite useful lives will not be amortized  but instead will be tested at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level 
the company has determined that it is contained within one reporting unit and as such  impairment is tested at the company level 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company completed the goodwill annual impairment test prescribed by sfas the company engaged an independent third party appraiser with expertise in valuations of the type contemplated to undertake the first step of foodarama s goodwill impairment test 
the carrying value of the company s equity was compared to the fair value of the company s equity as of november  the valuation date  the first day of the company s fiscal year ended october  the fair value was calculated using a weighted average from the results obtained from three widely accepted valuation approaches discounted cash flow analysis  comparable public company analysis  and comparable public transaction analysis 
the appraiser excluded the market capitalization of foodarama s publicly traded stock as an approach to determine fair value of equity because foodarama s stock is thinly traded 
the goodwill impairment test is comprised of several steps 
based on the results obtained from the first step of the goodwill impairment test  which resulted in the fair value exceeding the carrying value of equity  further analysis was not required  and foodarama s goodwill was determined not to be impaired 
no events or circumstances occurring subsequent to the valuation date have affected the valuation as of that date 
inventory valuation we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
cost was determined using the last in  first out lifo method for approximately and of inventories in fiscal years and  respectively 
under the lifo method  the cost assigned to items sold is based on the cost of the most recent items purchased 
as a result  the costs of the first items purchased remain in inventory and are used to value ending inventory 
the excess of estimated current costs over lifo carrying value  or lifo reserve  was approximately  and  at october  and november   respectively 
costs for the balance of inventories are determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
cost was determined using the retail method for approximately and of inventories in fiscal years and  respectively 
under the retail method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a cost to retail ratio for various groupings of similar items to the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the retail inventory method calculations are certain management judgments and estimates  including shrinkage  which could impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
cost was determined using the item cost method for approximately and of inventories in fiscal years and  respectively 
this method involves counting each item in inventory  assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances of each item and recording the actual cost of items sold 
the item cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the retail method of accounting 
we believe we have the appropriate inventory valuation controls in place to minimize the risk that inventory values would be materially misstated 
patronage dividends as a stockholder of wakefern  the company earns a share of wakefern s earnings  which is distributed as a patronage dividend 
this dividend is based on a distribution of wakefern s operating profits for its fiscal year  which ends the saturday closest to september  in proportion to the dollar volume of business transacted by each member of wakefern during that fiscal year 
patronage dividends are recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
the company accrues estimated patronage dividends due from wakefern quarterly  based on an estimate of the annual wakefern patronage dividend and an estimate of the company s share of this annual dividend based on the company s estimated proportional share of the dollar volume of business transacted with wakefern that year 
these estimates are based on both historical patronage dividend percentages and current volume merchandise purchased from wakefern 
a change in this estimate by 
would represent a change in annual gross profit dollars of approximately pension plans and other postretirement benefits we sponsor two defined benefit pension plans covering administrative personnel and members of a union 
the plans assets consist primarily of publicly traded stocks and fixed income securities 
additionally  the company will provide certain current officers and provided former officers with supplemental income payments and limited medical benefits during retirement 
the determination of the company s obligation and expense for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent  in part  on the company s selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts 
these assumptions are described in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of increase in compensation costs 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and recorded obligations in future periods 
while management believes that its assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in the company s assumptions may materially affect pension obligations and future expense 
to develop the expected long term rate of return on asset assumption  the company considered the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class  as well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio 
based on these factors and the asset allocation discussed below  the company elected to use an expected return on plan assets in determining pension expense for fiscal this is the same expected return on plan assets used in determining pension expense for fiscal the assumptions were net of expected plan expenses payable from the plans assets 
a 
reduction in our expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  holding all other factors constant  would have increased our pension expense during fiscal by approximately  the company s objective in selecting a discount rate is to select the best estimate of the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled on the measurement date 
in making this best estimate  the company looks at rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the benefits 
this process includes looking at the universe of bonds available on the measurement date with a quality rating of aa or better 
based on the company s review of market interest rates  the company lowered the discount rate that it used for determining future pension obligations to a range from to for fiscal compared to a range of to for fiscal pension and postretirement benefit expense is sensitive to the discount rate and other assumptions used 
a 
decrease in the discount rate assumption used would increase pension and postretirement benefit expense during fiscal by  and  respectively 
as of october   the pension and postretirement benefit plans had cumulative net actuarial losses due to the difference between expected and actual plan experience  and to changes in actuarial assumptions including the discount rate  of approximately million and million  respectively 
these unrecognized net actuarial losses  to the extent not offset by future actuarial gains  result in increases in our future pension and postretirement benefit expense depending on several factors  including whether such gains and losses  as recognized at each measurement date  exceed the corridor in which gains and losses are not amortized  in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
the value of our pension plan assets has increased from million at november  to million at october  the investment performance returns have slightly increased the funded status of our pension plans 
we believe that  based on our actuarial assumptions and due to the funded status of our pension plans  we will be required to make cash contributions of million to our pension plans for the fiscal year ending october  workers compensation insurance from june  to may  we maintained workers compensation insurance with various carriers on a retrospective basis 
we have established reserve amounts based upon our evaluation of the status of claims still open as of october  and loss development factors used by the insurance industry 
as of october   the worker s compensation reserve totaled approximately  such reserve amount is only an estimate and there can be no assurance that our eventual workers compensation obligations will not exceed the amount of the reserve 
however  we believe that any difference between the amount recorded for our estimated liability and the costs of settling the actual claims would not be material to the results of operations 
financial condition and liquidity the company is a party to a third amended and restated revolving credit and term loan agreement the credit agreement with four financial institutions 
the credit agreement serves as our primary funding source for working capital and capital expenditures 
the credit agreement is secured by substantially all of the company s assets and provided for a total commitment of up to  including a revolving credit facility the revolving note of up to  a term loan the term loan in the amount of  and a capital expenditures facility the capex facility of up to  the credit agreement expires december  as of october  the company owed  on the term loan and  under the capex facility 
as of april  the credit agreement was amended to allow the company to borrow under the revolving credit facility  on any tuesday or wednesday  up to  in excess of the availability under the borrowing base limitation of of eligible inventory as long as a like amount of cash and cash equivalents are on hand at store level or in transit to the company s banks 
this amount was reduced to  on june  and  on july  with the provision expiring on august  additionally  the amendment realigned the annual limits on adjusted indebtedness  indebtedness attributable to capitalized lease obligations  adjusted capex and store project capex to more closely follow the timing of the company s new store and store remodeling program 
the lending group also consented to the purchase of a store location from wakefern for as of august  the credit agreement was further amended to allow the company to borrow under the revolving credit facility  on any tuesday and on any wednesday  up to  in excess of the availability under the borrowing base limitation of of eligible inventory as long as a like amount of cash and cash equivalents are on hand at store level or in transit to the company s banks 
this provision expired on january  this amendment is superceded by the october  amendment discussed below 
as of october  the credit agreement was further amended to allow the company to borrow under the revolving credit facility up to  in excess of the availability under the borrowing base limitation of of eligible inventory as long as a like amount of cash and cash equivalents are on hand at store level or in transit to the company s banks 
additionally  the total revolving commitment was increased to  these provisions expired on january  as of july  the credit agreement was amended to increase the limit on the amount of adjusted capex for fiscal to  and decrease the limit on the amount of adjusted capex for fiscal to  the amendment realigned the annual limits on adjusted capex to more closely follow the timing of the company s store remodeling program 
for the year ended october   the value of the accrued benefits under the company s pension plans exceeded the aggregate fair value of the assets of the plans by   more than the amount permitted under the credit agreement 
this event of default was waived by our lenders 
the credit agreement contains a number of covenants with which the company must comply 
non compliance with any of such covenants could affect the availability of funds under the credit agreement and have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and liquidity 
the company is in compliance with the major financial covenants under the credit agreement as of october   as follows actual as defined in the financial covenant credit agreement credit agreement adjusted ebitda greater than   leverage ratio less than to to debt service coverage ratio greater than to to adjusted capex less than   store project capex less than   excludes obligations under capitalized leases  interest expense and depreciation expense attributable to capitalized leases  non cash write downs and changes in the lifo reserve 
the leverage ratio is calculated by dividing the current and non current portions of long term debt and long term debt related party by adjusted ebitda 
the debt service coverage ratio is calculated by dividing operating cash flow by the sum of adjusted net interest expense  which excludes interest on capitalized leases  the current provision for income taxes and regularly scheduled principal payments  which exclude principal payments on capitalized leases 
operating cash flow is calculated by subtracting amounts expended for property and equipment which are not used for projects in excess of   in fiscal from adjusted ebitda 
adjusted capex is all capital expenditures other than new replacement store project capex 
represents limitations on capital expenditures for fiscal represents capital expenditures for fiscal on january  we financed the purchase of  of equipment for the expanded store location in east brunswick  new jersey 
the note bears interest at and is payable in monthly installments over its five year term 
on october  we financed the purchase of  of equipment for the expanded store location in east brunswick  new jersey 
the note bears interest at and is payable in monthly installments over its five year term 
on january  we financed the purchase of  of equipment for the new store location in woodbridge  new jersey 
the note bears interest at and is payable in monthly installments over its seven year term 
during the fifty two weeks ended october   the company was required to make an additional investment in wakefern for two new stores  which includes the location purchased from wakefern  and an increased assessment for a replacement store 
on june  wakefern increased the amount that each shareholder is required to invest in wakefern s capital stock to a maximum of  for each store operated by such shareholder member 
previously  the maximum was  per store 
the above changes in the amounts of required investment increased our investment in wakefern by  which will be paid weekly  without interest  over a four year period starting september  over the next three years the company plans to open two replacement and three new stores and expand one existing location 
for fiscal years  and we have budgeted   and  respectively  for these projects  store remodelings and maintenance capital expenditures 
financing for these projects will be provided by cash flow from operations  the revolving note and additional financing outside of  and which is permitted under  the credit agreement 
any additional investment required by wakefern for new locations will be financed by wakefern 
no cash dividends have been paid on the common stock since  and we have no present intentions or ability to pay any dividends in the near future on our common stock 
the credit agreement does not permit the payment of any cash dividends on the company s common stock 
working capital at october  the company had working capital of  as compared to working capital of  on november  and a working capital deficiency of  on november  the company normally requires small amounts of working capital since inventory is generally sold at approximately the same time that payments to wakefern and other suppliers are due and most sales are for cash or cash equivalents 
working capital improved in fiscal primarily as the result of the increase in receivables from wakefern 
this increase relates primarily to receivables for patronage dividends and other current amounts due us 
when collected  the proceeds from these receivables will be used to reduce the revolving note which is classified as long term borrowings 
this will result in a corresponding decrease in working capital 
the balance of accounts receivables consist primarily of returned checks due the company  third party pharmacy insurance claims and organization charge accounts 
the terms of most receivables are days or less 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts is large in comparison to the amount of accounts receivable because the allowance consists primarily of a reserve for returned checks which are not written off until all collection efforts are exhausted and a reserve for payments receivable under an agreement for a formerly occupied location 
a legal action has commenced to recover the amounts due us under this agreement 
working capital improved in fiscal primarily as the result of the increase in receivables from wakefern

comparable store sales increased in fiscal and in fiscal sales from relocated and closed stores  as well as new stores opened  in the respective periods are not included in this calculation while sales from remodeled and expanded stores are included in this calculation 
comparable store sales increases in fiscal and fiscal were partially offset by decreased sales in certain of the company s stores affected by competitive store openings and the impact of several of our new and replacement locations
