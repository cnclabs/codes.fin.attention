item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
general we operate institutes in states  which were providing technology oriented postsecondary education to more than  students as of december  we derive our revenue almost entirely from tuition  tool kits  fees and charges paid by  or on behalf of  our students 
most students at our institutes pay a substantial portion of their tuition and other education related expenses with funds received under various government sponsored student financial aid programs  especially the federal student financial aid programs under title iv title iv programs of the higher education act of  as amended the hea 
in  we indirectly derived approximately of our revenue  determined on a cash accounting basis as defined by the us department of education s ed regulations  from title iv programs 
our revenue varies based on the aggregate student population  which is influenced by the following factors the number of students attending our institutes at the beginning of a fiscal period  the number of new first time students entering and former students re entering our institutes during a fiscal period  student retention rates  and general economic conditions 
new students generally enter our institutes at the beginning of an academic quarter that begins for most programs of study in early march  mid june  early september or late november 
our establishment of new institutes and the introduction of additional program offerings at our existing institutes have been significant factors in increasing the aggregate student population in recent years 
in order to participate in title iv programs  a new institute must be authorized by the state in which it will operate  accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by the ed  and certified by the ed to participate in title iv programs 
the accrediting commission that accredits our institutes grants accreditation to a new institute prior to its first class start date 
the ed s certification process cannot commence until the institute receives its state authorization and accreditation 
in the last two years  we have experienced minimal delay in obtaining ed certification of our new institutes and learning sites 
we earn tuition revenue on a weekly basis  pro rata over the length of each of four  week academic quarters in each fiscal year 
state regulations  accrediting commission criteria and our policies generally require us to refund a portion of the tuition and fee payments received from a student who withdraws from one of our institutes during an academic quarter 
our statement of income recognizes immediately the amount of tuition and fees  if any  that we may retain after payment of any refund 
prior to  if a student withdrew  the tuition revenue related to the remainder of that academic quarter and the fee revenue related to the remainder of the student s program were recorded and the amount of any refund resulting from the application of federal  state or accreditation requirements or our refund policy was recorded as an expense 
for the periods presented  we have reclassified tuition and fee revenue by netting the corresponding revenue and expense related to the remaining tuition and fees with any related refund recorded for students who withdrew 
as a result  revenue and cost of educational services have each been reduced by  for the year ended december  the reclassifications had no impact on our total consolidated results reported in any period presented 
we incur expenses throughout a fiscal period in connection with the operation of our institutes 
the cost of educational services includes faculty and administrative salaries  cost of course materials  occupancy costs  depreciation and amortization of equipment costs  facilities and leasehold improvements  and certain other administrative costs incurred by our institutes 
student services and administrative expenses include direct marketing costs which are marketing expenses directly related to new student recruitment  indirect marketing expenses  an allowance for doubtful accounts and administrative expenses incurred at our corporate headquarters 
direct marketing costs include salaries and employee benefits for recruiting representatives and direct solicitation expenses 
we capitalize our direct marketing costs excluding advertising expenses using the successful efforts method and amortize them on a cost pool by cost pool basis over the period that we expect to receive revenue streams associated with those assets 
we expense as incurred our marketing costs that do not relate to the direct solicitation of potential students 
in  we developed five new residence bachelor degree programs and one new online bachelor degree program 
we began offering one or more of these new bachelor degree programs at of our institutes in in addition  a total of of our institutes were approved to offer bachelor degree programs as of december  compared to as of december  in  we developed three new residence bachelor degree programs  three new residence associate degree programs  and one new online master degree program 
in addition  a total of of our institutes were approved to offer bachelor degree programs as of december  compared to as of december  we also expanded to several additional institutes in the use of our hybrid education delivery model  pursuant to which certain program courses are taught on campus and others are taught online over the internet the hybrid delivery model 
in  we developed two new residence bachelor degree programs  two new online bachelor degree programs  three new residence associate degree programs  and three new online associate degree programs 
in addition  a total of of our institutes were approved to offer bachelor degree programs as of december  compared to as of december  we also expanded the use of the hybrid delivery model to institutes in we opened four new institutes in  three new institutes in and two new institutes and one learning site in we also closed two institutes in we plan to open three or four new institutes and up to four learning sites in the remainder of our new institutes have historically incurred a loss during the month period after the first class start date 
critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses and contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from those estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
these policies should be read in conjunction with note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment 
we include all property and equipment in the financial statements at cost and make provisions for depreciation of property and equipment using the straight line method 
estimated useful lives generally range from three to ten years for our furniture and equipment  three to years for leasehold improvements  to years for the buildings and three to eight years for capitalized software 
changes in circumstances  such as changes in our curricula and technological advances  may result in the actual useful lives of our property  equipment and capitalized software differing from our estimates 
we regularly review and evaluate the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment and capitalized software 
although we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from our assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
recognition of revenue 
tuition revenue is recorded on a straight line basis over the length of the applicable course 
if a student withdraws from an institute  the standards of most state education authorities that regulate our institutes  the accrediting commission that accredits our institutes and our own internal policy limit a student s obligation for tuition and fees to the institute depending on when a student withdraws during an academic quarter refund policies 
the terms of the refund policies vary by state  and the limitations imposed by the refund policies are generally based on the portion of the academic quarter that has elapsed at the time the student withdraws 
the greater the portion of the academic quarter that has elapsed at the time the student withdraws  the greater the student s obligation is to the institute for the tuition and fees related to that academic quarter 
we record revenue net of any refunds paid as a result of any applicable refund policy 
on an individual student basis  tuition earned in excess of cash received is recorded as accounts receivable  and cash received in excess of tuition earned is recorded as deferred revenue 
the cost of textbooks is included in the tuition and is amortized on a straight line basis over the applicable course length and the deferral of textbook costs is recorded in prepaids and other current assets 
tool kit sales and the related cost of the tool kits are recognized at the beginning of each academic quarter 
academic fees which are charged only one time to students on their first day of class attendance and admission processing fees which  prior to their discontinuance in  were charged only one time to students upon being evaluated for admission to their programs of study are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the average program length of months 
deferred revenue is recorded for fees collected in excess of revenue recognized 
if a student withdraws from an institute  all unrecognized revenue relating to his or her fees  net of any refunds paid as a result of any applicable refund policy  is recognized upon the student s departure 
administrative fees  which are charged to students when they withdraw or graduate from their programs of study at an institute  are recognized when the students withdraw or graduate from their programs of study at the institute 
more than of our revenue represents tuition charges and less than of our revenue represents bookstore sales and student fees 
the amount of tuition earned depends on the cost per credit hour of the courses in the program  the number of courses in the program  how long a student remains enrolled in the program  how many program courses a student takes during each period of enrollment in the program  and the total number of students enrolled in each program 
each of these factors is known at the time our tuition revenue is calculated and is not subject to estimation 
direct marketing costs 
direct costs incurred relating to the enrollment of new students are capitalized using the successful efforts method 
direct marketing costs include salaries and employee benefits of recruiting representatives and other direct costs less admission processing fees  if any 
successful efforts is the ratio of students enrolled to prospective students interviewed 
the higher the rate of interviewed students who enroll  the greater the percentage of our direct marketing costs that are capitalized 
we amortize our direct marketing costs on a cost pool by cost pool basis over the period that we expect to receive revenue streams associated with those assets 
the direct costs subject to capitalization are readily quantifiable and are not subject to estimation 
the amortization method is based on historical trends of student enrollment and retention activity and is not subject to significant assumptions 
we regularly evaluate the future recoverability of these deferred costs 
contingent liabilities 
we are subject to litigation in the ordinary course of our business 
when we are aware of a claim or potential claim  we assess the likelihood of any loss or exposure 
if it is probable that a loss will result and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated  we record a liability for the loss 
the liability recorded includes probable and estimable legal costs associated with the claim or potential claim 
if the loss is not probable or the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated  we disclose the claim if the likelihood of a potential loss is reasonably possible and the amount involved is material 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  deviations from our estimates could produce a materially different result 
new accounting pronouncements in january and may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued two staff positions with respect to the application of statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  to the accounting and disclosure requirements associated with the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of drug act 
the drug act affects postretirement health care benefits that companies may provide to their employees 
we do not provide any postretirement health care benefits to our employees  and  therefore  those staff positions do not have an impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf provides further guidance on the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to debt and equity securities in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  and sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
in september  the fasb issued fasb staff position eitf  which delays the effective date until additional guidance is issued for the application of the recognition and measurement provisions of eitf to investments in securities that are impaired 
the disclosure requirements of eitf  however  are effective for annual periods ending after june  until further guidance is provided by the fasb  we are unable to determine the effect  if any  that eitf will have on our financial condition or results of operations 
see note for additional disclosures regarding our investments 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment that revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under this revised standard  all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  must be reflected in the financial statements using the fair value method with the related expenses recognized over the service period 
sfas no 
r will be effective for periods beginning after june  and allows for several alternative transition methods 
we expect to adopt sfas no 
r in our third fiscal quarter of on a modified prospective basis without restating prior interim periods  which will require that we recognize compensation expense for all stock option and other equity based awards that vest or become exercisable after the effective date 
we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas no 
r will have on our financial condition or results of operations 
variations in quarterly results of operations our quarterly results of operations have tended to fluctuate within a fiscal year due to the timing of student matriculations 
each of our four fiscal quarters have weeks of earned tuition revenue 
revenue in our third and fourth fiscal quarters generally benefits from increased student matriculations 
the number of new students entering our institutes tends to be substantially higher in june of all new students in and september of all new students in because of the significant number of recent high school graduates entering our institutes for the academic quarters beginning in those two months 
the academic schedule generally does not affect our incurrence of most of our costs  however  and costs do not fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
the following table sets forth our revenue in each fiscal quarter of   and quarterly revenue dollars in thousands three months ended amount percent amount percent amount percent march june september december total for year results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of certain statement of income data to revenue for the periods indicated 
year ended december  revenue cost of educational services student services and administrative expenses special legal and other investigation costs operating income interest income  net income before income taxes the following table sets forth our total student enrollment as of december   and as of december  total student enrollment increase over prior year the following table sets forth total new student enrollment during the years ended december   and for the year ended december  total new student enrollment increase over prior year we generally organize the academic schedule for programs of study offered at our institutes on the basis of four week academic quarters in a calendar year that typically begin in early march  mid june  early september and late november 
to measure the persistence of our students  the number of continuing students in any academic quarter is divided by the total student enrollment as of the end of the immediately preceding academic quarter 
a continuing student is any student who  in any academic quarter  is enrolled in a program of study at an itt technical institute and was enrolled in the same program at any itt technical institute at the end of the immediately preceding academic quarter 
total student enrollment includes all new and continuing students enrolled at our itt technical institutes at the end of an academic quarter 
the following table sets forth the rates of our students persistence for each quarter in   and for the three months ended  march june sept dec beginning in the second quarter of  we began using the hybrid delivery model with a larger number of our students  which increased the number of courses that we teach online over the internet to our students 
student retention is typically lower in courses taught online over the internet compared to courses taught on campus 
as a result of the expanded use of the hybrid delivery model  our student persistence rate decreased 
we believe that the student persistence rate will continue to decrease until we expect it to stabilize in the second quarter of year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue 
revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to a increase in tuition rates in march  a increase in the total student enrollment at december  compared to december   and a increase in new student enrollment at our institutes in the year ended december  compared to the same period in  which was primarily the result of the opening of new institutes  an increased number of institutes offering bachelor degree programs  an increased number of new programs of study offered by our institutes  an increased number of responses to our marketing and advertising  operational changes that increased the percentage of new student enrollments arising from those responses  the availability of private student loans to supplement federal student financial aid  and the use of the hybrid delivery model at more institutes 
this increase in revenue was partially offset by a decrease in our students persistence rate for the year ended december  cost of educational services 
cost of educational services increased million  or  to million in from million in the principal causes of this increase included the costs required to service the increased enrollment  normal inflationary cost increases for wages  rent and other costs of services  increased costs due to opening new institutes one opened in march  one opened in june  one opened in december  and two opened in december  and increased costs associated with implementing the hybrid delivery model at more institutes 
cost of educational services as a percentage of revenue decreased to in from in the primary causes of this decrease include continued facility and faculty utilization efficiencies  certain fixed costs at our institutes that did not increase proportionately with increases in our revenue resulting from increased student enrollment and tuition rate increases  new and renegotiated vendor contracts  and a net reduction of occupancy costs resulting from our purchase of six facilities in and one facility in that we had previously leased 
student services and administrative expenses 
student services and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in student services and administrative expenses decreased to of revenue in compared to of revenue in  primarily due to an increase in the amount of marketing costs deferred as a result of discontinuing the admission processing fee  partially offset by a increase in media advertising expenses and an increase in bad debt expense from of revenue in to of revenue in special legal and other investigation costs 
special legal and other investigation costs of million were accrued in the year ended december  for our estimated legal and other investigation costs associated with the doj investigation of us  the inquiry initiated by the sec into the allegations being investigated by the doj  and the securities class action  shareholder derivative and books and records inspection lawsuits filed against us  certain of our current and former executive officers and each of our directors collectively  the actions 
we incurred million of this accrual and million of other non legal investigation costs associated with the actions during the year ended december  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth elsewhere in this report 
operating income 
operating income increased million  or  to million in from million in the operating margin increased to of revenue in from in  primarily due to continued facility and faculty utilization efficiencies  new and renegotiated vendor contracts  a net reduction of occupancy costs resulting from our purchase of six facilities in and one facility in that replaced facilities which we previously leased  and certain fixed costs at our institutes that did not increase proportionately with increases in our revenue resulting from increased student enrollment and tuition rate increases 
the increase in operating margin was partially offset by the million accrual for special legal and other investigation costs associated with the actions 
income taxes 
our combined effective federal and state income tax rate in both and was 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue 
revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to a increase in tuition rates in march  a increase in the total student enrollment at december  compared to december   and a increase in total new student enrollment at our institutes in compared to  which is primarily a result of opening new institutes  an increased number of responses to our marketing and advertising  and operational changes that increased the percentage of new student enrollments arising from those responses 
cost of educational services 
cost of educational services increased million  or  to million in from million in the principal causes of this increase included the costs required to service the increased enrollment  normal inflationary cost increases for wages  rent and other costs of services  and increased costs due to opening new institutes one opened in june  three opened in september  one opened in march  one opened in june and one opened in december 
cost of educational services as a percentage of revenue decreased to in from in the primary causes of this decrease include continued facility and faculty utilization efficiencies  certain fixed costs at our institutes that did not increase proportionately with increases in our revenue resulting from increased student enrollment  new and renegotiated vendor contracts  a net reduction of occupancy costs resulting from our purchase of facilities that replaced facilities which we had previously leased six were purchased during the three months ended september  and six were purchased during the year ended december   and changes in indiana tax law that caused the classification of certain indiana taxes to be changed from cost of educational services to income taxes 
student services and administrative expenses 
student services and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in student services and administrative expenses decreased to of revenue in compared to of revenue in  primarily due to a increase in media advertising expenses offset by a reduction in bad debt expense from of revenue for to of revenue for operating income

income taxes 
our combined effective federal and state income tax rate in was compared to in  primarily due to changes in indiana and other state tax laws 
liquidity and capital resources in  we indirectly derived approximately of our revenue  determined on a cash accounting basis as defined by the ed s regulations  from title iv programs 
federal regulations dictate the timing of disbursements of funds under title iv programs 
students must apply for a new loan for each academic year  which consists of three academic quarters 
loan funds are generally provided by lenders in three disbursements for each academic year 
the first disbursement is usually received either days after in the case of students commencing a program of study or ten days before the start of the first academic quarter of a student s academic year  and the second and third disbursements are typically received ten days before the start of each subsequent quarter of a student s academic year 
while the timing of loan disbursements to us is subject to a student s directions to the lender and to existing regulatory requirements regarding such disbursements  we have typically received student loan funds upon the lender s disbursement of the student loan funds 
on may   we declared a two for one split of our common stock  effected on june  by payment of a stock dividend to all shareholders of record at the close of business on may  of one share on each one share of our common stock issued and outstanding or held as treasury stock on may  stock split 
our earnings per share amounts and the number of shares in all prior periods have been restated to reflect the stock split 
on january   our board of directors approved an amendment to our restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock from million to million amendment 
if the amendment is approved by our shareholders at our annual meeting of shareholders  it will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of amendment with the delaware secretary of state 
our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions in accordance with rule b of the exchange act 
the following table sets forth the repurchase of outstanding shares of our common stock during  and year ended december  number of shares repurchased total cost of shares repurchased in millions average cost per share all of the repurchased shares of our common stock became treasury shares upon repurchase and most of the repurchased shares continue to be held as treasury shares 
as of december   our existing repurchase authorization permits us to repurchase an additional  shares of our common stock 
we may elect to repurchase additional shares of our common stock from time to time in the future  depending on market conditions and other considerations 
the purpose of the stock repurchase program is to help us achieve our long term goal of enhancing shareholder value 
our principal uses of cash are to pay salaries  occupancy and equipment costs  recruiting and marketing expenses  administrative expenses and taxes  including institute start up costs for new institutes 
we have generated positive cash flows from operations for the past five years 
cash flows from operations in were million  a decrease of million from million in this decrease was primarily a result of a large initial increase in cash flows from operations realized in following the implementation of new cash management strategies  and amounts paid in connection with the actions 
as of december   we had million of investments that we plan to hold until maturity 
the maturity dates extend beyond one year for million of those held to maturity investments 
as of december   we had million of investments in auction rate debt securities  variable rate demand notes and auction rate preferred equity securities that were available for sale 
although the contractual maturity dates for some of our auction rate debt securities and variable rate demand notes extend beyond ten years  we have the ability to quickly liquidate those investments and we do not intend to hold those investments until they mature 
cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  and investments ranged from a low of million in february to a high of million in november our investments in marketable debt securities with remaining contractual maturity dates of days or less are recorded in cash and cash equivalents at cost  which approximates fair market value 
we have investments in marketable debt and auction rate preferred equity securities  which are classified as trading  available for sale or held to maturity  depending on our investment intentions with regard to those securities 
marketable debt securities classified as trading or available for sale securities that have remaining contractual maturity dates in excess of days at the time of purchase are recorded at their market value 
marketable debt securities classified as held to maturity securities are recorded at their amortized cost  because we have the intent and ability to hold those investments until they mature 
auction rate preferred equity securities classified as available for sale securities are recorded at their market value 
investments that we intend to hold for more than one year are recorded as non current investments 
our investments included auction rate debt securities  variable rate demand notes and auction rate preferred equity securities that were classified as available for sale securities and recorded in short term investments and investments on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and despite the long term nature of the contractual maturities of our auction rate debt securities and variable rate demand notes  we have the ability to quickly liquidate those investments 
we also had no material gross unrealized holding or realized gains losses from our investments in auction rate debt securities and variable rate demand notes for the years ending december   and all income generated from those investments was recorded as interest income 
previously  some of our investments in auction rate debt securities and variable rate demand notes were recorded in cash and cash equivalents instead of short term investments  based on their interest reset dates rather than their remaining contractual maturity dates 
in addition  we had classified some of our investments in auction rate debt securities  variable rate demand notes and auction rate preferred equity securities as held to maturity securities 
in connection with the preparation of this report  we reassessed the classification and recording of our investments in auction rate debt securities  variable rate demand notes and auction rate preferred equity securities  and we determined that it was appropriate to reclassify as available for sale securities all of our auction rate debt securities  variable rate demand notes and auction rate preferred equity securities  record on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and all of our investments in auction rate debt securities and variable rate demand notes with remaining contractual maturities of days or less in cash and cash equivalents  and greater than days in either short term investments or investments  based on our intent and ability to hold those auction rate debt securities and variable rate demand notes  and record all of our investments in auction rate preferred equity securities in short term investments on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and the reclassifications had no impact on our total current assets  cash flows provided by used for operating activities  cash flows provided by used for financing activities or total consolidated results reported in any period presented 
on december   we had positive working capital of million 
deferred revenue  which represents the cash received from students in excess of tuition earned  increased million to million on december  from million on december  this increase was primarily due to the students use of supplemental private loans and increased tuition revenue resulting from higher tuition rates and increased enrollment 
during  we recorded a million minimum pension liability adjustment with respect to our obligations under the esi pension plan and a corresponding million reduction in shareholders equity  which is net of a million deferred tax asset 
during  we reduced our minimum pension liability by million as a result of obtaining an investment return on plan assets in excess of our original estimates  and we recorded a corresponding million increase in shareholders equity  which is net of a million deferred tax asset 
during  we increased our minimum pension liability by million as a result of obtaining an investment return on plan assets less than our original estimate  a decrease in our discount rate  and refinements made to our future expected benefit payment assumptions 
we also recorded a corresponding million reduction in shareholders equity  which was net of a million deferred tax asset 
under the hea  an institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all title iv programs  if the rates at which the institution s students default on their federal student loans exceed specified percentages 
an institution whose ffel fdl cohort default rate is a or greater for three consecutive federal fiscal years loses eligibility to participate in the ffel  fdl and pell programs for the remainder of the federal fiscal year in which the ed determines that the institution has lost its eligibility and for the two subsequent federal fiscal years  or b greater than for one federal fiscal year loses eligibility to participate in the ffel and fdl programs for the remainder of the federal fiscal year in which the ed determines that the institution has lost its eligibility and for the two subsequent federal fiscal years 
if one of the campus groups lost its eligibility to participate in title iv programs and we could not arrange for alternative financing sources on similar terms for the students and their parents attending an institute in that campus group  the students ability to finance their education would be adversely affected  our receivables would increase and the number of students attending that campus group would probably decrease  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our campus groups ffel fdl cohort default rates ranged from to in the federal fiscal year  to in the federal fiscal year  and to in the federal fiscal year  the most recent year for which the ed has published ffel fdl official cohort rates 
if an institution s ffel fdl cohort default rate is or greater in any of the three most recent federal fiscal years  or if its cohort default rate for loans under the perkins program exceeds for any federal award year  the ed may place that institution on provisional certification status 
the ed may withdraw an institution s provisional certification without advance notice  if the ed determines that the institution is not fulfilling all material requirements 
the ed may also more closely review an institution that is provisionally certified  if it applies for approval to open a new location or makes some other significant change affecting its eligibility 
provisional certification does not otherwise limit an institution s access to title iv program funds 
provisional certification of our institutes has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  and we do not believe that it will in the future 
the standards of most of the state education authorities that regulate our institutes and the accrediting council for independent colleges and schools that accredits our institutes limit how much of a student s tuition and fees an institution can retain for a student who withdraws from the institution 
the hea and its implementing regulations impose limits on the amount of title iv program funds withdrawing students can use to pay their education costs return policy 
the return policy permits a student to use only a pro rata portion of the title iv program funds that the student would otherwise be eligible to use  if the student withdraws during the first of any period of enrollment 
the institution must return to the appropriate lenders or the ed any title iv program funds that the institution receives on behalf of a withdrawing student in excess of the amount the student can use for such period of enrollment 
depending on when a student withdraws during an academic quarter  the return policy can reduce the amount of title iv program funds that the withdrawing student can use to pay his or her education costs owed to the itt technical institute 
in these instances  withdrawing students may be unable to pay all of their education costs that would have been paid by the title iv program funds that were returned and we may be unable to collect a significant portion of those costs 
our students use of supplemental private loans has improved our collection of the students education costs 
under a provision of the hea commonly referred to as the rule  a for profit institution  such as each of our campus groups  becomes ineligible to participate in title iv programs if  on a cash accounting basis  the institution derives more than of its applicable revenue for a fiscal year from title iv programs 
for our fiscal year  the range of our campus groups was from approximately to approximately 
in  we purchased the facilities of five of our institutes and our corporate headquarters for a total of million 
in  we purchased a facility for one of our institutes for million 
we previously leased these facilities under operating lease agreements 
in addition  we purchased four parcels of land in for million on which we have commenced construction of facilities 
during  we spent million on the construction of facilities for four of our institutes 
we have agreed to construct four facilities and purchase two existing facilities for our institutes at a cost of million  all of which is expected to be incurred in we may purchase or build additional facilities for our institutes in our capital assets  other than our facilities discussed above  consist primarily of classroom and laboratory equipment such as computers  electronic equipment and robotic systems  classroom and office furniture  software and leasehold improvements 
capital expenditures  excluding facility and land purchases and facility construction  totaled million in and million during to date  cash generated from operations has been sufficient to meet our capital expenditures 
we plan to continue to upgrade and expand current facilities and equipment 
we expect that capital expenditures  excluding facility and land purchases and facility construction  will be approximately to million 
the capital additions are approximately million for a new institute and million for a new learning site 
we anticipate that our planned capital additions can be funded from cash flows from operations 
cash flows on a long term basis are highly dependent upon the receipt of title iv program funds and the amount of funds spent on new institutes  new learning sites  curricula additions at existing institutes and possible acquisitions 
we do not believe that any reduction in cash and cash equivalents or investments that may result from their use to effect any future stock repurchases  facility purchases or construction of facilities will have a material adverse effect on our expansion plans  planned capital expenditures  ability to meet any applicable regulatory financial responsibility standards  or ability to conduct normal operations 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth the specified contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years dollars in thousands operating lease obligations purchase obligations a total a represents the cost to purchase one facility that was consummated in january it does not include agreements to purchase one existing facility for a cost of  or to continue constructing buildings for four other facilities at a total cost not to exceed  these agreements do not constitute purchase obligations as defined by sfas no 
 disclosure of long term obligations 
we expect to incur these costs in off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we leased our non owned facilities under operating lease agreements 
a majority of the operating leases contain renewal options that can be exercised after the initial lease term 
renewal options are generally for periods of one to five years 
all operating leases will expire over the next years and management expects that those leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases in the normal course of business  we may purchase the facilities represented by those leases  or we may purchase or build other replacement facilities 
there are no material restrictions imposed by the lease agreements  and we have not entered into any significant guarantees related to the leases 
we are required to make additional payments under the operating lease terms for taxes  insurance and other operating expenses incurred during the operating lease period 
as part of our normal course of operations  one of our insurers issues surety bonds for us that are required by various education authorities that regulate us 
we are obligated to reimburse our insurer for any of those surety bonds that are paid by the insurer 
as of december   the total face amount of those surety bonds was million 
we have also provided a million irrevocable standby letter of credit to our insurer to secure our obligations under those surety bonds 
the letter of credit is collateralized by our investments 
in addition  we have provided a million irrevocable letter of credit to our workers compensation insurance providers to secure payment of our workers compensation claims 
from through  we entered into agreements with unaffiliated  private funding sources to provide supplemental loans to students to help pay the students cost of education that federal and state financial aid sources did not cover

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investments in marketable debt securities with remaining contractual maturity dates of days or less are recorded in cash and cash equivalents at cost  which approximates market value 
we have investments in marketable debt and auction rate preferred equity securities  which are classified as trading  available for sale or held to maturity  depending on our investment intentions with regard to those securities 
marketable debt securities classified as trading or available for sale securities that have remaining contractual maturity dates in excess of days at the time of purchase are recorded at their market value 
marketable debt securities classified as held to maturity securities are recorded at their amortized cost  because we have the intent and ability to hold those investments until they mature 
auction rate preferred equity securities classified as available for sale securities are recorded at their market value 
investments that we intend to hold for more than one year are recorded as non current investments 
we estimate that the market risk associated with our investments in marketable debt and auction rate preferred equity securities can best be measured by a potential decrease in the fair value of these securities resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates 
if such a hypothetical increase in rates were to occur  the reduction in the market value of our portfolio of marketable debt and auction rate preferred equity securities would not be material
