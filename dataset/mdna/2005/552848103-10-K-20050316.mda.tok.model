item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview business and general environment the company  through its subsidiary mortgage guaranty insurance corporation mgic  is the leading provider of private mortgage insurance in the united states to the home mortgage lending industry 
the company s principal products are primary mortgage insurance and pool mortgage insurance 
primary mortgage insurance may be written through the flow market channel  in which loans are insured in individual  loan by loan transactions 
primary mortgage insurance may also be written through the bulk market channel  in which portfolios of loans  are individually insured in single  bulk transactions 
the company s results of operations are affected by premiums written and earned premiums written and earned in a year are influenced by new insurance written  which increases the size of the in force book of insurance 
new insurance written is the aggregate principal amount of the mortgages that are insured during a period and is referred to as niw 
niw is affected by many factors  including the volume of low down payment home mortgage originations and competition to provide credit enhancement on those mortgages  including competition from other mortgage insurers and alternatives to mortgage insurance  such as loans 
cancellations  which reduce the size of the in force book of insurance that generates premiums 
cancellations due to refinancings are affected by the level of current mortgage interest rates compared to the mortgage coupon rates throughout the in force book 
premium rates  which are affected by the risk characteristics of the loans insured and the percentage of coverage on the loans 
premiums ceded to reinsurance subsidiaries of certain mortgage lenders and risk sharing arrangements with the gses 
premiums are generated by the insurance that is in force during all or a portion of the period 
hence  lower average insurance in force in one period compared to another is a factor that will reduce premiums written and earned  although this effect may be mitigated or enhanced by differences in the average premium rate between the two periods as well as by premium that is ceded 
also  niw and cancellations during a period will generally have a greater effect on premiums written and earned in subsequent periods than in the period in which these events occur 
investment income the investment portfolio is comprised almost entirely of highly rated  fixed income 
table of contents securities 
the principal factors that influence investment income are the size of the portfolio and its yield 
losses incurred losses incurred are the expense that results from a payment delinquency on an insured loan 
as explained under critical accounting policies below  this expense is recognized only when a loan is delinquent 
losses incurred are generally affected by the state of the economy  which affects the likelihood that loans will become delinquent and whether loans that are delinquent cure their delinquency 
the product mix of the in force book  with loans having higher risk characteristics generally resulting in higher delinquencies and claims 
the average claim payment  which is affected by the size of loans insured higher average loan amounts tend to increase losses incurred  the percentage coverage on insured loans deeper average coverage tends to increase incurred losses  and housing values  which affect the company s ability to mitigate its losses through sales of properties with delinquent mortgages 
the distribution of claims over the life of a book 
historically  the first years after a loan is originated are a period of relatively low claims  with claims increasing substantially for several years after that and then declining  although persistency and the condition of the economy can affect this pattern 
underwriting and other expenses 
the operating expenses of the company generally vary primarily due to contract underwriting volume  which in turn generally varies with the level of mortgage origination activity 
contract underwriting generates fee income included in other revenue 
the company s results of operations are also affected by income from joint ventures 
joint venture income principally consists of the aggregate results of the company s investment in two less than majority owned joint ventures  c bass and sherman 
c bass c bass is primarily an investor in the credit risk of credit sensitive single family residential mortgages 
it finances these activities through borrowings included on its balance sheet and by securitization activities generally conducted through off balance sheet entities 
c bass generally retains the first loss and other subordinate securities created in the securitization 
the loans owned by c bass and underlying c bass s mortgage securities investments are serviced by litton loan servicing  a subsidiary of c bass 
litton s servicing operations primarily support c bass s investment in credit risk  and investments made by funds managed or co managed by c bass  rather than generating fees for servicing loans owned by third parties 
c bass s consolidated results of operations are affected by net interest income 
table of contents net interest income is principally a function of the size of c bass s portfolio of whole loans and mortgage and other securities  and the spread between the interest income generated by these assets and the interest expense of funding them 
interest income from a particular security is recognized based on the expected yield for the security 
gain on sale and liquidation gain on sale and liquidation results from sales of mortgage and other securities  and liquidation of mortgage loans 
securities may be sold in the normal course of business or because of the exercise of call rights by third parties 
mortgage loan liquidations result from loan payoffs  from foreclosure or from sales of real estate acquired through foreclosure 
servicing revenue servicing revenue is a function of the unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans serviced and servicing fees and charges 
the unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans serviced by litton is affected by mortgages acquired by c bass because servicing on subprime and other mortgages acquired is generally transferred to litton 
litton also services or special services loans in mortgage securities owned by funds managed or co managed by c bass 
litton also may obtain servicing on loans in third party mortgage securities acquired by c bass or when the loans become delinquent by a specified number of payments known as special servicing 
gain on securitization gain on securitization is a function of the face amount of the collateral in the securitization and the margin realized in the securitization 
this margin depends on the difference between the proceeds realized in the securitization and the purchase price paid by c bass for the collateral 
the proceeds realized in a securitization include the value of securities created in the securitization that are retained by c bass 
revenues from money management activities these revenues include management fees from c bass issued collateralized bond obligations cbos  equity in earnings from c bass investments in investment funds managed or co managed by c bass and management fees and incentive income from investment funds managed or co managed by c bass 
hedging gains and losses  net of mark to market and whole loan reserve changes hedging gains and losses primarily consist of changes in the value of derivative instruments including interest rate swaps  interest rate caps and futures and short positions  as well as realized gains and losses from the closing of hedging positions 
c bass uses derivative instruments and short sales in a strategy to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on the value of its mortgage loans and securities 
changes in value of derivative instruments are subject to current recognition because c bass does not account for the derivatives as hedges under fas 
table of contents mortgage and other securities are classified by c bass as trading securities and are carried at fair value  as estimated by c bass 
changes in fair value between period ends a mark to market are reflected in c bass s statement of operations as unrealized gains or losses 
changes in fair value of mortgage and other securities may relate to changes in credit spreads or to changes in the level of interest rates or the slope of the yield curve 
mortgage loans are not marked to market and are carried at the lower of cost or fair value on a portfolio basis  as estimated by c bass 
during a period in which short term interest rates decline  in general  c bass s hedging positions will decline in value and the change in value  to the extent that the hedges related to whole loans  will be reflected in c bass s earnings for the period as an unrealized loss 
the related increase  if any  in the value of mortgage loans will not be reflected in earnings but  absent any countervailing factors  when mortgage loans owned during the period are securitized  the proceeds realized in the securitization should increase to reflect the increased value of the collateral 
sherman sherman is principally engaged in the business of purchasing and collecting for its own account delinquent consumer assets which are primarily unsecured 
the borrowings used to finance these activities are included in sherman s balance sheet 
sherman s consolidated results of operations are affected by revenues from receivable portfolios these revenues are the cash collections on such portfolios  and depend on the aggregate amount of receivables owned by sherman  the type of receivable and the length of time that the receivable has been owned by sherman 
amortization of receivables portfolios amortization is the recovery of the cost to purchase the receivable portfolios 
amortization expense is a function of estimated collections from the portfolios over their estimated lives 
if estimated collections cannot be reasonably predicated  cost is fully recovered before any net revenue the difference between revenues from a receivable portfolio and that portfolio s amortization is recognized 
costs of collection  which include servicing fees paid to third parties to collect receivables 

table of contents results the company s results of operations in were principally affected by losses incurred in  compared to  losses incurred decreased primarily due to a decrease in the delinquency inventory compared to the prior period increase 
this decrease in delinquency inventory was in part offset by increases in the estimates regarding how many delinquencies will eventually result in a claim and how much will be paid on claims 
premiums written and earned during  the company s written and earned premiums were lower than in due to a decline in the average insurance in force  as well as a decrease in niw through the flow and bulk channels 
investment income during  investment income was higher than in due to an increase in the average investment portfolio 
underwriting and other expenses underwriting and other expenses decreased in  compared to  primarily as a result of decreases in expenses related to contract underwriting activity 
income from joint ventures income from joint ventures increased in  compared to  due to higher income from each of sherman and c bass which was driven by growth in their respective assets 

table of contents results of operations as discussed under risk factors below  actual results may differ materially from the results contemplated by forward looking statements 
the company is not undertaking any obligation to update any forward looking statements it may make in the following discussion or elsewhere in this document 
niw the amount of mgic s niw this term is defined in the overview business and general environment section during the years ended december   and was as follows year ended december  billions flow niw bulk niw total niw refinance volume as a of primary flow niw the decrease in niw on a flow basis in was primarily the result of a decrease in refinance volume 
refinance volume in turn is driven by changes in interest rates as discussed with respect to cancellations below 
for a discussion of niw written through the bulk channel  see bulk transactions below 
the company expects niw in to approximate niw in the increase in niw on a flow basis in  compared to  was related to the increase in refinance volume from to 
table of contents cancellations and insurance in force niw and cancellations of primary insurance in force during the three years ended december   and  and the direct primary insurance in force at the end of each of those years was as follows year ended december  billions niw cancellations change in primary insurance in force as of december  direct primary insurance in force cancellation activity has historically been affected by the level of mortgage interest rates and the level of home price appreciation 
cancellations generally move inversely to the change in the direction of interest rates  although they generally lag a change in direction 
mgic s persistency rate percentage of insurance remaining in force from one year prior of at december  increased from at december  and at december  the company expects modest improvement in the persistency rate in  although this expectation assumes the absence of significant declines in the level of mortgage interest rates from their level in late february cancellation activity increased in  compared to  principally due to the lower interest rate environment 
bulk transactions the company s writings of bulk insurance are in part sensitive to the volume of securitization transactions involving non conforming loans 
the company s writings of bulk insurance are also sensitive to competition from other methods of providing credit enhancement in a securitization  including an execution in which the subordinate tranches in the securitization rather than mortgage insurance bear the first loss from mortgage defaults 
competition from such an execution in turn depends on  among other factors  the yield at which investors are willing to purchase tranches of the securitization that involve a higher degree of credit risk compared to the yield for tranches involving the lowest credit risk the difference in such yields is referred to as the spread and the amount of credit for losses that a rating agency will give to mortgage insurance  which may be affected by the agency s view of the outlook for the insurer s claims paying ability 
as the spread narrows  competition from an execution in which the subordinate tranches bear the first loss increases 
the competitiveness of the mortgage insurance execution in the bulk channel may also be impacted by changes in the company s view of the risk of the 
table of contents business  which is affected by the historical performance of previously insured pools and the company s expectations for regional and local real estate values 
as a result of the sensitivities discussed above  bulk volume can vary materially from period to period 
the spread referred to above was narrower in compared to and  along with continued competition from other mortgage insurers  adversely affected the competitiveness of the mortgage insurance execution during the year 
the competitiveness of the company s bulk offering was enhanced beginning in the third quarter of by  among other things  changes in mgic s expectations for losses on certain types of loans to reflect better than expected historical performance of such loan types 
as it has in past years  the company priced the bulk business written in to generate acceptable returns  there can be no assurance  however  that the assumptions underlying the premium rates will achieve this objective 
niw during for bulk transactions was higher than niw during primarily due to the more favorable spread referred to above 
pool insurance in addition to providing primary insurance coverage  the company also insures pools of mortgage loans 
new pool risk written during the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the company s direct pool risk in force was billion  billion and billion at december   and  respectively 
these risk amounts are contractual aggregate loss limits and for contracts without such limits  risk is calculated at the estimated amount that would credit enhance the loans in the pool to a aa level based on a rating agency model 
at december   and  there was billion  billion and billion  respectively  of risk without such limits for which risk in force was calculated on this basis at million  million and million  respectively 
during the years ended december   and  new risk written calculated on this basis was million  million and million  respectively 
net premiums written and earned net premiums written and earned during decreased  compared to  due to a decline in the average insurance in force  as well as a decrease in new insurance written through the flow and bulk channels 
the company expects the average insurance in force during to be lower than during as a result  the company anticipates that net premiums written and earned in will decline compared to net premiums written and earned increased in compared to primarily as a result of a higher percentage of premiums on products with higher premium rates  principally on insurance written through the bulk channel 

table of contents risk sharing arrangements through the nine months ended september   approximately of the company s new insurance written on a flow basis was subject to captive reinsurance arrangements with subsidiaries of certain mortgage lenders or risk sharing arrangements with the gses collectively  risk sharing arrangements compared to for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  new insurance written through the bulk channel is not subject to risk sharing arrangements 
the percentage of new insurance written during a period covered by risk sharing arrangements normally increases after the end of the period because  among other reasons  the transfer of a loan in the secondary market can result in a mortgage insured during a period becoming part of a risk sharing arrangement in a subsequent period 
therefore  the percentage of new insurance written covered by risk sharing arrangements is not shown for the current quarter 
premiums ceded in risk sharing arrangements are reported in the period in which they are ceded regardless of when the mortgage was insured 
during the three years ended december   and  mgic ceded million  million and million of written premium in captive reinsurance arrangements 
investment income investment income for increased due to an increase in the amortized cost of average invested assets to billion for from billion for the portfolio s average pre tax investment yield was at december  and the portfolio s average after tax investment yield was at december  and the company s net realized gains in and resulted primarily from the sale of fixed maturities 
as discussed in note new accounting standards to the company s consolidated financial statements  the impact of the final issuance of proposed fsp eitf a cannot be determined at this time 
under the proposed guidance  it may be more likely that a decrease in the market value of certain investments in the company s fixed income portfolio will be required to be recognized as a realized loss in the statement of operations than under the existing accounting standard 
investment income in decreased compared to due to a decrease in the average investment yield  offset by an increase in the amortized cost of average invested assets to billion for from billion for at december   the portfolio s average pre tax investment yield was and the portfolio s after tax investment yield was 
the company s net realized gains in resulted primarily from the sale of fixed maturities 
other revenue the decrease in other revenue in  compared to  is primarily the result of decreased revenue from contract underwriting due to a lower level of mortgage origination activity during compared to the increase in other revenue in  compared to  is primarily the result of increased revenue from contract underwriting 
losses as discussed in critical accounting policies below  consistent with industry practice  loss reserves for future claims are established only for loans that are currently delinquent 
the terms 
table of contents delinquent and default are used interchangeably by the company and are defined as an insured loan with a mortgage payment that is days or more past due 
loss reserves are established by management s estimating the number of loans in the company s inventory of delinquent loans that will not cure their delinquency historically  a substantial majority of delinquent loans have cured  which is referred to as the claim rate  and further estimating the amount that the company will pay in claims on the loans that do not cure  which is referred to as claim severity 
estimation of losses that the company will pay in the future is inherently judgmental 
the conditions that affect the claim rate and claim severity include the current and future state of the domestic economy and the current and future strength of local housing markets 
in  net losses incurred were million  of which million pertained to current year loss development and million pertained to prior years loss development 
in  net losses incurred were million  of which million pertained to current year loss development and million pertained to prior years loss development 
the amount of losses incurred pertaining to current year loss development represents the estimated amount to be ultimately paid on default notices received in the current year 
losses incurred pertaining to the current year increased in  compared to  primarily due to increases in the estimates regarding how many primary default notices will eventually result in a claim and how much will be paid on claims 
these increases in estimates relate to current trends in the default inventory such as an increase in defaults in the midwest  which experienced higher claim rates and claim severity in  as well as an increase in defaults on the book of business which has higher loan exposures with expected higher average claim payments 
these increases in estimates were partially offset by a decrease in the total number of default notices compared to the prior period increase in notices 
the amount of losses incurred pertaining to prior year loss development represents actual claim payments that were higher or lower than what was estimated by the company at the end of the prior year as well as a re estimation of amounts to be ultimately paid on defaults remaining in inventory from the end of the prior year 
this re estimation is the result of management s review of current trends in default inventory  such as defaults that have resulted in a claim  the amount of the claim  the change in relative level of defaults by geography and the change in average loan exposure 
in  the million reduction in losses incurred pertaining to prior years was due primarily to more stable loss trends experienced during the year 
in  there were significant increases in the rate at which the defaults went to claim claim rate and significant increases in individual claim amounts severity 
management believes these increases were attributable to such factors as an increase in defaults with higher risk characteristics  higher average loan amounts and deeper coverages 
as a result of these trends  there was a million increase  in  in losses incurred pertaining to prior years 
subject to the level of delinquencies in  the company expects that incurred losses during full year will approximate the level of losses incurred increased in compared to this increase was principally the result of a higher number of defaults both bulk and flow and increases in the estimates regarding how many defaults will eventually result in a claim and how much will be paid on claims 
information about the composition of the primary insurance default inventory at december   and appears in the table below 

table of contents total loans delinquent percentage of loans delinquent default rate flow loans delinquent percentage of flow loans delinquent default rate bulk loans delinquent percentage of bulk loans delinquent default rate a minus and subprime credit loans delinquent percentage of a minus and subprime credit loans delinquent default rate a portion of a minus and subprime credit loans is included in flow loans delinquent and the remainder is included in bulk loans delinquent 
most a minus and subprime credit loans are written through the bulk channel 
a minus loans have fico credit scores of  as reported to mgic at the time a commitment to insure is issued  and subprime loans have fico credit scores of less than the average primary claim paid for was  compared to  in and  in the pool notice inventory decreased from  at december  to  at december   the pool notice inventory was  at december  information about net losses paid in  and appears in the table below 
year ended december  net paid claims in millions flow bulk pool and other as of december   of the company s primary insurance in force was written subsequent to december  on the company s flow business  the highest claim frequency years have typically been the third through fifth year after the year of loan origination 
however  the pattern of claims frequency can be affected by many factors  including low persistency which can have the effect of accelerating the period in the life of a book during which the highest claim frequency occurs and deteriorating economic conditions which can result in increasing claims following a period of declining claims 
the company expects the period of 
table of contents highest claims frequency on bulk loans will occur earlier than in the historical pattern on the company s flow business 
underwriting and other expenses the decrease in underwriting and other expenses in is primarily attributable to decreases in expenses related to contract underwriting activity when compared to the increase in underwriting and other expenses in  compared to  was primarily attributable to increases in expenses related to insurance and contract underwriting activity 
consolidated ratios the table below presents the company s consolidated loss  expense and combined ratios for the periods indicated 
year ended december  consolidated insurance operations loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio the loss ratio expressed as a percentage is the ratio of the sum of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses to net premiums earned 
the expense ratio expressed as a percentage is the ratio of underwriting expenses to net premiums written 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
income taxes the effective tax rate was in  compared to in and in during those periods  the effective tax rate was below the statutory rate of  reflecting the benefits recognized from tax preferenced investments 
tax preferenced investments of the company include tax exempt municipal bonds  interests in mortgage related securities with flow through characteristics and investments in real estate ventures which generate low income housing credits 
the higher effective tax rate in compared to was principally due to less benefits being recognized from these investments 
the lower effective tax rate in  compared to  principally resulted from a higher percentage of total income before tax being generated from tax preferenced investments 
joint ventures the company s equity in the earnings from the c bass and sherman joint ventures with radian group inc and certain other joint ventures and investments  accounted for in accordance with the equity method of accounting  is shown separately  net of tax  on the company s consolidated statement of operations 
the increase in income from joint ventures in  compared to  as well as the increase in  compared to  is primarily the result of 
table of contents increased equity earnings from each of sherman and c bass 
c bass c bass is a mortgage investment and servicing firm specializing in credit sensitive single family residential mortgage assets and residential mortgage backed securities 
c bass principally invests in whole loans including subprime loans and mezzanine and subordinated residential mortgage backed securities backed by non conforming residential mortgage loans 
c bass s principal sources of revenues during the last three years were net interest income including accretion on mortgage securities  servicing fees  money management fees from c bass cbos and investment funds sponsored by c bass  and gains on securitization and liquidation of mortgage related assets  offset by hedging losses 
c bass s quarterly results of operations may be affected by the timing of its securitization transactions 
virtually all of c bass s assets do not have readily ascertainable market values and  as a result  their value for financial statement purposes is estimated by the management of c bass based on  among other things  valuations provided by financing counterparties 
the ultimate value of these assets is the net present value of their future cash flows  which depends on  among other things  the level of losses on the mortgages or underlying collateral and prepayment activity by the mortgage borrowers or other persons obligated on the collateral 
fair value adjustments could impact c bass s results of operations and the company s share of those results 
in addition  there can be no assurance that c bass s portfolio of mortgage loans and mortgage and other securities could be sold for their carrying values in c bass s balance sheet  particularly if substantial portions of the portfolio were being sold 
summary c bass balance sheets and income statements at the dates and for the periods indicated appear below 
summary balance sheets december  in millions total assets total liabilities debt owners equity most of which is scheduled to mature in one year or less 
included in total assets and total liabilities at december  and are approximately million and million  respectively of assets and the same amount of liabilities from securitizations that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment 
the liabilities from these securitizations are not included in debt in the table above 

table of contents summary income statements year ended december  in millions revenues expenses income before tax company s share of pretax income the increased contribution from c bass in compared to was primarily due to an increase in gains on sales and liquidation to third parties of securities and mortgage loans  higher net interest income  higher mark to market from calls by c bass of cbo securitizations and lower hedging losses 
gains on sale and liquidation to third parties increased principally due to calls of securities at par which had a book value below par 
higher net interest income was principally the result of a higher average portfolio of mortgage loans 
higher mark to market and lower hedging losses were reflective of changes in interest rates 
the increased contribution from c bass in compared to was principally attributable to a higher average portfolio of mortgage loans 
the company s investment in c bass on an equity basis at december  was million 
the company received million in distributions from c bass during versus million during the company does not anticipate that c bass s income before tax in will exceed its income before tax in however  the first quarter of is expected to be stronger than the first quarter of  assuming there is no significant decline in the level of short term interest rates during march sherman sherman is principally engaged in the business of purchasing and servicing delinquent consumer assets such as charged off credit card loans and chapter bankruptcy debt 
a substantial portion of sherman s consolidated assets are investments in consumer receivable portfolios that do not have readily ascertainable market values 
sherman s results of operations are sensitive to estimates by sherman s management of ultimate collections on these portfolios 
effective january   the company sold four percentage points of its interest in sherman to sherman s management for cash  reducing the company s interest in sherman to 
summary sherman balance sheets and income statements at the dates and for the periods indicated appear below 

table of contents summary balance sheets december  in millions total assets total liabilities debt members equity in mid january  sherman distributed million to its owners  reducing members equity on a pro forma basis for this distribution to million 
the company s investment in sherman on an equity basis at december  was million and on a pro forma basis for this distribution is million 
the company received million in distributions from sherman during compared to million during in march  sherman acquired the holding company for first national bank of marin for a payment of cash and subordinated notes 
this acquisition materially increased sherman s consolidated assets as well as its debt and financial leverage 
in  the bank was the rd largest credit card issuer in the united states  as measured by the amount of receivables generated 
the bank s operations following the acquisition will consist of originating subprime credit cards 
summary income statements year ended december  in millions revenues  net of amortization expenses income before tax company s share of pretax income 
table of contents the increased contribution from sherman during compared to and during compared to was primarily due to increased net revenue from receivable portfolios owned during the comparison periods attributable to continuing collections and lower amortization on those portfolios  and from higher collections due to growth in the amount of receivable portfolios owned by sherman in sequential periods 
the company does not anticipate that sherman s income before tax in will exceed its income before tax in however  the first quarter of is expected to be materially stronger than the first quarter of other matters under the office of federal housing enterprise oversight s ofheo risk based capital stress test for the gses  claim payments made by a private mortgage insurer on gse loans are reduced below the amount provided by the mortgage insurance policy to reflect the risk that the insurer will fail to pay 
claim payments from an insurer whose claims paying ability rating is aaa are subject to a reduction over the year period of the stress test  while claim payments from a aa rated insurer  such as mgic  are subject to an reduction 
the effect of the differentiation among insurers is to require the gses to have additional capital for coverage on loans provided by a private mortgage insurer whose claims paying rating is less than aaa 
as a result  there is an incentive for the gses to use private mortgage insurance provided by a aaa rated insurer 
financial condition the company had million  senior notes due in october and million  senior notes due in outstanding at december  and the company intends to refinance the million of senior notes through the issuance of senior debt 
in march  the company obtained a bank commitment for a credit facility of million expiring on the earlier of days after the closing of the facility or the repayment of the senior notes 
the company intends to draw upon this facility to refinance these senior notes if they cannot otherwise be refinanced 
at december  and  the market value of the company s outstanding debt was million and million  respectively 
see results of operations joint ventures above for information about the financial condition of c bass and sherman 
as of december   of the investment portfolio was invested in tax preferenced securities 
in addition  based on book value  the company s fixed income securities were approximately invested in a rated and above  readily marketable securities  concentrated in maturities of less than years 
at december   the company s derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio were immaterial 
the company places its investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in the company s investment policy guidelines  the policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument 
at december   the effective duration of the company s fixed income investment portfolio was years 
this means that for an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of basis points there would be an approximate change in the market value of the company s fixed income portfolio 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the company s consolidated sources of funds consist primarily of premiums written and investment income 
positive cash flows are invested pending future payments of claims and other expenses 
management believes that future cash inflows from premiums will be sufficient to meet future claim payments 
cash flow shortfalls  if any  could be funded through sales of short term investments and other investment portfolio securities subject to insurance regulatory requirements regarding the payment of dividends to the extent funds were required by other than the seller 
substantially all of the investment portfolio securities are held by the company s insurance subsidiaries 
the company has a million commercial paper program  which is rated a by standard poor s rating services and p by moody s investors service 
at december  and  the company had million and million in commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of and  respectively 
the company had a million credit facility available at december  expiring in may under the terms of the credit facility  the company must maintain shareholders equity of at least billion and mgic must maintain a risk to capital ratio of not more than and policyholders position which includes mgic s statutory surplus and its contingency reserve of not less than the amount required by wisconsin insurance regulation 
at december   the company met these requirements 
the facility is currently being used as a liquidity back up facility for the outstanding commercial paper 
the remaining credit available under the facility after reduction for the amount necessary to support the commercial paper was million and million at december  and  respectively 

table of contents in may  a swap designated as a cash flow hedge was amended to coincide with the credit facility 
under the terms of the swap contract  the company pays a fixed rate of and receives an interest rate based on libor 
the swap has an expiration date coinciding with the maturity of the credit facility and is designated as a cash flow hedge 
the cash flow swap outstanding at december  and is evaluated quarterly using regression analysis with any ineffectiveness being recorded as an expense 
to date this evaluation has not resulted in any hedge ineffectiveness 
swaps are subject to credit risk to the extent the counterparty would be unable to discharge its obligations under the swap agreements 
expense on the interest rate swaps during  and of approximately million  million and million  respectively  was included in interest expense 
gains or losses arising from the amendment or termination of previously held interest rate swaps are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the life of the hedged items 
the commercial paper  back up credit facility and the senior notes are obligations of the company and not of its subsidiaries 
the company is a holding company and the payment of dividends from its insurance subsidiaries is restricted by insurance regulation 
mgic is the principal source of dividend paying capacity 
in  mgic can pay up to million in dividends without the approval of the office of the commissioner of insurance of the state of wisconsin 
during  the company repurchased million shares of common stock under publicly announced programs at a cost of million 
at december   the company had authority covering the purchase of an additional million shares under these programs 
from mid through december   the company has repurchased million shares under publicly announced programs at a cost of billion 
funds for the shares repurchased by the company since mid have been provided through a combination of debt  including the senior notes and the commercial paper  and internally generated funds 
the company s principal exposure to loss is its obligation to pay claims under mgic s mortgage guaranty insurance policies 
at december   mgic s direct before any reinsurance primary and pool risk in force which is the unpaid or original principal balance of insured loans as reflected in the company s records multiplied by the coverage percentage  and taking account of any loss limit was approximately billion 
in addition  as part of its contract underwriting activities  the company is responsible for the quality of its underwriting decisions in accordance with the terms of the contract underwriting agreements with customers 
through december   the cost of remedies provided by the company to customers for failing to meet the standards of the contracts has not been material 
however  the decreasing trend of home mortgage interest rates over the last several years may have mitigated the effect of some of these costs since the general effect of lower interest rates can be to increase the value of certain loans on which remedies are provided 
there can be no assurance that contract underwriting remedies will not be material in the future 
the company s consolidated risk to capital ratio was at december  compared to at december  the decrease was due to an increase in capital and a decrease in risk in force during the risk to capital ratios set forth above have been computed on a statutory basis 
however  the methodology used by the rating agencies to assign claims paying ability ratings permits less 
table of contents leverage than under statutory requirements 
as a result  the amount of capital required under statutory regulations may be lower than the capital required for rating agency purposes 
in addition to capital adequacy  the rating agencies consider other factors in determining a mortgage insurer s claims paying rating  including its historical and projected operating performance  business outlook  competitive position  management and corporate strategy 
for certain material risks of the company s business  see risk factors below 
contractual obligations at december   the approximate future payments under the contractual obligations of the company of the type described in the table below are as follows payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations in millions total year years years years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total the company s long term debt obligations consist of million  senior notes due in october and million  senior notes due in  as discussed in note  short and long term debt to the company s consolidated financial statements and under liquidity and capital resources above 
the company s operating lease obligations include operating leases on certain office space  data processing equipment and autos  as discussed in note  leases to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s purchase obligations include obligations to purchase computer software  home office furniture and equipment 
the company s other long term liabilities represent the loss reserves established to recognize the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses related to defaults on insured mortgage loans 
the establishment of loss reserves is subject to inherent uncertainty and requires significant judgment by management 
the future loss payment periods are estimated based on historical experience 
critical accounting policies the company believes that the accounting policies described below involved significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
loss reserves reserves are established for reported insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses based on when notices of default on insured mortgage loans are received 
a default is defined as an 
table of contents insured loan with a mortgage payment that is days or more past due 
reserves are also established for estimated losses incurred on notices of default not yet reported 
consistent with industry practices  the company does not establish loss reserves for future claims on insured loans which are not currently in default 
reserves are established by management using estimated claims rates and claims amounts in estimating the ultimate loss 
the estimated claims rates and claims amounts represent what management believes best reflect the estimate of what will actually be paid on the loans in default 
these estimates are based on management s review of trends in the default inventory  such as defaults that have resulted in a claim  the amount of the claim  the change in the level of defaults by geography and the change in average loan exposure 
amounts for salvage recoverable are considered in the determination of the reserve estimates 
the establishment of loss reserves is subject to inherent uncertainty and requires significant judgment by management 
adjustments to reserve estimates are reflected in the financial statements in the years in which the adjustments are made 
the liability for reinsurance assumed is based on information provided by the ceding companies 
the incurred but not reported ibnr reserves referred to above result from defaults occurring prior to the close of an accounting period  but which have not been reported to the company 
consistent with reserves for reported defaults  ibnr reserves are established using estimated claims rates and claims amounts for the estimated number of defaults not reported 
as of december  and  the company has established ibnr reserves in the amount of million and million  respectively 
reserves also provide for the estimated costs of settling claims  including legal and other expenses and general expenses of administering the claims settlement process 
revenue recognition when the policy term ends  the primary mortgage insurance written by the company is renewable at the insured s option through continued payment of the premium in accordance with the schedule established at the inception of the policy term 
the company has no ability to reunderwrite or reprice these policies after issuance 
premiums written under policies having single and annual premium payments are initially deferred as unearned premium reserve and earned over the policy term 
premiums written on policies covering more than one year are amortized over the policy life in accordance with the expiration of risk which is the anticipated claim payment pattern based on historical experience 
premiums written on annual policies are earned on a monthly pro rata basis 
premiums written on monthly policies are earned as the monthly coverage is provided 
when a policy is cancelled  all premium that is non refundable is immediately earned 
any refundable premium is returned to the lender and will have no effect on earned premium 
policy cancellations also lower the persistency rate which is a variable used in calculating the rate of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs discussed below 
fee income of the non insurance subsidiaries is earned and recognized as the services are provided and the customer is obligated to pay 
deferred insurance policy acquisition costs costs associated with the acquisition of mortgage insurance policies  consisting of employee compensation and other policy issuance and underwriting expenses  are initially deferred and 
table of contents reported as deferred insurance policy acquisition costs dac 
dac arising from each book of business is charged against revenue in the same proportion that the underwriting profit for the period of the charge bears to the total underwriting profit over the life of the policies 
the underwriting profit and the life of the policies are estimated and are reviewed quarterly and updated when necessary to reflect actual experience and any changes to key variables such as persistency or loss development 
interest is accrued on the unamortized balance of dac 
risk factors the company s revenues and losses could be affected by the risk factors discussed below that are applicable to the company  and the company s income from joint ventures could be affected by the risk factors discussed below that are applicable to c bass and sherman 
these risk factors are an integral part of management s discussion and analysis 
these risk factors may also cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by forward looking statements that the company may make 
forward looking statements consist of statements which relate to matters other than historical fact 
among others  statements that include words such as the company believes  anticipates or expects  or words of similar import  are forward looking statements 
the company is not undertaking any obligation to update any forward looking statements it may make 
the amount of insurance the company writes could be adversely affected if lenders and investors select alternatives to private mortgage insurance 
these alternatives to private mortgage insurance include lenders structuring mortgage originations to avoid private mortgage insurance  such as a first mortgage with an loan to value ratio and a second mortgage with a  or loan to value ratio referred to as  or loans  respectively rather than a first mortgage with a  or loan to value ratio  investors holding mortgages in portfolio and self insuring  investors using credit enhancements other than private mortgage insurance or using other credit enhancements in conjunction with reduced levels of private mortgage insurance coverage  and lenders using government mortgage insurance programs  including those of the federal housing administration and the veterans administration 
while no data is publicly available  the company believes that loans and related products are a significant percentage of mortgage originations in which borrowers make down payments of less than and that their use  which the company believes is primarily by borrowers with higher credit scores  continues to increase 
during the fourth quarter of  the company introduced on a national basis a program designed to recapture business lost to these mortgage insurance avoidance products but there can be no assurance that it will be successful 
deterioration in the domestic economy or changes in the mix of business may result in more homeowners defaulting and the company s losses increasing 

table of contents losses result from events that reduce a borrower s ability to continue to make mortgage payments  such as unemployment  and whether the home of a borrower who defaults on his mortgage can be sold for an amount that will cover unpaid principal and interest and the expenses of the sale 
favorable economic conditions generally reduce the likelihood that borrowers will lack sufficient income to pay their mortgages and also favorably affect the value of homes  thereby reducing and in some cases even eliminating a loss from a mortgage default 
a deterioration in economic conditions generally increases the likelihood that borrowers will not have sufficient income to pay their mortgages and can also adversely affect housing values 
the mix of business the company writes also affects the likelihood of losses occurring 
in recent years  the percentage of the company s volume written on a flow basis that includes segments the company views as having a higher probability of claim has continued to increase 
these segments include loans with ltv ratios over including loans with ltv ratios  fico credit scores below  limited underwriting  including limited borrower documentation  or total debt to income ratios of or higher  as well as loans having combinations of higher risk factors 
approximately of the company s risk in force written through the flow channel  and more than half of the company s risk in force written through the bulk channel  consists of arms 
the company believes that during a prolonged period of rising interest rates  claims on arms would be substantially higher than for fixed rate loans  although the performance of arms has not been tested in such an environment 
in addition  the company believes the volume of interest only loans has recently increased 
because interest only loans are a relatively recent development  the company has no data on their historical performance 
the company believes claim rates on certain interest only loans will be substantially higher than on comparable loans requiring amortization 
interest only loans may also be arms 
the performance of the servicing function on a mortgage loan  particularly a subprime loan  can affect the likelihood that the loan will default as well as the loss resulting from a default 
the company believes select portfolio servicing select f k a fairbanks capital corp 
is the servicer of approximately of the loans insured by the company and approximately of the loans insured by the company written through the bulk channel a substantial number of which are subprime 
in  the servicer ratings assigned to select by moody s and s p were downgraded to below average due in part to concerns expressed by those rating agencies about select s regulatory compliance and operational controls 
in the second quarter of  these rating agencies raised select s service ratings to average 
competition or changes in the company s relationships with its customers could reduce the company s revenues or increase its losses 
competition for private mortgage insurance premiums occurs not only among private mortgage insurers but also with mortgage lenders through reinsurance transactions 
in these transactions  a lender s affiliate reinsures a portion of the insurance written by a private mortgage insurer on mortgages originated or serviced by the lender 
the level of competition within the private mortgage insurance industry has also increased as many large mortgage lenders have reduced the number of private mortgage insurers with whom they do business 
at the same time  consolidation among mortgage lenders has increased the share of the mortgage lending market held by large lenders 

table of contents our private mortgage insurance competitors include pmi mortgage insurance company ge capital mortgage insurance corporation united guaranty residential insurance company radian guaranty inc republic mortgage insurance company triad guaranty insurance corporation cmg mortgage insurance company assured guaranty limited f k a agc holdings limited  a financial guaranty company whose mortgage insurance business is primarily reinsurance  has announced that it intends to write investment grade mortgage guaranty insurance on a direct basis 
if interest rates decline  house prices appreciate or mortgage insurance cancellation requirements change  the length of time that the company s policies remain in force could decline and result in declines in company s revenue 
in each year  most of the company s premiums are from insurance that has been written in prior years 
as a result  the length of time insurance remains in force which is also generally referred to as persistency is an important determinant of revenues 
the factors affecting the length of time the company s insurance remains in force include the level of current mortgage interest rates compared to the mortgage coupon rates on the insurance in force  which affects the vulnerability of the insurance in force to refinancings  and mortgage insurance cancellation policies of mortgage investors along with the rate of home price appreciation experienced by the homes underlying the mortgages in the insurance in force 
during the s  the company s year end persistency ranged from a high of at december  to a low of at december  at december  persistency was at  compared to the record low of at september  over the past several years  refinancing has become easier to accomplish and less costly for many consumers 
hence  even in an interest rate environment favorable to persistency improvement  the company does not expect persistency will approach its december  level 
if the volume of low down payment home mortgage originations declines  the amount of insurance that the company writes could decline which would reduce the company s revenues 
the factors that affect the volume of low down payment mortgage originations include the level of home mortgage interest rates  the health of the domestic economy as well as conditions in regional and local economies  
table of contents housing affordability  population trends  including the rate of household formation  the rate of home price appreciation  which in times of heavy refinancing can affect whether refinance loans have loan to value ratios that require private mortgage insurance  and government housing policy encouraging loans to first time homebuyers 
in general  the majority of the underwriting profit premium revenue minus losses that a book of mortgage insurance generates occurs in the early years of the book  with the largest portion of the underwriting profit realized in the first year 
subsequent years of a book generally result in modest underwriting profit or underwriting losses 
this pattern of results occurs because relatively few of the claims that a book will ultimately experience occur in the first few years of the book  when premium revenue is highest  while subsequent years are affected by declining premium revenues  as persistency decreases due to loan prepayments  and higher losses 
if all other things were equal  a decline in new insurance written in a year that followed a number of years of higher volume could result in a lower contribution to the mortgage insurer s overall results 
this effect may occur because the older books will be experiencing declines in revenue and increases in losses with a lower amount of underwriting profit on the new book available to offset these results 
whether such a lower contribution would in fact occur depends in part on the extent of the volume decline 
even with a substantial decline in volume  there may be offsetting factors that could increase the contribution in the current year 
these offsetting factors include higher persistency and a mix of business with higher average premiums  which could have the effect of increasing revenues  and improvements in the economy  which could have the effect of reducing losses 
in addition  the effect on the insurer s overall results from such a lower contribution may be offset by decreases in the mortgage insurer s expenses that are unrelated to claim or default activity  including those related to lower volume 
changes in the business practices of fannie mae and freddie mac could reduce the company s revenues or increase its losses 
the business practices of fannie mae and freddie mac affect the entire relationship between them and mortgage insurers and include the level of private mortgage insurance coverage  subject to the limitations of fannie mae and freddie mac s charters  when private mortgage insurance is used as the required credit enhancement on low down payment mortgages  whether fannie mae or freddie mac influence the mortgage lender s selection of the mortgage insurer providing coverage and  if so  any transactions that are related to that selection  whether fannie mae or freddie mac will give mortgage lenders an incentive  such as a reduced guaranty fee  to select a mortgage insurer that has a aaa claims paying ability 
table of contents rating to benefit from the lower capital requirements for fannie mae and freddie mac when a mortgage is insured by a company with that rating  the underwriting standards that determine what loans are eligible for purchase by fannie mae or freddie mac  which thereby affect the quality of the risk insured by the mortgage insurer and the availability of mortgage loans  the terms on which mortgage insurance coverage can be canceled before reaching the cancellation thresholds established by law  and the circumstances in which mortgage servicers must perform activities intended to avoid or mitigate loss on insured mortgages that are delinquent 
the mortgage insurance industry is subject to litigation risk 
consumers are bringing a growing number of lawsuits against home mortgage lenders and settlement service providers 
in recent years  seven mortgage insurers  including the company s mgic subsidiary  have been involved in litigation alleging violations of the real estate settlement procedures act  which is commonly known as respa  and the fair credit reporting act  which is commonly known as fcra 
mgic s settlement of class action litigation against it under respa became final in october mgic settled the named plaintiffs claims in litigation against it under fcra in late december following denial of class certification in june there can be no assurance that mgic will not be subject to future litigation under respa or fcra 
net premiums written could be adversely affected if the department of housing and urban development reproposes and adopts a regulation under the real estate settlement procedures act that is equivalent to a proposed regulation that was withdrawn in the regulations of the department of housing and urban development under the real estate settlement procedures act prohibit paying lenders for the referral of settlement services  including mortgage insurance  and prohibit lenders from receiving such payments 
in july  the department of housing and urban development proposed a regulation that would exclude from these anti referral fee provisions settlement services included in a package of settlement services offered to a borrower at a guaranteed price 
hud withdrew this proposed regulation in march under the proposed regulation  if mortgage insurance was required on a loan  the package must include any mortgage insurance premium paid at settlement 
although certain state insurance regulations prohibit an insurer s payment of referral fees  had this regulation been adopted in this form  the company s revenues could have been adversely affected to the extent that lenders offered such packages and received value from the company in excess of what they could have received were the anti referral fee provisions of the real estate settlement procedures act to apply and if such state regulations were not applied to prohibit such payments 
the company s income from joint ventures could be adversely affected by credit losses  insufficient liquidity or competition affecting the business of c bass or sherman 
c bass c bass is particularly exposed to credit risk and funding risk 
in addition  c bass s results are sensitive to its ability to purchase mortgage loans and securities on terms that it projects will meets its return targets 

table of contents with respect to credit risk  an increasing proportion of non conforming mortgage originations the types of mortgages c bass principally purchases  are products  such as interest only loans to subprime borrowers  that are viewed by c bass as having greater credit risk 
in addition  credit losses are a function of housing prices  which in certain regions have experienced rates of increase greater than historical norms and greater than growth in median incomes 
with respect to liquidity  the substantial majority of c bass s on balance sheet financing for its mortgage and securities portfolio is short term and dependent on the value of the collateral that secures this debt 
while c bass s policies governing the management of capital at risk are intended to provide sufficient liquidity to cover an instantaneous and substantial decline in value  such policies cannot guaranty that all liquidity required will in fact be available 
although there has been growth in the volume of non conforming mortgage originations in recent years  such growth may not continue if interest rates increase or the economy weakens 
there is an increasing amount of competition to purchase non conforming mortgages  including from newly established real estate investment trusts and from firms that in the past acted as mortgage securities intermediaries but which are now establishing their own captive origination capacity 
the continuing decrease in credit spreads has also heightened competition in the purchase of non conforming mortgages and other securities 
sherman sherman s results are sensitive to its ability to purchase receivable portfolios on terms that it projects will meets its return targets 
while the volume of charged off consumer receivables and the portion of these receivables that have been sold to third parties such as sherman has grown in recent years  there is an increasing amount of competition to purchase such portfolios  including from new entrants to the industry  which has resulted in increases in the prices at which portfolios can be purchased 
the march acquisition of first national bank of marin is intended to provide sherman with the capability to originate subprime credit card receivables 
this acquisition has materially increased sherman s assets as well as its debt and its financial leverage 
there can be no assurance that the benefits projected from the acquisition by sherman will be achieved 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   the company s derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio were immaterial 
the company places its investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in the company s investment policy guidelines  the policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument 
at december   the effective duration of the company s fixed income investment portfolio was years 
this means that for an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of basis points there would be an approximate change in the market value of the company s fixed income portfolio 
the company s borrowings under its commercial paper program are subject to interest rates that are variable 
a discussion of the company s interest rate swaps appears in the fourth and fifth paragraphs of item of this annual report on form k under liquidity and capital resources and such discussion is incorporated by reference
