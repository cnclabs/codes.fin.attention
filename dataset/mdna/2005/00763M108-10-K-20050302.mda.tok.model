table of contents overview we are a global leader in the development  manufacture and marketing of medical devices for the eye and contact lens care products 
our products in the ophthalmic surgical market include intraocular lenses  phacoemulsification systems  viscoelastics and surgical packs used in cataract surgery  and microkeratomes used in refractive surgery 
our eye care products include disinfecting solutions to destroy harmful microorganisms in and on the surface of contact lenses  daily cleaners to remove undesirable film and deposits from contact lenses  enzymatic cleaners to remove protein deposits from contact lenses and lens rewetting drops to provide added wearing comfort 
our eye care products also include contact lenses  beginning in we have operations in approximately countries and sell our products in approximately countries and have organized our operations into four regions americas north and south america  europe  africa and middle east  japan  and asia pacific excluding japan  but including australia and new zealand 
pending acquisition of visx  incorporated on november   we entered into an agreement with visx  incorporated visx  the global leader in laser vision correction  to acquire visx for a combination of cash and stock with an estimated value of approximately billion on the announcement date 
visx manufactures excimer laser systems  associated diagnostic devices  and treatment cards 
under the terms of the definitive agreement  visx stockholders are expected to receive shares of our common stock and in cash for every share of visx common stock they own 
the transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of for a description of the risks related to this transaction  see risks relating to the merger with visx  incorporated beginning on page acquisition of pfizer inc surgical ophthalmic business on june   we completed the acquisition of the pfizer inc surgical ophthalmic business for million in cash acquisition 
we acquired ophthalmic surgical products and certain manufacturing and research and development facilities located in uppsala  sweden  groningen  netherlands and bangalore  india 
the products acquired include the healon line of viscoelastic products used in ocular surgery  the ceeon and tecnis intraocular lenses and the baerveldt glaucoma shunt 
these assets generated sales of approximately million in the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase business combination 
under the purchase method of accounting  the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition  at their respective fair values 
our reported financial position and results of operations after june  reflect these values 
the impact of purchase accounting resulted in significant charges in the year ended december   including an in process research and development charge of million and incremental cost of sales of million from the sale of acquired inventory adjusted to fair value 
during the year  we also incurred other acquisition related charges totaling approximately million as we integrated the pfizer surgical ophthalmic business and eliminated duplicative functions 
separation from allergan allergan spun off its existing optical medical device business by contributing all of the assets related to the two business lines that comprise the optical medical device business to us and distributing all of our outstanding shares of common stock to its stockholders 
we had no material assets  liabilities or activities as a separate corporate entity until allergan s contribution to us of the optical medical device business 
the contribution of assets and distribution to allergan stockholders was completed on june  as a result of the spin off  we are an independent public company and allergan no longer maintains any stock ownership in us 
allergan did not account for our business on the basis of separate legal entities  subsidiaries  divisions or segments 
the accompanying consolidated financial statement for the year ended december  through june  includes those 
table of contents revenues and expenses directly attributable to our operations and allocations of certain allergan corporate expenses 
these amounts have been allocated on a basis that was considered by allergan management to reflect most fairly or reasonably the utilization of the services provided to us or the benefit obtained by us 
all material intercompany balances have been eliminated 
the financial information included herein does not necessarily reflect what the results of our operations would have been had we operated as a stand alone public entity during the pre spin off period presented  and may not be indicative of our future operations 
prior to the spin off  we participated in various allergan administered functions including shared services surrounding selling  general and administrative expenses  retirement and other post retirement benefit plans  income taxes and cash management 
our allocated portion of the expenses for these services are included in selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations 
for the year ended december  through june   these allocated expenses were million 
prior to the spin off  our income had been included in consolidated income tax returns filed by allergan  and most of the related income taxes had been paid by allergan 
allergan had managed its tax position for the benefit of its entire portfolio of businesses 
allergan s tax methodologies and elections are not necessarily reflective of the tax methodologies and elections that we would have followed or follow as a stand alone company 
our income tax expense has been recorded as if we filed tax returns separate from allergan 
prior to the spin off  we entered into several agreements with allergan in connection with  among other things  transitional services  employee matters  manufacturing and tax sharing 
the transitional services agreement set forth charges generally intended to allow allergan to fully recover the allocated costs of providing certain services  plus all out of pocket costs and expenses  except that we paid to allergan a commission related to our products that were sold by them during the transition period 
we recovered costs from allergan in a similar manner for services provided by us 
all transitional services provided under this agreement have terminated 
under the manufacturing agreement  allergan manufactures certain of our eye care products and vitrax viscoelastics for a period of up to three years from the date of the spin off 
we purchase these products from allergan at a price equal to allergan s fully allocated costs plus 
during  and subsequent to the spin off  we purchased million  million and million  respectively  of product from allergan 
on an annual basis  a pricing true up calculation is to be performed during the first calendar quarter 
this true up calculation is based upon the actual volume of products shipped by allergan to us during the preceding year versus the forecasted volume submitted by us that was used to calculate the invoiced prices 
during the year  we periodically review the volume of purchases and accrue for estimated shortfalls  if any 
in march  we made a payment of million to allergan based upon the true up calculation for the year ended december  in march  we received a payment of million from allergan based upon the true up calculation for the period subsequent to the spin off through december  these payments have been recorded as an increase decrease to cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we are currently transitioning to our own manufacturing facilities 
if we are unable to obtain regulatory approvals for new facilities or locate and obtain regulatory approvals for third party manufacturers to produce our products in a timely fashion  our business may be negatively impacted 
the tax sharing agreement governs allergan s and our respective rights  responsibilities and obligations with respect to taxes for any tax period ending before  on or after the spin off 
generally  allergan is liable for all pre spin off taxes except for pre spin off taxes attributable to our business for in addition  the tax sharing agreement provides that allergan is liable for taxes that are incurred as a result of restructuring activities undertaken to effectuate the spin off 
we and allergan have made representations to each other and to the internal revenue service in connection with the private letter ruling that allergan has received regarding the tax free nature of the spin off of our common stock by allergan to its stockholders 
if either we or allergan breach our representations to each other or to the internal revenue service  or if we or allergan take or fail to take  as the case may be  actions that result in the spin off failing to meet the requirements of a tax free spin off pursuant to section of the internal revenue code  the party in breach will indemnify the other party for any and all resulting taxes 
as two years have passed since the spin off  the likelihood that we will be liable for any taxes resulting from a determination by the internal revenue service that the spin off was not of a tax free nature is considered remote 
however  in the unlikely event we are found to have breached our representations to allergan or to the internal revenue service in connection with the private letter ruling  we may be liable for the resulting taxes 
we do not believe such amount will exceed million 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition and accounts receivable revenue is realized or realizable and earned when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price to the buyer is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record revenue from product sales when title and risk of ownership has been transferred to the customer  which is typically upon delivery to the customer  with the exception of intraocular lenses distributed on a consignment basis  which is upon notification of implantation in a patient 
we generally permit returns of product if such product is returned in a timely matter  in good condition  and through the normal channels of distribution 
return policies in certain international markets can be more stringent and are based on the terms of contractual agreements with the customers 
allowances for returns are provided for based upon an analysis of our historical patterns of returns matched against the sales from which they originated 
to date  historical product returns have been within our estimates 
when we recognize revenue from the sale of our products  certain allowances known and estimable at time of sale are recorded as a reduction to sales 
these items include cash discounts  allowances and rebates 
these items are reflected as a reduction to accounts receivable to the extent the customer will or is expected to reduce its payment on the related invoice amounts 
in addition  certain items such as rebates provided to customers that meet certain buying targets are paid to the customer subsequent to customer payment 
thus  such amounts are recorded as accrued liabilities 
these provisions are estimated based on historical payment experience  historical relationship to revenues and estimated customer inventory levels 
if the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not properly reflect future activity  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be impacted 
to date  historical sales allowances have been within our estimates 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of uncollectibility based on insolvency  disputes or other collection issues 
in addition  we routinely analyze the different aging categories and establish allowances based on the length of time receivables are past due 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of first in  first out cost or market 
on a regular basis  we evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence by analyzing estimated demand  inventory on hand  sales levels and other information 
based on these evaluations  inventory balances are reduced  if necessary 
goodwill and long lived assets on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  whereby goodwill is no longer amortized  but instead is subject to a periodic impairment review performed during the second quarter of each fiscal year 
in a business combination  goodwill is allocated to our various reporting units  which are the same as our reportable operating segments based on relative fair value of the asset acquired and liabilities assumed 
as our operations are composed of four reporting units americas  europe africa middle east  japan and asia pacific  we review the recoverability of goodwill by comparing each unit s fair value to the net book value of its assets 
if the book value of the reporting unit s assets exceeds its fair value  the goodwill is written down to its implied fair value 
additionally  we review the carrying amount of goodwill whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
impairment indicators include  among other conditions  cash flow deficits  historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit and adverse legal or regulatory develops 
if it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that goodwill will not be fully recoverable  based upon discounted estimated cash flows  the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair market value 
estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
in the second quarters of  and  we performed the annual impairment tests of goodwill  and no impairment was indicated based on these tests 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we assess potential impairment to our long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
if required  an impairment loss is recognized as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the assets 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we evaluate the need to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets based upon the amount of existing temporary differences  the period in which they are expected to be recovered and expected levels of taxable income 
a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
stock based compensation we measure stock based compensation for option grants to employees and members of the board of directors using the intrinsic value method 
the fair value of each option grant for determining the pro forma impact of stock based compensation expense is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with weighted average assumptions 
these assumptions consist of expected dividend yield  expected volatility  expected life  and risk free interest rate 
if the assumptions used to calculate the value of each option grant do not properly reflect future activity  the weighted average fair value of our grants could be impacted 
acquired in process research and development costs to acquire in process research and development ipr d projects and technologies which have no alternative future use and which have not reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition are expensed as incurred 
the fair value of ipr d projects and technologies is estimated based upon management s assumptions such as projected regulatory approval dates  estimated future revenues and cost of goods sold of the products under development and expected sales and marketing costs 
the major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of these projects consist of the ability to confirm the safety and efficacy of the technology based on the data from clinical trials and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals 
in addition  no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of such projects will materialize  as estimated 
for these reasons  among others  actual results may vary from the estimated results

our gross margin percentage decreased as a percent of net sales by percentage points to in from in gross profit for included a charge of million million  net of tax  or percentage point impact on gross margin percentage  for manufacturing profit capitalized in inventory and expensed related to the acquisition 
in addition  pre production costs incurred at our manufacturing facility in madrid  spain  costs incurred for expansion of our manufacturing facility in hangzhou  china  and higher costs of product supplied by allergan contributed to the gross margin percentage decrease  which was partially offset by sales growth in the higher margin complete branded line of eye care products and sales of the healon family of viscoelastics 
in  we expect our gross margin percentage to be favorably impacted as we fully transition manufacturing of our eye care products from allergan and continue to shift our sales mix to higher margin products  including the healon family of viscoelastics and the sensar intraocular lens 
our gross margin percentage remained relatively constant in as compared to our gross margin in was negatively impacted by the june write off of million of inventory deemed unusable due to our spin off from allergan 
selling  general and administrative

amortization of intangible assets was million and million in and  respectively 
in  selling  general and administrative expenses also include an additional million in acquisition integration related charges 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percent of net sales by percentage points to in from in this increase was primarily the result of increased sales and marketing efforts in the global eye care business and incremental costs associated with running an independent public company 
additionally  we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by million and million in and  respectively  primarily as a result of deterioration in the aging of certain customer accounts in europe 
research and development 
research and development expenditures as a percent of net sales remained relatively constant in as compared to and increased by percentage points to in from in as a result of our continued investment in research and development and other business development activities  we launched our new vitreal retinal system  amo gemini  in europe  the stabileyes capsular tension ring in north america  the rezoom intraocular lens in europe  an advanced formulation of our blink contact lens rewetter in the us and europe  the complete aquavision contact lens in europe and the verisyse phakic intraocular lens for correction of myopia in the us in  we expect to bring to market the rezoom intraocular lens and vitrax ii in the us and several new eye care products in japan 
in process research and development 
in  we incurred an in process research and development ipr d charge of million million  net of tax related to the acquisition 
this charge represented the estimated fair value of projects that  as of the acquisition date  had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the estimated fair value assigned to ipr d was comprised of the following projects tecnis monofocal million and 
table of contents tecnis multifocal million 
the estimated fair value of these ipr d projects was estimated by performing a discounted cash flow analysis using the income approach 
for each project  the estimated after tax cash flows were probability weighted to take into account the stage of completion and the risks surrounding the successful development and commercialization 
these cash flows were then discounted to a present value using a discount rate of 
regulatory approval for the tecnis monofocal in japan is expected in we also estimate that the tecnis multifocal will receive its pma in the us in  with approval in japan in additional research and development expenses in the range of million to million and million to million for the tecnis monofocal and the tecnis multifocal  respectively  represent our best estimate as to the additional research and development expenses to bring these products to market 
these projects are currently on track for these approval dates 
however  the major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of these projects consist of the ability to confirm the safety and efficacy of the technology based on the data from clinical trials and obtaining the necessary approvals 
we can provide no assurance that the approvals will be received on this schedule or at all 
operating income 
operating income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our operating income included an aggregate million million  net of tax in charges related to the manufacturing profit capitalized in inventory and expensed  the distributor contract termination and severance and in process research and development as discussed above 
non operating expense 
interest expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  interest expense included a net charge of million million  net of tax comprised of a charge of million for the pro rata write off of debt issuance costs and write off of original issue discount and one time commitment fees net of a net realized gain on interest rate swaps of million  all associated with the prepayment of the japan term loan in june  consummation of the june tender offer for million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes senior subordinated notes  the exchange of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes existing notes and partial prepayment of the million june term loan

loss on investments is comprised of a million charge for the other than temporary impairment of equity investments in we recorded an unrealized loss on derivative instruments of million  million and million in  and respectively 
we record as unrealized loss gain on derivative instruments the mark to market adjustments on the outstanding foreign currency options which we entered into or were allocated as part of allergan s overall risk management strategy to reduce the volatility of expected earnings in currencies other than the us dollar 
the loss due to exchange of convertible senior subordinated notes due of million is comprised of a non cash charge of million million  net of tax and a cash charge of million million  net of tax 
in the quarter ended june   we exchanged approximately million shares of common stock and million of cash for approximately million in aggregate principal amount of these notes 
because these notes were not convertible into equity at such time  a non cash charge of million and a cash charge of million was recorded 
the million non cash charge was comprised of a charge of million representing the difference between the fair market value of million shares of common stock issued in exchange for the notes and the principal amount of notes exchanged and a charge of million representing the fair market value of million shares of common stock issued as a premium 
the million cash charge represented cash issued as a premium 
in the remainder of  we exchanged approximately million shares of common stock for approximately million in aggregate principal amount of these notes 
as a result  a non cash charge of million representing the fair value of shares issued as a premium was recorded 
in the future  additional losses may be incurred  if we exchange additional shares of common stock for all or a portion of the remaining notes 
other non operating expense of million for included million paid for the repurchase of the senior subordinated notes and early debt extinguishment costs and fees of million aggregating million million  net of taxes partially offset by foreign exchange gains and interest income

table of contents a foreign currency gain of million resulting from the settlement of certain intercompany notes and related transfer of cash utilized for the prepayment of a term loan and partial repurchase of senior subordinated notes  which aggregated million million  net of taxes 
other non operating expense of million in included early debt extinguishment costs of million million  net of tax associated with the prepayment of debt in japan in june partially offset by foreign exchange gains 
income taxes 
in  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million even though we had a pre tax loss of million 
we recorded such provision as no tax benefit has been recognized for the in process research and development charge of million nor for the aggregate charge of million related to the exchange of the existing notes 
income taxes are provided on taxable income at the statutory rates applicable to such income and we have provided for us federal income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries 
we believe our future effective income tax rate may vary depending on our mix of domestic and international taxable income or loss and the various tax and treasury methodologies that we implement  including our policy regarding repatriation of future accumulated foreign earnings 
we expect our effective tax rate on continuing operations to continue to be in the low to mid percent range in the american jobs creation act of was signed into law in october  which allows companies to elect to repatriate cash into the united states in at a special  temporary effective tax rate of percent 
our evaluation of the amount of foreign earnings that we may elect to treat under this special provision  and the financial statement impact  is in process 
as such  we are not in a position to decide on whether  and to what extent  our foreign earnings will be affirmatively designated for this treatment 
the related potential range of the income tax effect of the repatriation cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
we expect to be in a position to finalize our assessment by the end of the third quarter in our effective tax rate in was  as compared to in the decrease in was primarily attributable to the utilization of foreign tax credits 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting by a company for the income tax effects of transactions among or with its shareholders under fasb statement no 
 we established deferred tax assets of approximately million as of december  through a credit to equity for all differences resulting from the spin off in the financial reporting and tax bases of certain assets and liabilities 
these differences occurred in jurisdictions where the transfer of assets and liabilities to us in the spin off was deemed to be a taxable transaction 
in such situations  the tax bases were adjusted to reflect the fair market value of the assets and liabilities on the spin off date whereas the financial reporting bases were unchanged 
net earnings loss 
net earnings loss was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the net loss in included an aggregate after tax charge of million related to the following the manufacturing profit capitalized in inventory and expensed related to the acquisition  the charge to terminate a distributor contract following the decision to move to a direct sales model in belgium as a result of the acquisition and severance paid to amo employees considered redundant upon completion of the acquisition  the in process research and development charge related to the acquisition  the pro rata write off of debt issuance costs and write off of original issue discount net of a net realized gain on interest rate swaps  and the charges related to the repurchase of the senior subordinated notes and the exchange of the existing notes 
net earnings in included an aggregate after tax charge of million related to the pro rata write off of debt issuance costs and write off of original issue discount net of a net realized gain on interest rate swaps and a net charge related to the prepayment of a term loan and partial repurchase of senior subordinated notes 
net earnings in included the after tax charge of million related to the prepayment of debt in japan 
seasonality 
historically  we have realized a seasonal trend in our sales  with the smallest portion of our ophthalmic surgical sales being realized in the first quarter and with sales gradually increasing from the second to fourth quarter 
we believe sales of our ophthalmic surgical products are comparatively higher in the fourth quarter because hospitals  ambulatory surgical centers and other customers increase spending as they reach their year end and are able to spend the remainder of their annual budgeted amounts 
as a result of acquisitions and expanded product offerings  we expect to realize less seasonality in future periods as we seek to diversify our sales geographically and with more products that are less seasonal 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources management assesses our liquidity by our ability to generate cash to fund operations 
significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations  levels of accounts receivable  inventories  accounts payable and capital expenditures  adequate lines of credit  and financial flexibility to attract long term capital on satisfactory terms 
as of december   we had cash and equivalents of million 
historically  we have generated cash from operations in excess of working capital requirements  and we expect to do so in the future 
net cash provided by operating activities in was million compared to million in and million in operating cash flow decreased in compared to primarily as a result of early debt extinguishment costs paid in cash and an increase in accounts receivable partially offset by an increase in accounts payable 
the increase in accounts receivable and accounts payable is primarily due to increased activities resulting from the acquisition and the ongoing transition of eye care manufacturing from allergan 
additionally  in february  we received approximately million from allergan 
this payment ended a dispute between us and allergan regarding the ownership of a certain value added tax receivable due from france 
as part of the settlement with allergan  we were responsible for paying penalties and expenses associated with the receivable  which aggregated less than million 
operating cash flow decreased in compared to primarily as a result of lower net earnings due to the additional costs of our operations as an independent company  early debt extinguishment costs and a decrease in accounts payable 
the capital expenditures are primarily comprised of expansion of our manufacturing facilities in preparation for the transition away from the allergan manufacturing agreement  expenditures at the acquired manufacturing facilities and construction of research and development facilities at our leased headquarters 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the amount includes the million acquisition purchase price  which was financed with a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of million of notes and a million term loan noted below 
in november  we completed the purchase of an existing manufacturing facility in madrid  spain 
we financed the approximately million purchase of this facility with available cash and borrowings under our senior credit facility 
expenditures for property  plant and equipment totaled million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
we expect to incur significant capital expenditures with respect to the uppsala  sweden manufacturing facility during the next two years in order to separate the facility from existing pfizer operations 
the decrease in expenditures in as compared to is primarily due to the large amount of improvements to our leased headquarters during the expenditures were primarily comprised of improvements to our leased headquarters and also include expansion of manufacturing facilities and a variety of other projects designed to improve productivity 
expenditures for demonstration demo and bundled equipment  primarily phacoemulsification and microkeratome surgical equipment  were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
we maintain demo and bundled equipment to facilitate future sales of similar equipment and related products to our customers 
expenditures for capitalized internal use software were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
we capitalize internal use software costs after technical feasibility has been established 
in  we expect to invest approximately million to million in property  plant and equipment  demo and bundled equipment  and capitalized software as part of the overall expansion of our business 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  which was primarily comprised of million of proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior subordinated notes due notes and a million term loan  partially offset by repayment of debt of million and financing related costs of million 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  which was primarily comprised of million of long term debt borrowings and million from the sale of stock to employees reduced by long term debt repayments of million and financing related costs of million 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  which was comprised of million of long term debt borrowings and million of net proceeds from the settlement of an interest rate swap offset by long term debt repayments of million  financing related costs of million and million of net distributions to allergan 
a majority of cash generated from operations prior to june  was transferred to allergan 
net transfers to allergan ceased as of june  as a result of the spin off 
in  the following transactions occurred our japan subsidiary repaid its billion  approximately million  term loan facility  we consummated the offering of million of the notes  we consummated a tender offer to repurchase the remaining million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes  and we exchanged million aggregate principal amount of existing notes for common stock and cash 
in addition  in june we amended and restated our senior credit facility to provide a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
as of december   we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility and the term loan balance had been reduced to million 

table of contents in january  we entered into an amendment to our senior credit facility to provide for an increase by million in the revolving loan commitments and an additional million in term loan commitments 
we expect to utilize this additional million to fund certain transaction fees and the cash consideration portion of the proposed acquisition of visx  incorporated  which we announced on november  the senior credit facility provides that we will maintain certain financial and operating covenants which include  among other provisions  maintaining specific leverage and interest coverage ratios 
certain covenants under the senior credit facility and the indenture relating to the senior subordinated notes also limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness 
the senior credit facility prohibits cash dividend payments 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  our cash position includes amounts denominated in foreign currencies  and the repatriation of those cash balances from some of our non us subsidiaries may result in additional tax costs 
however  these cash balances are generally available without legal restriction to fund ordinary business operations 
we believe that the net cash provided by our operating activities  supplemented as necessary with borrowings available under our revolving credit facility and existing cash and equivalents  will provide sufficient resources to provide the required funding for the proposed acquisition of visx  incorporated  to fund the expected capital expenditures  and to meet our working capital requirements  debt service and other cash needs over the next year 
we are partially dependent upon the reimbursement policies of government and private health insurance companies 
government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs  including price regulation and competitive pricing  are continuing in many countries where we do business 
as a result of these changes  the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost effective medical therapies 
while we have been unaware of significant price resistance resulting from the trend toward cost containment  changes in reimbursement policies and other reimbursement methodologies and payment levels could have an adverse effect on our pricing flexibility 
additionally  the current trend among us hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers is to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power 
the enhanced purchasing power of these larger customers may also increase the pressure on product pricing  although we are unable to estimate the potential impact at this time 
inflation 
although at reduced levels in recent years  inflation may cause upward pressure on the cost of goods and services used by us 
the competitive and regulatory environments in many markets substantially limit our ability to fully recover these higher costs through increased selling prices 
we continually seek to mitigate the adverse effects of inflation through cost containment and improved productivity and manufacturing processes 
foreign currency fluctuations 
approximately   and of our revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively  were derived from operations outside the united states  and a significant portion of our cost structure is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the japanese yen and the euro 
therefore  we are subject to fluctuations in sales and earnings reported in us dollars as a result of changing currency exchange rates 
the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on sales was a million  million and million increase in  and  respectively 
the sales increases were due primarily to a strengthening of the japanese yen and euro versus the us dollar 

table of contents contractual obligations 
the following represents a list of our material contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by year thereafter total in millions long term debt  principal amount cash commitments for interest expense operating lease obligations it services other purchase obligations  primarily purchases of inventory and capital equipment new accounting standards in september  the emerging issues task force finalized its consensus on eitf issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share eitf 
eitf addresses when the dilutive effect of contingently convertible debt with a market price trigger should be included in diluted earnings per share eps 
under eitf  the market price contingency should be ignored and these securities should be treated as non contingent  convertible securities and always included in the diluted eps computation 
eitf requires these securities be included in diluted eps using either the if converted method or the net share settlement method  depending on the conversion terms of the security 
eitf is effective for all periods ending after december  and is to be applied by retrospectively restating previously reported eps 
we irrevocably elected to cash settle the principal amount of the notes and thus  the dilutive effect of the notes was calculated under the net share settlement method 
adoption of eitf did not have an impact on eps for the years ended december  and  as the impact of the existing notes  which were issued in june  is antidilutive 
in november  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
 was issued 
this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued a revision of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance and eliminates the alternative to use opinion s intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided in statement as originally issued 
under opinion  issuing stock options to employees generally resulted in recognition of no compensation cost 
sfas no 
r requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
sfas no 
r is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  we have not quantified the potential effect of adoption of sfas no 
r 
however  we believe adoption of sfas no 
r will result in a decrease to our reporting earnings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we routinely monitor our risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we address these risks through controlled risk management that may include the use of derivative financial instruments to economically hedge or reduce these exposures 
we do not expect to enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
for fiscal through june   we were considered in allergan s overall risk management strategy 
as part of this strategy  allergan managed its risks based on management s judgment of the appropriate trade off between risk  opportunity and costs 
with respect to our risks  allergan primarily utilized foreign currency option and forward contracts to economically hedge or reduce these exposures 
given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to be hedged  there can be no assurance that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either interest or foreign exchange rates 
in addition  the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark to market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and  therefore  may adversely affect our operating results and financial position 

table of contents to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our interest rate and foreign exchange hedge positions  we continually monitor  from an accounting and economic perspective  our interest rate swap positions and foreign exchange forward and option positions  when applicable  both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with our underlying interest rate and foreign currency exposures 
interest rate risk 
at december   our debt is comprised solely of domestic borrowings and is comprised of million of fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt 
in july  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which effectively converts the interest rate on million of term loan borrowings from a floating rate to a fixed rate 
this interest rate swap matures in july and qualifies as a cash flow hedge 
changes in fair value of the interest rate swap agreement are recorded in other comprehensive income to the extent such changes are effective and as long as the cash flow hedge requirements are met 
at december   the fair value of million of the interest rate swap is recorded in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
we had previously entered into various interest rate swap agreements  which effectively converted the interest rate on million of the senior subordinated notes from a fixed to a floating rate and converted the interest rate on million of term loan borrowings from a floating to a fixed rate 
the interest rate swaps had maturity dates beginning in and qualified as either fair value or cash flow hedges 
changes in fair value of the interest rate swap agreement qualifying as a cash flow hedge were recorded in other comprehensive income to the extent such changes were effective and as long as the cash flow hedge requirements were met 
in may and october  we realized the value of the interest rate swaps qualifying as fair value hedges 
we received an aggregate of approximately million  of which approximately million represented the net settlement of the accrued but unpaid amount between us and the swap counterparties 
the remaining amount of approximately million was recorded as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the senior subordinated notes as a premium and was being amortized over the remaining life of the senior subordinated notes 
at december   after recognizing a pro rata portion of the gain upon repurchase of a portion of the senior subordinated notes  the unamortized gain on these interest rate swaps was million 
as a result of the june repurchase of the remaining senior subordinated notes  the remaining unamortized gain on the interest rate swaps was fully recognized 
in may  we terminated the interest rate swap qualifying as a cash flow hedge 
we paid approximately million and included the related loss of approximately million as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
as a result of the prepayment of the term loan in june  the loss on the interest rate swap was fully recognized as interest expense

overall  we are a net recipient of currencies other than the us dollar and  as such  we benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may negatively affect our consolidated net sales and gross profit as expressed in us dollars 
we may enter into foreign exchange option and forward contracts to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes to allow management to focus its attention on its core business operations 
accordingly  we enter into contracts which change in value as foreign exchange rates change to economically offset the effect of changes in value of foreign currency assets and liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated sales and operating expenses 
we enter into foreign exchange option and forward contracts in amounts between minimum and maximum anticipated foreign exchange exposures  generally for periods not to exceed one year 
we use foreign currency option contracts  which provide for the sale of foreign currencies to offset foreign currency exposures expected to arise in the normal course of our business 
while these instruments are subject to fluctuations in value  such fluctuations are anticipated to offset changes in the value of the underlying exposures 
the principal currencies subject to this process are the japanese yen and the euro 
the foreign currency options are entered into to reduce the volatility of earnings generated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily earnings denominated in japanese yen and the euro 
as a result  the changes in the fair value of outstanding foreign currency option contracts are recorded through earnings as unrealized loss gain on derivative instruments while any realized gains or losses on expired contracts are recorded through earnings as other  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the premium cost of purchased foreign exchange option contracts are recorded in other current assets and amortized over the life of the options 
as part of allergan s risk management strategy  foreign exchange forward contracts were entered into to protect the value of foreign currency denominated intercompany receivables and the changes in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts were economically designed to offset the changes in the revaluation of the foreign currency denominated intercompany receivables 
as a result  our allocated portion of current changes in both the foreign currency forward contracts and revaluation of the foreign currency denominated intercompany receivables was recorded through other  net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for fiscal at december   the aggregate notional amounts and strike amounts of our outstanding yen and euro currency option contracts were million and and million and  respectively 
at december   the aggregate notional amounts and strike amounts of outstanding yen and euro currency option contracts were million and and million and  respectively 
the notional principal amount provides one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of year end  and does not represent the amount of our exposure to market loss 
the fair value of the foreign currency option contracts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the estimate of fair value is based on applicable and commonly used prevailing financial market information as of december  the amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments  together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures  will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments 

table of contents through june   our allocated portion of changes in the revaluation of foreign currency forward contracts and changes in the fair value of foreign currency option contracts was based on our percentage of net sales compared to total allergan net sales 
in the last half of and as part of the transitional services agreement with allergan  we paid to allergan the costs of certain yen denominated foreign currency option contracts previously entered into by allergan 
the impact of foreign exchange risk management transactions on income was a net realized loss of million  million and million in  and  respectively  and are recorded in other  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations
