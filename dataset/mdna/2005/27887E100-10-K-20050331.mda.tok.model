item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data set forth in item of this annual report on form k and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition  accounting for stock based compensation  accounting for the issuance of debt obligations  valuation of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  amortization of intangible assets  software development costs and income taxes are all critical accounting policies for the company 
these policies have been discussed with  and are evaluated by  our audit committee and are substantially consistent with the policies in effect during each of these policies is discussed in detail below  as well as in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy for our company  as it affects the timing of when we recognize the fees we charge our customers for our services 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  as modified by sab  which provides guidance on revenue recognition for public companies 
revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we follow eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  to identify units of accounting in revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
elearning we enter into contracts with our customers to provide our online learning products and services 
our contracts typically have initial terms of one to five years  with an average term of approximately three years 
each contract specifies the type and price of the online campus purchased and the number and price of online courses purchased  as well as the fees for student enrollments and any other products or services purchased 
since our customer contracts are generally applicable campus wide  colleges and universities can add new online programs and schools without the need to negotiate new contract terms 
the majority of our elearning division revenue is earned by charging a per enrollment student technology service fee to our customers for access to their ecourses and our help desk 
we also offer a pricing model for our ecompanion product under which we charge an annual license fee for up to a predetermined number of users 
for our program administration solutions  we generally charge a one time set up and design fee to implement an online campus  and an annual license  hosting  and maintenance fee for access to our software 
we generally sell our course development services on a per course basis  although we also offer customers the option to purchase blocks of course development service hours with pricing based on our standard hourly rates 
fees for other professional consulting services are based on our standard hourly rates 
student fees are recognized on a per enrollment basis over each course s specific academic term or over the length of the student fee license purchased by the customer  depending upon contract terms 
no billing occurs  and no revenue is recognized  for cancelled classes and student withdrawals or drops that occur before the agreed upon enrollment census date that is the basis for amounts billed 
campus license  hosting  and maintenance fees  including the design and development of a customer s campus  are recognized on a straight line basis from the campus launch date through the end of the relevant contract period or the expected life of the customer relationship  whichever is greater 
the average recognition period for these campus fees is approximately three years 
course development fees are recognized on a straight line basis over the approximate period over which our services are provided and our obligation to the customer is fulfilled 
if a customer has purchased a block of course design and development consulting hours  we recognize such hourly fees as the work is performed 
if a customer has contracted with us to build a unique online course  we generally recognize such fees over a period of nine months  which approximates the length of time over which we complete our work and fulfill our obligations to the customer 
the period over which we perform the services and therefore recognize the revenue may change in the future as our actual experience in completing development obligations continues to evolve 
changes in our contract terms and expected customer life may also affect the period over which campus and course development fees are recognized in the future 
all other revenue sources are recognized at the time of the performance of the service eg  training  instructional design  and technical consulting or over the length of the service period eg  annual evaluation solutions license fees 
enrollment our enrollment division revenues are primarily generated from the sale of direct mail  interactive marketing  and media placement services 
we also derive revenue from research services  admissions training  and retention services 
it is our practice to execute contracts or work orders of various lengths  typically up to three months for one project  for direct mail advertising campaigns 
individual direct mail projects typically take to business days to complete with payments due two days before marketing materials are mailed in most cases 
fees are determined based on the number of pieces mailed and the associated revenue is recognized when the marketing materials are mailed 
our pricing and revenue for direct mailings include all applicable postage costs 
interactive media arrangements usually last from three months to one year 
our pricing is based on a fee per lead generated model  with an up front payment or deposit due at the time the customer s agreement is signed and monthly invoices thereafter based on the number of leads generated 
payments received are recorded as customer advances a liability until the leads are generated  at which point the revenue is recognized 
we generally enter into master services agreements with clients for whom we provide media buying services 
we also execute an agency of record letter which identifies datamark as the agent authorized to make media placements on behalf of the customer 
smaller clients may not be required to execute master service agreements but are required to sign the agency of record letter 
we charge our customer for the cost of the advertisement placed with the third party media supplier eg newspaper  television  radio station  etc 
as well as a commission  typically in the amount of 
revenue is recognized when the media advertisements are run by the third party media supplier 
revenue is recorded on a net basis  meaning that we only include in our consolidated revenue the commission portion of the amount we charge  not the gross amount of fees charged to  and collected from  our customers 
accordingly  we also exclude the direct cost of the advertisement charged by the media supplier from our cost of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations 
we determined that media revenue should be recorded on a net basis  in accordance with eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  based on the fact that the third party media supplier and not datamark is responsible for ultimate fulfillment  including the acceptability of the products or services purchased by a customer  and therefore datamark does not have risks and rewards as principal in the media placement transactions 
furthermore  the fact that we earn a stated percentage of the amount billed to a customer is an indication that datamark is acting as an agent only 
other enrollment marketing revenue sources include retention services  admissions training and research services 
contracts for student retention services agreements have a length of not less than months and typically are for a period of one year 
we charge a fee based on the number of students actively enrolled in a particular month 
we also charge a one time fee for implementation of our retention product that is recognized as revenue over the contract period 
contracts for admissions training and research services are negotiated based on scope of work 
these services are provided on an hourly rate and are recognized at the time of the performance of the service or over the length of the service period 
stock based compensation stock based compensation is a critical accounting policy for our company due primarily to the significant judgment required when estimating the fair value of the stock based compensation awards  including the selection of a valuation method eg black scholes and the underlying assumptions within such valuation eg estimated lives outstanding and volatility of the awards 
prior to january   we accounted for stock options granted to employees and directors and other stock based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method of accounting in accordance with apb no 
and related interpretations 
under apb no 
 we generally did not record any stock based compensation expense for options granted to employees  provided the options had an exercise price equal to or above the market price of our common stock and the ultimate number of shares to be issued upon exercise was fixed on the day the option was granted 
as such  we recognized compensation expense for stock options only if the quoted market value of the company s common stock exceeded the exercise price of the option on the grant date 
during the fourth quarter of  we adopted sfas no 
effective january  for our employee stock option plans and other employee stock based compensation arrangements using the prospective method under sfas no 
this method applies the provisions of sfas no 
to all employee stock awards granted  modified or settled after january   and accordingly  we have recognized compensation expense for such awards made under our stock based employee compensation plans 
the fair values of restricted share rights are determined using the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant  while stock options and stock purchase awards are estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair values of stock appreciation rights are estimated at the date of grant using a monte carlo simulation for an asian type award 
the estimated fair values of awards are being amortized over the vesting period of the applicable award  generally to years 
the company recorded million of stock based compensation expense in and million of stock based compensation expense in  as compared to  in prior to the adoption of sfas no 
for stock awards granted prior to january   compensation expense has not been recognized under sfas no 
 in accordance with the prospective method of adoption allowed for under sfas no 
accordingly  and results are not directly comparable to prior years results in this regard 
however  as required by sfas no 
 we do present pro forma disclosures of our net income loss using the fair value based accounting model for awards granted prior to january   as shown in note to the consolidated financial statements include in item of this annual report 
on september   the company granted stock appreciation rights with respect to million shares of common stock to executives and certain other key employees 
the rights were granted under the terms and conditions of the company s stock incentive plan  as amended and approved by stockholders 
the rights will be settled in stock 
each grant is separated into five different levels of base prices to reflect minimum required levels of stockholder return over a five year performance period 
the base price for the first level is higher than the grant date stock price  and the base price for each successive level is higher than the previous level 
except in the case of a change in control of the company  as described below  a participant will receive a distribution with respect to the shares of common stock in each grant level only if the average closing price of our common stock for the last quarter in the five year term exceeds the base price for such shares 
each participant may elect to receive a distribution with respect to of the rights he or she was granted after the third anniversary of the grant and with respect to an additional after the fourth anniversary 
in the event of a change in control  participants will be entitled to receive a distribution with respect to a specified percentage of the shares granted if the change in control occurs on september   increasing by each month to on september   and will forfeit the right to receive a distribution with respect to the unvested portion of the shares 
the number of shares of common stock issued following a change in control will be based on the difference between the base prices and the share price as of the date the change in control occurs 
the fair value of each stock appreciation right was estimated on the date of grant using a monte carlo simulation for an asian type award 
on march   the company granted substantially the same recipients additional stock appreciation rights with respect to million shares of common stock 
such grants have the same terms as the grants except that they have different base prices and a new five year performance period beginning on the grant date 
in addition  the company may grant stock appreciation rights to new hires and in connection with promotions and other special circumstances 
compensation expense is recognized ratably over the five year vesting period 
effective november   the company amended its employee stock purchase plan to revise certain features 
the current two year offering period under the plan ends april  effective with the purchase interval that began on november  the ability of plan participants to increase contributions during an offering period has been eliminated as a reset feature that established a new offering period if the fair market value of the company s stock on any purchase date within an offering period was less than the fair market value at the beginning of the offering period 
effective may   the length of an offering period will be reduced from two years to one year and the length of each purchase interval will be increased from six months to one year 
the employee stock purchase plan has been and continues to be accounted for under the fair value method in accordance with sfas no 
 which requires that compensation expense be recognized for the fair value of awards 
debt obligations in october  the company financed a portion of the purchase of datamark with million face value senior subordinated secured notes senior subordinated notes issued to a lender and million face value subordinated seller notes seller notes 
the senior subordinated notes have principal payments due in million quarterly increments beginning on december   with interest payments due quarterly beginning on december   at a nominal rate of per annum 
the seller notes  with interest and principal due in  initially consisted of a series of notes aggregating million  with a stated interest rate of per annum  simple interest  and another series of notes aggregating million  with an interest rate of  interest compounded annually 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company estimated the fair value of the senior subordinated notes and the seller notes 
the initial fair value of the senior subordinated notes reflected a fair value adjustment to the notes for the estimated fair value of the warrants issued in connection with this debt see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for additional information concerning the warrants 
a significant amount of judgment was involved in management s estimate of the fair value of the warrants eg using the black scholes valuation model  estimated volatility and an expected life of the warrants 
the estimated fair value of the warrants at the date of issuance was million  and was recorded as a debt discount against the face value of the million senior subordinated notes 
this discount is being amortized as interest expense over the five year term of the senior subordinated notes using the interest method 
the effective interest rate on this debt is 
the carrying value of the senior subordinated notes was million at december   which includes amortization of warrant costs 
the initial fair value of the seller notes was determined by a third party who considered  among other factors  the effective interest rate of our senior subordinated notes  and other comparable debt securities 
the effective interest rate on this debt is 
in december the company repaid all of the million face value of simple interest notes and million face value of the annually compounding notes 
the carrying value of the repaid notes was million and the repayment resulted in a million charge for the write off of the unamortized discount on these notes 
the carrying value of the remaining seller notes was million at december   which includes amortization of the original discount recorded and accrued interest payable 
interest will accrue on the remaining notes until they are paid 
due to the discounts recorded when the senior subordinated notes and seller notes were issued  any further pre payments of these debt obligations prior to their maturity would again result in a significant amount of interest expense  since cash paid would exceed the discounted carrying amount 
goodwill and other intangible assets with the acquisition of datamark in october  we recorded million of the approximate million purchase price as goodwill and intangible assets 
significant judgment is required in establishing the fair value  determining appropriate amortization periods and assessing such intangibles  including goodwill  for impairment in the future 
it is possible that our review of such intangible assets in the future could determine that they are impaired and the amount of such impairment could be significant 
goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition costs over the net of the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and the fair value of liabilities assumed in acquisitions 
the company applied sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets in october and  in accordance with sfas no 
 there is no amortization of goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives 
however  such assets are tested for impairment annually 
the fair values of the intangible assets were recorded based upon valuations determined by a third party using the income and cost methods at the date of the acquisition 
the income method determines a value based upon estimated future cash flows and the cost method determines value based on what it would cost to replace the asset less depreciation and functional obsolescence 
based upon the nature of datamark s assets  the income approach was utilized to value the customer relationship intangible asset 
in performing the allocation  the assets were analyzed within the context of the datamark business enterprise 
the company considered this context to be representative of assumptions marketplace participants would use in analyzing the assets acquired 
in establishing the amortization period for the customer relationship intangible asset  the company considered the relative weighting of customer revenues and customer lives and determined that while certain customer relationships are expected to span as long as years  the economic benefit attributable to these customers generally declines in the final eight years as compared to the first eight years 
therefore  the company used an eight year period weighted average for determining amortization 
during the life of a customer relationship  a customer s revenue streams can increase and decrease  creating a pattern of economic benefit that is not reliably determinable 
therefore  the company has determined that a straight line amortization method over eight years is appropriate and representative of the economic benefits of the intangible asset 
in determining the value of the datamark trade name  the company utilized the relief from royalty method using a royalty rate applied to projected datamark sales streams 
in determining that the trade name intangible asset had an indefinite life  the company considered the following factors the ongoing active useful life of the trade name  the lack of any legal  regulatory  or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life of the trade name  the lack of any substantial costs to maintain the asset  the positive impact on the trade name generated by datamark s other ongoing business activities  and datamark s commitment to products being branded with its trade name over its corporate history 
the datamark trade name has significant market recognition and the company expects to derive benefits from the use of this asset beyond the foreseeable future 
however  should the company discontinue use of or otherwise determine that the value of the trade name is diminished  the company may be required to impair all or a significant portion of this asset 
pursuant to the datamark transaction  eight datamark employees signed agreements that legally restrict them from competing with ecollege during the employment period and for two years after the last date of employment  provided that the total restricted period may not exceed five years 
in determining the value of the non compete agreements  the company estimated the incremental sales associated with having the non compete agreements in place versus not having them in place 
the company is amortizing the fair value of the non compete agreements over five years 
certain factors that could affect the useful life of this asset include the termination of one or more of these employees  which could accelerate amortization if it would cause their non compete agreements to have lives of less than five years 
on march   the company announced that arthur benjamin  the chief executive officer of the enrollment division  had resigned from the company  as well as from datamark board of directors 
the amortization of the fair value of mr 
benjamin s non compete agreement will be accelerated beginning in to correspond with the resulting decrease in the term of the non compete 
goodwill and the identified intangible assets with indefinite and finite useful lives were not impaired at december  software development costs the company s activities include ongoing development of internal use software used in connection with delivery of services via its proprietary software platform and network 
pursuant to the provisions of the aicpa s statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and costs incurred during the preliminary project and post implementation stages are expensed as incurred 
capitalized software development costs are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  generally three years 
amortization begins when the products are ready for their intended use 
amortization expense for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
if the internal use software developed is determined to have a reduced life or is otherwise abandoned or impaired  amortization could be accelerated 
income taxes income taxes consist of federal  state and local taxes 
accounting for income taxes and any related valuation allowance requires the application of significant judgment and estimates 
we incurred significant losses from our inception through december  resulting in approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards  which expire in varying amounts beginning in however  utilization of such prospective net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to certain limitations  such as limitations resulting from significant changes in ownership 
in addition  income taxes may be payable during this time  due to operating income in certain tax jurisdictions which cannot be offset by operating loss carryforwards 
if we have taxable income and the net operating loss carryforwards are not available  because they have been limited by tax law  have been exhausted or have expired  we may be liable for significant taxes payable 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences  as determined pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  become deductible 
management considers the reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
management s evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets must consider both positive and negative evidence  and the weight given to the potential effects of positive and negative evidence is based on the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we had provided a full valuation allowance for the potential benefits of the aforementioned net operating loss carryforwards as we believed it was more likely than not that the benefits would not be realized 
during the fourth quarter of  we reversed million of the valuation allowance related to the net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary items as we believe it is now more likely than not that we will be able to use the assets to reduce future tax liabilities 
approximately  in valuation reserves associated with state net operating loss carryforwards were not reversed as it is more likely than not that the benefits of such carryforwards will not be realized 
the reversal resulted in recognition of an income tax benefit of million in and an increase in the deferred tax asset on the consolidated balance sheet 
the reversal also resulted in an increase of million to additional paid in capital associated with tax benefits from stock based compensation  and an increase of  to goodwill associated with certain tax benefits related to the datamark acquisition 
in future years  we expect to record income tax expense in relation to our pretax income 
description of significant components of our consolidated statement of operations revenue our revenue in primarily consisted of elearning student technology fees for students enrolled in online courses and online course supplements and revenues generated by direct mail and interactive marketing products and services provided by our enrollment division 
we also recognized a smaller portion of revenue from elearning online campus and course design and development services including licensing and hosting services fees for online campuses  and other elearning professional services as well as enrollment division media placement services  custom research  admissions training and student retention services 
cost of revenue cost of revenue for our elearning division consists primarily of employee compensation and benefits for our account management  online campus development  course design  technical personnel  and help desk departments as well as sales commissions 
our cost of revenue also includes software  hardware  and other direct costs associated with maintaining our data center operations  and our network infrastructure 
amortization of capitalized software development costs is also included in cost of revenue 
cost of revenue for our enrollment division includes postage costs  raw material costs  including paper and ink  costs for interactive marketing leads as well as all costs associated with the purchase license of mailing lists 
it also includes direct labor costs  allocable indirect labor and overhead and contract production costs 
gross profit as our product mix continues to change and diversify  the mix of our cost of revenue will change accordingly 
in  our revenue increased and our cost of revenue also increased as a percent of revenue  due to the inclusion of a full year of our enrollment division s operations 
datamark s gross margins have historically been lower than those of our elearning division 
product development product development includes costs of maintaining  developing  creating and improving our online solutions and software products 
these costs consist primarily of employee compensation and benefits  consulting fees  occupancy costs  and depreciation expenses 
product development costs in the future may be reduced by any software development costs that are capitalized in accordance with relevant accounting standards 
selling and marketing the principal components of our selling and marketing expenses in both divisions are employee compensation and benefits  advertising  industry conferences  and travel 
other significant components include marketing collaterals and direct mailings  consulting fees  occupancy costs  and depreciation expenses 
general and administrative we include costs from both divisions as well as unallocated corporate expenses in general and administrative expense 
these costs include executives  human resources  corporate facilities  corporate and divisional accounting and finance  legal  internal technical network administration and support and management information systems 
employee compensation and benefits  including stock based compensation  represent the most significant component of general and administrative expense 
other components include rent  depreciation  communications  insurance and professional and consulting fees  including fees related to the audit of our financial statements and our compliance with sarbanes oxley 
amortization of intangible assets our amortization of intangible assets consists entirely of the amortization of identified intangible assets that we recorded in connection with the datamark acquisition 
specifically  customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives of eight years and non compete agreements are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of five years 
on march   the company announced that arthur benjamin  the chief executive officer of the enrollment division  had resigned from the company  as well as from datamark s board of directors 
the amortization of the fair value of the related non compete agreement will be accelerated to correspond with the resulting decrease in the term of the non compete 
the datamark trade name has been deemed to have an indefinite life and is not subject to amortization expense 
other income expense  net other income expense  net consists primarily of interest expense associated with our various debt obligations 
it also includes interest income from invested cash and cash equivalents 
results of operations the following discussion compares the historical results of operations for the years ended december    and the results for include the enrollment division s results of operations from october   the date on which we acquired all of the outstanding stock of datamark  inc the inclusion of the enrollment division s results for and the two months ended december  caused significant fluctuations in the operating results of ecollege for the years shown 
years ended december  and revenue 
revenue increased million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the enrollment division was responsible for million of this increase  primarily from inclusion of a full year s operating results  as compared to two months in the remaining million of the increase in revenue is primarily due to million increase in student fees from online courses partially offset by a million decrease in other elearning revenue 
student fees represented million and million of total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of 
our elearning customers benefit from volume discounts on their student technology fees based on the success of their distance programs 
in addition  they often guarantee a minimum amount of student technology fees for each year they are under contract with us  for which they receive further discounts on our services 
therefore  the increase in our student fee revenue was not directly proportional to the increase in our customers online student enrollments in student enrollments in ecourses increased to  in from  in the prior year  while the corresponding revenue earned from ecourse enrollments increased to million in from million in the and enrollment numbers are not directly comparable because includes approximately  enrollments in short term faculty training courses that generated significantly less revenue per enrollment than other ecourses offered 
we expect the trend of enrollment growth outpacing revenue growth to continue in revenue from direct mail marketing activities at our enrollment division was million for the year ended december   an increase of million from the two months of enrollment division operations included in direct mail accounted for of total enrollment division revenue we recognized in compared to of enrollment division revenue in the two months included in operations in revenue from interactive marketing services increased to million in from  in the two months of operations included in the year ended december  this increase in interactive marketing revenue was the primary reason for the decrease in direct mail revenue as a percentage of enrollment division total revenue  as interactive marketing revenue growth exceeded direct mail revenue growth in campus and course development fees represented million and million of total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of million or 
we recognized revenue from developing  licensing  and hosting online campuses for customers during  down from the customers that had online campuses in the decrease results from an increasing number of customers taking advantage of our tools by self designing and developing their own courses 
other revenue included elearning technical and instructional design consulting revenue of million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
it also included million from media placement activities from our enrollment division in the year ended december  compared to  in cost of revenue 
cost of revenue for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the enrollment division s direct mail and other cost of revenue was million in  an increase of million from million for the two months of operations included in elearning division cost of revenue decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million in this decrease is attributable to a million decrease in amortization expense related to our capitalized software costs 
gross profit 
we realized gross profit of million for the year ended december   resulting in a or million increase compared to the million we realized in the enrollment division contributed million to our gross profit for  up from million in  while the elearning division contributed million for  up from million in the increase of million related to the enrollment division was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of operations in as compared to two months in  while the million increase related to the elearning division was primarily due to the increase in our higher margin student fee revenue 
product development 
product development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase was primarily attributable to increased staffing including offshore developers and travel expenses related to our sri lanka development facility 
we capitalized million in costs for internally developed software in  which reduced research and development expense by a corresponding amount 
in  we capitalized  in costs for internally developed software 
no such costs were capitalized in selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the enrollment division recorded million of selling and marketing expenses during  an increase of million from  reflecting a full year of expense in as compared to two months in the elearning division had million of selling and marketing expenses in  a decrease of  from  primarily due to a decrease in the number of sales and marketing personnel in and the expiration of a prepaid marketing contract 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  of this increase  million related to a full year of operations for the enrollment division in million  as compared to two months in 
other factors contributing to the increase in from included increases in general corporate expenses such as bonuses million  sarbanes oxley compliance million  audit fees and higher stock based compensation 
these increased costs were offset somewhat by a decrease in information systems costs 
we record non cash stock based compensation in connection with the grant of stock options  stock awards under our employee stock purchase plan  stock appreciation rights and restricted share rights to employees  officers  and directors in accordance with sfas which we adopted using the prospective method  effective january  the deferred charges are being amortized over the relevant vesting periods of such options or restricted share rights  which range from one to five years 
we recorded million of stock based compensation in the year ended december  a portion of such compensation expense was allocated to cost of revenue  selling and marketing expense  and product development expense  as appropriate  based on the recipients of the awards  however the majority of the stock based compensation expense relates to our executive team and was therefore included in general and administrative expense 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets for the year ended december  was million compared to million in the increase was due to twelve months of amortization in compared to two months in amortization of intangible assets consists entirely of the amortization of identified intangible assets which we recorded in connection with the datamark acquisition 
specifically  customer relationships with an estimated value of million are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of eight years  and non compete agreements valued at million are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of five years 
on march   the company announced that arthur benjamin  the chief executive officer of the enrollment division  had resigned from the company as well as from datamark s board of directors 
the amortization of the fair value of the related non compete agreement will be accelerated to corespond with the resulting decrease in the term of the non compete 
other income expense 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the majority of the increase is related to a full year of interest expense on the debt obligations incurred to fund the acquisition of datamark in october  included in interest expense for the year ended december  was million in expense from early repayment of million million face value in seller notes issued as a part of the datamark acquisition 
included in interest expense for the year ended december  was approximately  of foregone debt issuance costs incurred in september  to establish a financing commitment to fund the datamark acquisition 
prior to the consummation of the datamark acquisition  we were able to negotiate debt on more favorable terms with different lenders  therefore all of these costs were expensed during income taxes 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  due to the reversal of the valuation allowance we had previously recorded against our deferred tax asset as well as from the recognition of changes in other temporary differences 
we had  in cash expenditures for income taxes in we determined in that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the tax benefits of our approximately million in net operating losses as a carryforward against future taxable income 
we had no income tax expense or benefit in net income 
our net income increased to million or per basic and per diluted share for the year ended december   from a net income of  or per basic and diluted share in years ended december  and revenue 
revenue increased million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the new enrollment division was responsible for million of this increase  primarily from the direct mail marketing services completed in november and december which accounted for million 
the remaining million of the increase in revenue is primarily due to million increase in student fees from online courses and an increase in other revenue of million  offset by decline in campus and course fees of million 
total student fees represented million and million of total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of 
our elearning customers benefit from volume discounts on their student technology fees based on the success of their distance programs 
in addition  they often guarantee a minimum amount of student technology fees for each year they are under contract with us  for which they receive further discounts on our services 
therefore  the increase in our student fee revenue was not directly proportional to the increase in our customers online student enrollments in student enrollments in ecourses increased to  in from  in the prior year  while the corresponding revenue earned from distance enrollments increased to million in from million in student enrollments in our lower priced ecompanion course supplements increased to  in from  in the prior year while total revenue recognized from such supplements increased during to million from million in  due primarily to our pricing strategy 
campus and course fees represented million and million of total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of million or 
we recognized revenue from developing  licensing  and hosting online campuses for different customers during  down from the customers that had online campuses in the decrease results from an increasing number of customers taking advantage of our tools by self designing and developing their own courses 
other revenue includes elearning technical and instructional design consulting revenue of  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
it also includes million of other revenue from our enrollment division  including  from interactive marketing services and  from media placement activities 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue for the year ended december  increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  the newly acquired enrollment division increased direct mail and other cost of revenue in by million 
student fees  campus and course fees and other cost of revenue decreased by  or to million for the year ended december  this decrease is mainly attributable to a savings of  of depreciation expense primarily related to our internal technology cost of sales departments  commission expense of  and decreased nist costs of  offsetting these savings were increased salaries and related benefits of  and increased system costs of  amortization expense related to our capitalized software costs for both of the years ended december  and was million

we realized gross profit of million  resulting in a or million increase for the year ended december  compared to the million we realized in the new enrollment division contributed million to our gross profit for  while the elearning division contributed the favorable increase of million related to the elearning division was primarily due to the increase in our student fees  which have a relatively higher contribution margin than most of our other revenue sources due to the realization of operating leverage on the generally fixed nature of our data center expenses 
product development 
product development expenses remained flat at million for both the years ended december  and the enrollment division did not incur expenses related to product development during the period of our ownership in the elearning division recognized savings in rent  consulting  maintenance and depreciation expenses of approximately  savings related to severance payments made to an executive during offset increases to salaries and benefits related to additional staff personnel  netting to a savings of  offsetting these savings were increases in travel and office expenses of selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased by  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the enrollment division recorded  of selling and marketing expenses during the two months ended december   therefore accounting for the entire increase on a consolidated basis 
for the elearning division  selling and marketing expenses decreased to million in the decrease was partially due to reduced expenses related to conferences  advertising  and promotion costs of  which were somewhat offset by increased collateral costs of  as we focused on more activities directed at key decision makers within our target markets 
our elearning division marketing personnel costs remained consistent during and we had decreases in rent and depreciation expense associated with our sales and marketing groups of  from the same period last year 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased million or to million in from million in  of the increase related to the newly acquired enrollment division 
additional factors contributing to the increase during included increases in general corporate expenses such as franchise and personal property taxes  tax consulting  audit  and legal expenses of  as well as higher costs related to executive compensation and benefits including stock based compensation 
we also incurred approximately  of expenses specifically associated with the datamark acquisition 
these increased costs were offset somewhat by decreases in travel and depreciation expenses of  our facilities costs decreased in since we incurred  of one time expenses related to our corporate headquarters move during the year ended december  we record stock based compensation in connection with the grant of stock options  stock awards under our employee stock purchase plan and restricted share rights to employees  officers  and directors in accordance with sfas no 
 which we adopted using the prospective method effective january  the deferred charge is being amortized over the relevant vesting periods of such options or restricted share rights  which range from to years 
we recorded million of stock based compensation in the year ended december   of which approximately  was directly related to our adoption of sfas no 
using the prospective method 
since we had previously accounted for our employee stock based awards in accordance with apb no 
 only  of stock based compensation was recorded in the year ended december  a portion of such compensation expense was allocated to cost of revenue  selling and marketing expense  and product development expense  as appropriate  based on the recipients of the awards however  the majority of the stock based compensation expense relates to our executive team and was therefore included in general and administrative expense 
amortization of intangible assets 
our amortization of intangible assets of million consists entirely of the amortization of our identified intangible assets which we recorded in connection with the datamark acquisition 
specifically  customer relationships with an estimated value of million are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of years  and non compete agreements valued at million are being amortized over their estimated useful life of years 
on march   the company announced that arthur benjamin  the chief executive officer of the enrollment division  had resigned from the company  as well as from datamark s board of directors 
the amortization of the fair value of the related non compete agreement will be accelerated to correspond with the resulting decrease in the term of the non compete 
other income expense 
our interest and other income  which consists primarily of interest earnings on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments decreased by  to  for the year ended december  interest expense increased by million  the majority of which related to the debt obligations incurred to fund the acquisition of datamark  on october  included in interest expense for the year ended december  was approximately  of foregone debt issuance costs that were incurred in september  these costs were originally incurred to establish a financing commitment from a lender to fund the datamark acquisition 
however  prior to the consummation of the datamark acquisition  we were able to negotiate debt on more favorable terms with different lenders  therefore all of these costs were expensed during income taxes 
we recorded no provision or benefit for federal or state income taxes during the year ended december  as we believe any tax liability incurred during this period would be offset by the benefit of our net operating loss carryforwards and we had not yet determined that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset associated with the net operating loss carryforwards would be realizable 
net income 
our net income increased to  or per basic and diluted share for the year ended december  from a net loss of million or per basic and diluted share in segment information the two reportable segments disclosed in this document are based on our management organizational structure as of december  a detailed description of the products and services  as well as financial data  for each segment can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
please note that based on the way in which our management team reviews and evaluates segment performance  the segment operating results shown below for  and do not include amortization of intangible assets  interest income  interest expense and other income expense 
in addition  the segment operating results for do not include non allocated corporate expenses 
such items are only considered when evaluating the results of the consolidated company 
future changes to this organizational structure may result in changes to the reportable segments disclosed 
historical results the historical results and discussions below include the historical results of each of ecollege s segments in fiscal   and  including datamark s results of operations from october  the acquisition date 
elearning division net revenue income loss from operations income loss from operations as a percentage of net revenue elearning revenue grew in and in from the prior year 
the increase in revenue for both years is primarily due to an increase in the number of student enrollments in online courses 
from our inception through december   the majority of our revenue was generated by development and design services fees for building online campuses and courses  and  to a lesser extent  student fees 
however  student fees represented million  million  and million of total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively  which translates into increases of in and in student fees have become the majority of our total elearning revenue as the number of online courses offered by our customers and the number of students enrolled in those courses delivered on our course management platform continues to increase while the revenue generated by our online campus and course development services has declined 
as previously mentioned  our student fee revenue growth has been outpaced by the growth in enrollments on the ecollege system due to various pricing programs that we offer to benefit customers with large online distance programs 
we expect these trends in our revenue mix and growth to continue in our customers offer traditional  as well as quarterly  bi monthly and monthly course terms to their students and we typically host more courses during the spring academic term than in the summer or fall terms 
as a result  consecutive academic term enrollment results are not directly comparable 
the following table presents the number of student enrollments our customers had start in distance courses during the   and spring  summer  and fall academic terms 
distance course enrollments academic term spring january may summer may august fall august december total student enrollments for a more detailed explanation of revenue components and the growth trends of the elearning division revenue  please see the information under the caption results of operations earlier in this item income loss from operations increased by million between and the favorable increase was primarily due to an increase in our elearning student fees  which have a relatively higher contribution margin than most of our other revenue sources and by the exclusion of non allocable corporate general and administrative expenses from segment results in in and  elearning results include these corporate expenses  as the elearning division was the only reporting segment for ecollege in and the enrollment division had only two months of operations in enrollment division year ended december  in thousands  except percentage net revenue income loss from operations income loss from operations as a percentage of net revenue as datamark was acquired on october   the preceding results only show activity for the full year of and the last two months of during the ten months ended october  prior to our acquisition of datamark  datamark s revenue was million and income from operations was million 
therefore  on a pro forma basis for the entire year of  datamark s revenue was million and income from operations was million of net revenue 
for a more detailed explanation of revenue components and operating results of the enrollment division  please see the information under the caption results of operations earlier in this item liquidity and capital resources the company s cash and cash equivalents decreased by million from million at december   to million at december  balances at december  reflect cash from draws on our line of credit of million 
such draws were made to demonstrate the availability of the funds in and were repaid in january of the decrease in total cash and cash equivalents from december  to december  was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of million offset by cash used in financing activities of million and net cash used in investing activities of million 
major cash uses for financing activities included repayment of the million in draws against our revolver outstanding at december   repayment of million million face value in seller notes and repayment of million of principal on our term loan 
these uses were partially offset by proceeds from option exercises in the amount of million 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  included purchases of property and equipment of million and capitalized internal use software costs of million 
included in the cash provided by operations for the year ended december  were adjustments to net income of million for depreciation and million for amortization expenses of capitalized software and intangible assets 
under the terms of the stock purchase agreement for the datamark acquisition  the purchase price was to be adjusted based upon datamark s working capital at the date of completion of the transaction 
ecollege and the former datamark stockholders agreed that million of the cash consideration paid by ecollege would be put into a working capital escrow until the final purchase price was determined 
as a result  at december   the company recorded million as due from former datamark stockholders on the consolidated balance sheet  of which million of cash was in escrow and  was owed by the former datamark stockholders 
during the fourth quarter of  the company and the former datamark stockholders reached agreement concerning the purchase price 
under the terms of the agreement  the company was entitled to receive the million in escrow as well as  of the  owed by the former datamark stockholders 
the remaining  was recorded during as an increase to goodwill 
under the terms of the agreement  the company agreed to pay the former datamark stockholders  in federal and state tax refunds associated with returns filed subsequent to the acquisition 
as of december    of this liability remains to be paid as the related refunds had not yet been received 
pursuant to the stock purchase agreement  datamark s former stockholders were required to indemnify ecollege 
as security for the indemnification obligations  million of the cash paid in the acquisition was placed in escrow 
in addition  ecollege has the right to offset the remaining balance owed under the seller notes for indemnified claims 
in  ecollege received  from the indemnification escrow in satisfaction of various claims 
ecollege has also submitted a claim for liabilities  if any  arising in connection with the utah sales and use tax dispute described in item of this annual report of form k 
issuance of equity securities we have financed the majority of our operations through the issuance of equity securities 
we used the net proceeds from equity financings for funding capital expenditures  supporting sales  marketing and product development activities  expanding our data centers  enhancing financial information systems  and funding other expenses associated with our growth  including partial funding of the datamark acquisition in borrowings the company obtained a million term loan term loan with a bank in october the term loan refinanced a previous term loan and the outstanding debt on an equipment financing facility 
the term loan has an interest rate of per annum and is being repaid in equal installments which began in november at december   the company had million outstanding under this loan 
the company incurred approximately  in debt issuance costs in connection with obtaining this loan 
these debt issuance costs were deferred and are being amortized as interest expense over the three year term of the loan 
the term loan contains certain financial covenants  including requirements that the company maintain a specified minimum ratio of quick assets to current liabilities  minimum tangible net worth  minimum debt service coverage and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the term loan is secured by all the company s assets 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants contained in the term loan as of december  the term loan was repaid in full during march  as a part of the master debt agreement with the bank that provided the term loan  the company also obtained a million revolving line of credit  the revolver which will mature on october   and which replaced a previous revolving line of credit 
the interest rate on the revolver is equal to the bank s prime rate  which was at december   plus  but at no time will it be less than 
the revolver contains the same covenants as the term loan and is secured by all of the company s assets 
the revolver contains a cross default provision with the term loan 
maximum amounts outstanding under the revolver are limited to the company s borrowing base  which is calculated primarily based on aged accounts receivable 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants of the revolver as of december  the company drew million from its revolving line of credit in december  and million in each of march  june and september  under the revolver 
each draw was repaid in the month following the draw 
in october  the company issued million in senior subordinated notes to a lender 
the senior subordinated notes have principal payments due in million quarterly increments beginning december   with interest payments due quarterly beginning december   at a rate of per annum 
the senior subordinated notes have certain financial covenants  including minimum quick ratio  minimum tangible net worth  minimum debt service coverage  and minimum ebitda  and are secured by all the company s assets 
the senior subordinated notes also contain a cross default provision with the company s bank debt 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants of the senior subordinated notes as of december  in connection with the issuance of the senior subordinated notes  the company issued warrants to the lender to purchase  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
however  if at the time of exercise of all or any portion of the warrants  the trading price of the company s common stock is less than per share for the thirty trading days immediately preceding the date of such exercise  then the exercise price shall be automatically adjusted such that the exercise price will be equal to per share with respect to such exercise 
as of december  the exercise price had adjusted to per share 
the warrants expire on october  the net proceeds received in connection with the issuance of the senior subordinated notes totaled million  which was allocated to the senior subordinated notes and the warrants 
the company allocated million to the warrants based upon the fair value of the warrants  which was estimated using the black scholes option pricing model  a risk free interest rate of  volatility of  dividend yield  and an expected life of five years the contractual life 
the remaining million was allocated to the senior subordinated notes 
the debt discount attributable to the value of the warrants is being amortized as interest expense over the five year term of the senior subordinated notes using the interest method 
the company also incurred approximately million in debt issuance costs in connection with the senior subordinated notes 
the debt issuance costs were deferred and are being amortized as interest expense over the five year term of the senior subordinated notes 
the effective interest rate on the senior subordinated notes  including the amortization of the warrant and debt issuance costs  is 
the senior subordinated notes also contain a provision that provides for the acceleration of all interest payments due through october  upon early extinguishment of the debt prior to october  also in connection with the acquisition of datamark in october  the company issued seller notes totaling million to the selling stockholders 
the seller notes  with interest and principal due in  were comprised of a series of notes issued to the selling stockholders  aggregating to million face amount  which bear simple interest at a rate of per annum and another series of notes  aggregating to million face amount  which bear simple interest at a rate of  compounded annually 
all of the simple interest notes  as well as million face amount of the annually compounding notes were repaid in the company recorded million for the seller notes at the time of their issuance based upon their estimated fair value  resulting in a discount in the original amount of million  which is being amortized over the term of the debt using the interest method 
the effective interest rate on these notes  including the amortization of the recorded discount  is 
the fair value of the seller notes was determined by a third party who considered  among other factors  the effective interest rate of the senior subordinated notes  and other comparable debt securities 
due to the discounts on the senior subordinated notes and seller notes  any payment of these debt obligations prior to their maturity results in additional interest expense due to the realization of the unamortized portions of the costs and discounts recorded 
the early repayment of million carrying value million face value of seller notes during the fourth quarter of resulted in an additional million interest charge 
the remaining balance of the seller notes was million at december   with an unamortized discount of  and accrued interest payable of we expect our current cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  together with cash generated from operations  to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes  as of december   our obligations to make future payments under current contracts in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt including current portion capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase commitments consulting agreement total amounts represent the expected cash payments of the stated face value of principal on our debt as well as interest payments 
the company leases office space and equipment under various non cancelable operating leases 
ecollege entered into an agreement with a third party vendor in january  to provide supplemental software development for our development projects 
minimum commitments under this contract aggregated million at december  if ecollege terminates the agreement prior to april   it will be required to pay a termination penalty equal to six months expense at the then current minimum staffing level 
in conjunction with the datamark acquisition  we entered into a five year consulting agreement with leeds equity advisors inc  of which jonathan newcomb  a former director  was a principal 
payments under this agreement aggregate  per year  plus expenses 
the agreement continues for four additional years at  per year  plus expenses 
rent expense for the years ended december    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas sfas r supersedes apb no 
 and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative following the adoption of sfas r 
the company is in the process of evaluating the impact of sfas r on its consolidated financial statements 
sfas r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
the company plans to adopt sfas r using the modified prospective method on july  risk factors this section identifies certain risks and uncertainties that we face 
if we are unable to appropriately address these and other circumstances that could have a negative effect on our business  our business may suffer 
negative events may decrease our revenues  increase our costs  negatively affect our financial results and decrease our financial strength  thereby causing our stock price to decline 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks not presently known to us or other factors not perceived by us to present significant risks to our business at this time also may have a negative impact on our business 
we face significant competition in our markets 
the online learning market has evolved quickly over the past ten years and is subject to technological change 
some colleges and universities construct online learning systems using in house personnel and create their own software or purchase software components from a vendor 
therefore we face significant competition from a variety of entities including software companies with specific products for the college and university market and service companies that specialize in consulting  system integration and support in the elearning industry 
other competitors in this market include a wide range of education and training providers using video  mail correspondence  cd rom  and live online training 
we also face significant competition in the market for enrollment marketing services to the post secondary education industry 
competition is most intense from colleges and universities that perform their own enrollment marketing services in house 
datamark also faces competition from other enrollment marketing companies  direct marketing companies  media placement agencies and online marketing companies 
some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  larger customer bases  greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
certain competitors may be able to secure alliances with customers and affiliates on more favorable terms  devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns and devote substantially more resources to systems development than we can 
in addition  it is possible that certain competitors  or potential competitors  could reduce their pricing to levels that would make it difficult for us to compete 
increased competition may result in reduced operating margins  as well as loss of market share and brand recognition 
in addition  in order to compete effectively in our markets  we may need to change our business in significant ways 
for example  we may change our pricing  product  or service offerings  make key decisions about technology directions or marketing strategies  or acquire additional businesses or technologies 
any of these actions could hurt our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
recent rapid growth in our markets may not continue and our ability to grow may be adversely affected 
the online learning market and the for profit post secondary education market have grown rapidly in recent years  and there can be no assurance that such growth levels will continue 
our ability to execute our growth strategy will depend in part on continued growth in these markets 
with respect to the online learning market  our success will depend in part on the continued adoption by our customers and potential customers of online education initiatives 
online education is a relatively new development  and some academics and educators are opposed to it in principle 
it is possible that their opposition could reduce the demand for our products and services or result in increased costs or burdens for customers and potential customers offering online education 
with respect to our enrollment marketing services  the marketing strategies and budgets of our current and prospective are subject to frequent change for a variety of reasons 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated from a relatively small number of customers 
revenue from a small number of customers has comprised a substantial portion of the historical revenue of elearning and datamark and is expected to represent a substantial portion of divisional revenue for the foreseeable future 
for the year ended december   our largest elearning customers accounted for of elearning division revenue and the largest customers of the enrollment division accounted for of enrollment division revenue 
one institution corinthian colleges that is a customer of both the elearning and enrollment divisions accounted for approximately of consolidated revenue in  and one other customer of the enrollment division career education corporation accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue in any cancellation  deferral  or significant reduction in work performed for these principal customers  or failure to collect accounts receivable from these principal customers  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our network infrastructure and computer systems may fail 
the continuing and uninterrupted performance of our network infrastructure and computer systems is critical to our success 
any system failure that causes interruptions in our ability to provide services could reduce customer satisfaction and  if sustained or repeated  would reduce the attractiveness of our technology and services to our customers and their students and prospective customers 
because our services involve the storage and transmission of proprietary and confidential customer and student information our success depends on our ability to provide superior network security protection and the confidence of our customers in that ability 
unauthorized disclosure of such information could subject us to liability and have a negative impact on our reputation 
our system is designed to prevent unauthorized access from the internet and  to date  our operations have not been affected by security breaks  nevertheless  in the future we may not be able to prevent unauthorized disruptions of our network operations  whether caused unintentionally or by computer hackers or by the failure of our internet service providers to provide us with adequate bandwidth and service 
despite precautions we have taken  unanticipated problems affecting our systems have from time to time in the past caused  and in the future could cause  interruptions or delays in the delivery of our products and services 
any damage or failure that interrupts or delays our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
we are almost exclusively dependent on microsoft for our underlying software technology platform 
we are therefore potentially vulnerable to business or operational disruption caused by changes in the microsoft platform  security flaws in microsoft software  and or potential price increases or licensing changes by microsoft 
we have incurred debt  which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to obtain financing in the future and react to changes in our business 
as of december   the company s principal debt obligations totaled approximately million million face value 
of this amount  million million face value is secured by all of our assets 
our debt could have important consequences to our stockholders 
because of our substantial debt our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes  or other purposes may be impaired in the future  a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes  we may be exposed to increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest  and our flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions and ability to withstand competitive pressures could be limited  and we may be more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions or our business or be unable to carry out capital spending that is necessary or important to our growth strategy and productivity improvement programs 
the breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in our term loan  senior subordinated notes  seller notes or revolver could result in a cross default under the applicable agreements which would permit the applicable lenders to declare all amounts then outstanding to be due and payable  together with accrued and unpaid interest  and  in the case of the term loan  senior subordinated notes and revolver  to foreclose on our assets 
in any such case  we may be unable to make any borrowings under our revolver and may not be able to repay the amounts due under our term loan  senior subordinated notes  or seller notes 
this could have serious consequences to our financial condition and results of operations and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent 
our stock price is likely to be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to factors such as the following  some of which are beyond our control quarterly variations in our operating results  operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  changes in market valuations of other online service companies or our customers  future sales of our common stock  stock market price and volume fluctuations  general political and economic conditions  such as a recession  war or terrorist attacks or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations  and other risk factors discussed in this report 
these factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the market prices for stocks of many internet related and technology companies have historically experienced extreme price fluctuations that appeared to bear no relationship to the operating performance of these companies 
in the event our stock price fell significantly  investors might sue the company  causing increased litigation expenses and  possibly  the payment of large damages or settlement fees 
if we undertake future acquisitions  we may not effectively manage their integration into ecollege 
a key element of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions 
if we make an acquisition  we may have difficulty integrating the acquired business into ecollege 
our ability to realize the expected benefits of any acquisition will require  among other things  the following retention and relationship management of existing customers of both companies  retention of strategic partners of each company  minimization of disruption of each company s ongoing business and distraction of its management  integration of the two companies information and software systems and other operations  developing and maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures  and policies  including internal controls  and limiting expenses related to integration 
we may not succeed in addressing these integration risks or other problems or liabilities that we may encounter in connection with an acquisition  including the creation of a variety of accounting charges which could increase our reported expenses  including impairment of goodwill and the write off of acquired intangible assets  diminishing the value of our brands or reputation if an acquired company turns out to be a poor performer  and the assumption of most or all of the liabilities of the acquired companies  some of which may be hidden  significant  or otherwise not reflected in the final acquisition price 
if the benefits of the acquisition do not exceed the associated costs  including costs associated with integrating the two companies  our financial results  including earnings per share and stock price  could be materially adversely affected 
certain aspects of the datamark acquisition could negatively impact our financial results 
certain aspects of the datamark acquisition could negatively impact our financial results 
we recorded a significant portion of the approximate million purchase price as goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
intangible assets resulting from acquisitions require significant judgment in terms of establishing their fair value  determining appropriate amortization periods  and assessing such intangibles  including goodwill  for impairment in the future 
it is possible that our review of such intangible assets in the future could determine that they are impaired and the amount of such impairment could be significant 
we recorded approximately million of the purchase price as identifiable intangible assets  which will cause us to record additional non cash amortization expense in the future and which will also be reviewed periodically for impairment in the future 
an impairment charge could be material  if it is determined that an impairment of the assets has occurred 
we are also incurring interest expense related to the fair value of the warrants issued in connection with the senior subordinated notes and the discount to fair value of the seller notes 
we also have increased cash interest expense due to the debt we incurred to finance the acquisition  and will be required to repay the face amount of these debt instruments million as of december  upon their maturity 
all of these additional expenses and cash outflows could negatively impact our financial results  financial position  and liquidity 
we may desire or need to raise additional capital in the future and it may not be available on acceptable terms 
we may desire or need to raise additional capital through public or private financing  strategic relationships  or other arrangements in the future 
in the event that we desire or need to raise additional capital  we cannot assure that additional funds will be available or that funds will be available on terms favorable to us 
furthermore  we may have to sell stock at prices lower than those paid by existing stockholders  which would result in dilution to those stockholders  or we may have to sell stock or bonds with rights superior to rights of holders of common stock 
any debt financing might involve restrictive covenants that could limit our operating flexibility 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or enhance our services and products  take advantage of future opportunities  or respond to competitive pressures  which could have an adverse effect on our business and our financial position 
any future need to raise additional funds could also directly and adversely affect our stockholders investment in our common stock 
we depend on our customers and third parties to market student enrollments for online courses 
a substantial portion of our elearning division revenue is derived from fees for each enrollment in an online course that we host for our customers 
generally  we do not market directly to students to generate enrollments in our customers courses and therefore have little influence on the number of students that enroll 
we are therefore dependent on the institutions and organizations that purchase our products and services to market to individual students 
the failure of these third parties to effectively attract  maintain  and increase student enrollments could affect our revenue growth and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
although datamark provides enrollment marketing services for its customers  the majority of datamark s customers are not customers of our elearning division  and there can be no assurance that they will become customers of our elearning division 
we depend on our key personnel 
our success depends on the performance of our key management  technical  sales and other critical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract  motivate and retain management and highly qualified key personnel 
failure to do so could disrupt our operations  adversely affect our customer relationships and impair our ability to successfully implement and complete company initiatives 
we are facing increased labor costs  particularly with respect to technical personnel  if this trend continues  we may be required to pay higher compensation to attract qualified personnel and our results of operations may be adversely affected 
key personnel have left the company over the years  and there may be additional departures of key personnel from time to time 
on march   arthur benjamin resigned as executive vice president of ecollege and chairman and chief executive officer of the enrollment division 
during his tenure at datamark  mr 
benjamin developed significant customer relationships  and ecollege intends to maintain those relationships in the future 
there can be no assurance  however  that mr 
benjamin s departure will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future success and our ability to pursue our growth strategy will depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our senior management personnel 
although we have employment agreements with our executive officers  these agreements do not obligate them to remain employed by us 
the loss of services of any senior management personnel could make it more difficult for us to successfully pursue our business goals 
we may be unable to sustain profitability 
although we have reported net income for each of the previous seven fiscal quarters ending december   and datamark  under its previous owners and structure  had realized net income for each reporting period since  there can be no guarantee that we will be able to sustain profitability 
we believe that our success depends  among other things  on our ability to increase our revenue by further developing existing customer relationships and developing new relationships with colleges  universities  and other potential customers without increasing our expenses at the same rate 
if we are unable to continue to increase our revenue  our business and financial results will be materially and adversely affected 
our internal control over financial reporting may not be considered effective  which could result in possible regulatory sanctions and a decline in our stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to furnish annually a report on our internal control over financial reporting  beginning with this annual report on form k 
the internal control report must contain an assessment by our management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting including the disclosure of any material weakness and a statement that our independent auditors have attested to and reported on management s evaluation of such internal controls 
the sarbanes oxley act requires  among other things  that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 
in order for management to evaluate our internal controls  we must regularly review and document our internal control processes and procedures and test such controls 
ultimately  we or our independent auditors could conclude that our internal control over financial reporting may not be effective if  among other things any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting exists  or we fail to remediate assessed deficiencies 
as of the date hereof  we have identified several internal control deficiencies that existed as of december  and that we believe will be considered material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
as a result  we believe that  when assessing our internal control over financial reporting  neither management nor our independent auditors will be able to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting was effective within the meaning of section of sarbanes oxley as of december  for further discussion of these internal control deficiencies and our remediation efforts  see item a controls and procedures 
if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of december   we could be subject to regulatory sanctions or lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  either of which could have an adverse effect on the market price for our securities 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and we may be subject to claims of infringement by third parties 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary rights and technology  such as our trade and product names  and the proprietary software included in our products 
we rely on a combination of copyrights  trademarks  servicemarks  patents  trade secret laws  and employee and third party nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary rights 
despite our efforts to protect these rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to duplicate or copy aspects of our services or software or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
if others infringe or misappropriate our copyrights  servicemarks or other proprietary rights  our business could be hurt 
in addition  the laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
our failure to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
in addition  although we do not believe that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others  other parties might assert infringement claims against us 
we may encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property 
these disputes  even if without merit  could lead to litigation  which may be time consuming and costly even if we are successful  may require us to redesign our products or services  may require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all  and could be a distraction to management  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  our agreements with our customers require us to indemnify our customers in the event they are sued by a third party claiming that our products and services infringe a third party s intellectual property rights 
in the event of such a lawsuit against our customers  our performance of these indemnification obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
government regulation may adversely affect our future operating results 
the federal government  through the higher education act and other legislation  may consider changes in the laws that affect distance education in higher education 
legislation could be adopted that would have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  it is possible that laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet  relating to user privacy  content  taxation  intellectual property ownership and infringement  distribution  and characteristics and quality of products and services 
the adoption of any additional laws or regulations may decrease the popularity or expansion of online education  and may cause us to incur unanticipated compliance costs 
the adoption of federal or state laws or regulations concerning privacy of personal information could impair datamark s ability to purchase lists of prospective students from third party vendors or increase the costs of obtaining such lists 
our increasing presence in many states across the country may subject us to additional tax laws and government regulations  which may adversely affect our future operating results 
our violation of any state statutes  laws or other regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
we cannot predict the impact  if any  that future regulation or regulatory changes may have on our business 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly and may be below the expectations of analysts and investors 
the sales cycle for our products and services vary widely and can be very lengthy  particularly for the elearning division 
because of the variability and length of the sales cycle  it may be difficult for us to predict the timing of particular sales  the rate at which online campuses  courses  and or course supplements will be implemented  the number of students who will enroll in the online courses  or the rate of which new or future customers will utilize our enrollment marketing services 
because a significant portion of our elearning division s costs are fixed and are based on anticipated revenue levels  small variations in the timing of revenue recognition could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
since we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall  any significant decrease in revenue would likely have an immediate material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
additionally  our operating expenses may fluctuate due to changes in accounting standards and or our elected accounting policies 
further  any such variations could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in such an event  the trading price of our stock would likely fall and investors might sue the company  causing increased litigation expenses and  possibly  the payment of large damages or settlement fees 
datamark does not have long term agreements with its customers and may be unable to retain customers  attract new customers or replace departing customers with customers that can provide comparable revenues 
most of datamark s contracts with its customers are short term 
datamark s current customers may not continue to use its products and services  datamark may not be able to replace in a timely or effective manner departing customers with new customers that generate comparable revenues  and datamark may not continue to increase its customer base 
further  there can be no assurance that datamark s customers will continue to generate consistent amounts of revenues over time 
datamark s failure to develop and sustain long term relationships with its customers could materially and adversely affect the results of operations of datamark and ecollege as a whole 
if we are unable to continue to receive our current level of access to and costs for mailing lists  our competitive advantage could be materially affected 
our enrollment division obtains mailing lists from third party vendors 
because of our unique relationships with some of our key vendors  we are able to purchase these lists in high volumes under favorable pricing and in an efficient format 
if we were unable to continue to obtain these mailing lists at our current pricing levels  and in the format in which we historically have received these lists  it could reduce our competitive advantage and have a material adverse effect on our business 
increases in costs of revenue could harm datamark s business 
the direct marketing activities of datamark may be adversely affected by increases in certain costs 
datamark s direct mail activities may be adversely affected by postal rate increases  especially increases that are imposed without sufficient advance notice to allow adjustments to be made to marketing budgets 
with regards to datamark s interactive marketing services  rising demand for online advertising has in the past and may in the future cause internet media prices to increases 
because datamark is generally obligated under its contracts to deliver a specified number of leads at a specified price  datamark may be unable to adjust its pricing to reflect increased internet lead costs until contracts expire and are renegotiated 
any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect the business  financial condition and results of operations of datamark and ecollege as a whole 
our operating margins may suffer if our enrollment marketing revenues increase as a percentage of total revenues because our enrollment marketing revenues have lower margins 
because our enrollment division revenues typically have lower margins than the revenues from our elearning division  an increase in the percentage of total revenues represented by enrollment marketing revenues could have a detrimental impact on our overall margins and could adversely affect our operating results 
our business and future operating results are subject to a broad range of uncertainties arising out of terrorist attacks on the united states of america 
our business and operating results are subject to uncertainties arising out of terrorist attacks on the united states of america 
these uncertainties include the potential worsening or extension of the global economic slowdown and the economic consequences of military action or additional terrorist activities 
while terrorist attacks have not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  any future attacks or events arising as a result of the attacks  such as interruptions to the international telecommunications network or the internet  could have a material impact on our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  operating results  or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
the company is  or may become  exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the united states dollar 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
historically  and as of december   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
additionally  the company does not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on invested cash  which was million at december  historically we have invested available cash in money market accounts  certificates of deposit  and investment grade commercial paper that generally had maturities of three months or less  as well as debt securities of united states government agencies and corporate bonds 
our short term investment portfolio is managed in accordance with our investment policy 
the company s investment policy requires that its investment portfolio be limited to investment securities of less than one year in maturity 
furthermore  as a result of a change in the company s investment strategy during the third quarter of to limit risk exposure  all of our invested cash has been in money market accounts since october as a result  the interest rate market risk implicit in these investments at december   is low 
however  factors influencing the financial condition of security issuers may impact their ability to meet their financial obligations and could impact the realizability of our security portfolio 
a hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates over the next year would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s debt instruments or our cash equivalents nor would it materially impact the earnings or cash flow associated with our cash investments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
although our revolving line of credit bears interest at an adjustable rate of prime plus  a hypothetical ten percent change in the market rates as of december  would not have a material effect on our earnings and cash flows in  because we anticipate drawing on our line of credit only for short term working capital needs during
