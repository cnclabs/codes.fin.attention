table of contents our business the company designs  manufacturers and markets medical devices for use in ophthalmic and vitreoretinal surgery and neurosurgery 
its products are designed and manufactured to support micro or minimally invasive surgical procedures 
in addition to such surgical devices and equipment  we also design and manufacture disposable and non disposable supplies and accessories for use with such devices and equipment 
for a more detailed description  see item business overview 
we sell our products primarily to hospitals  clinics and surgeons in approximately countries 
sales outside the united states are primarily through local distributors 
as used in this discussion  the company or synergetics usa means the company and its subsidiaries 
new product sales the company s business strategy has been  and is expected to continue to be  the development and marketing of new technologies for the ophthalmic surgery and neurosurgery markets 
new products  which management defines as products introduced within the prior month period  accounted for approximately of total sales for synergetics for fiscal  approximately million 
for fiscal  new products accounted for approximately of total sales for synergetics  or just over million 
this growth was primarily in our capital equipment products both in the ophthalmic and neurosurgery markets 
synergetics past revenue growth has been closely aligned with the adoption by surgeons of new technologies introduced by synergetics 
since july   synergetics has introduced eight new products to the ophthalmic and neurosurgery markets 
we expect adoption rates for the company s new products in the future to have a similar effect on its operating performance 
growth in minimally invasive surgery procedures minimally invasive surgery is surgery performed without making a major incision or opening 
minimally invasive surgery generally results in less trauma for the patient  less likelihood of complications related to the incision and a shorter recovery time 
a growing number of surgical procedures are performed using minimally invasive techniques  creating a multi million dollar market for the specialized devices used in the procedures 
the company has benefited from the overall growth in this market and expects to continue to benefit as it continues to introduce new and improved technologies targeting this market  such as its gauge instrumentation and photon tm xenon light source for the ophthalmic surgical market 
demand trends volume and mix improvements contributed to the majority of sales growth for synergetics during the fiscal years ended july   and ophthalmic procedures volume  particularly retina procedures  on a global basis continues to rise at an estimated growth rate driven by an aging global population  new technologies  advances in surgical techniques and a growing global market resulting from ongoing improvements in healthcare delivery in third world countries  among other factors 
in addition  the demand for high quality products and new technologies  such as the company s innovative instruments and disposables  to support growth in procedures volume continues to positively impact growth 
the company believes innovative surgical approaches will continue to significantly impact the ophthalmic and neurosurgery market 
pricing trends through its strategy of delivering new and higher quality technologies  the company has been generally able to maintain the average selling prices for its products in the face of downward pressure in the healthcare industry 

table of contents competition in the medical device markets and governmental healthcare cost containment efforts  particularly in the united states  have negatively impacted the prices medical device manufacturers received for their products 
the company should be less impacted by this negative pressure than other manufacturers in the industry because its products are primarily used for non discretionary  life or eyesight threatening procedures 
our business strategy our goal is to become a global leader in the development  manufacture and marketing of precision engineered microsurgical instruments  capital equipment and devices for use in vitreoretinal surgery and neurosurgical applications and to grow our product lines in other specialty surgical markets 
our recent combination of the businesses of valley forge and synergetics is a significant component of our strategy toward achieving these goals 
our strategy includes introducing new technology that can be easily differentiated from our competition by capitalizing on our combined successes in delivering minimally invasive products that enable concentrated application to a surgical area with decreased impact beyond the specific desired surgical effects  resulting in improved recovery times and shorter hospital stays  identifying microsurgical niches that may offer the prospect for substantial growth and higher profit margins that allow us an opportunity to build upon our existing technologies  such as expanding the use of our products in ent ear  nose and throat  plastic surgery and other forms of microsurgery  accelerating our international including canada growth by continuing to build on our recent successes supported by valley forge s long established relationships and reputation in global markets  combining the breadth and depth of knowledge  experience and resources in valley forge s and synergetics existing research and development groups to form a new combined research and development capability aligned to deliver precision engineered instruments based on our own proprietary technologies and innovations  branding and marketing a substantial portion of our neurosurgical products with the malis trademark  developing hybrid direct sales independent sales agent distribution channels to assure that our products and benefits are seen by those making or influencing the purchasing decisions  developing our new multifunctional bipolar electrosurgical system  which will be marketed as the malis advantage tm  with our new state of the art bipolar generator and our new proprietary single use hand switching bipolar instruments with enhanced features and functionality to expand the array of procedures they are designed to perform  growing our disposables revenue stream by focusing on the development of a full offering of disposable adjuncts  such as instruments  adapters and fiber optics  to our capital equipment offerings and emphasizing disposables designed to eliminate hospital repair costs and minimize patient to patient disease transfer  expanding the use of our new multifunctional bipolar electrosurgical generator  which will be marketed as the malis advantage tm  into other surgical markets as its increased power and 
table of contents functionality allows the surgeon to perform functions similar to traditional monopolar systems  without the inherent safety limitations  and exploring opportunities for growth through strategic partnering with other companies with complimentary products and technologies to facilitate strategic growth in our defined niche markets  such as our current relationship with stryker corporation

use of estimates and critical accounting policies the financial results of synergetics are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods 
significant accounting polices which require management s judgment are discussed below 
revenue recognition synergetics records revenue from product sales when the revenue is realized and the product is shipped from its facilities 
this includes satisfying the following criteria the arrangement with the customer is evident  usually through receipt of a purchase order  the sales price is fixed and determinable  delivery has occurred  and collectibility is reasonably ensured 
inventories inventories  consisting of purchased materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost  with cost being determined using the first in first out fifo method  or market 
periodically  synergetics evaluates inventories for excess quantities and identified obsolescence 
its evaluation includes an analysis of historical sales levels by product and projections of future demand  as well as estimates of quantities required to support warranty and other repairs 
to the extent that it determines there are some excess quantities based on its projected levels of sales and other requirements  or obsolete material in inventory  it records valuation reserves against all or a portion of the value of the related parts or products 
if future demand or market conditions are different than synergetics projections  a change in recorded inventory valuation reserves may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
loss contingencies synergetics is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of its business  including claims by employees or former employees  with respect to its products and involving commercial disputes 
synergetics financial statements do not reflect any material amounts related to possible unfavorable outcomes of claims and lawsuits to which it is currently a party because management currently believes that such claims and lawsuits are either adequately covered by insurance or otherwise indemnified  and are not expected  individually or in the aggregate  to result in a material adverse effect on synergetics financial condition 
however  it is possible that synergetics results of operations  financial position and cash flows in a particular period could be materially affected by these contingencies if management changes its assessment of the likely outcome of these matters 

table of contents amortization periods synergetics records amortization of intangible assets using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of these assets 
it bases the determination of these useful lives on the period over which it expects the related assets to contribute to its cash flows or in the case of patents  their legal life  whichever is shorter 
if synergetics assessment of the useful lives of intangible assets changes  it may change future amortization expense see impairment of long lived assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts synergetics evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations to synergetics  synergetics records an allowance against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount that management reasonably expects to collect 
for all other customers  synergetics records allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  the current business environment and its historical experience 
if the financial condition of customers or the length of time that receivables are past due were to change  synergetics may change the recorded amount of allowances for doubtful accounts in the future 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the group of assets and their eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount of fair value less costs to sell 
deferred tax assets and liabilities synergetics deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when a determination is made that is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
stock based compensation synergetics accounts for stock based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method of accounting 
under this method  stock based compensation expense is based on the difference  if any  on the date of the grant between the fair value of synergetics stock and the exercise price of the award

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rate variability 

table of contents the company has a revolving credit facility and an equipment line of credit facility in place 
the revolving credit facility had an outstanding balance of  at july  and the equipment line of credit facility had an outstanding balance of  at july   bearing interest at the bank s prime lending rate 
interest expense from these credit facilities is subject to market risk in the form of fluctuations in interest rates 
assuming the current levels of borrowings at variable rates and a two percentage point increase in the average interest rate on these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense would have increased by approximately  the company does not perform any interest rate hedging activities related to these two facilities 
additionally  the company has exposure to foreign currency fluctuations through export sales to international accounts 
as only approximately of our sales revenue is denominated in foreign currencies  we estimate that a change in the relative strength of the dollar to foreign currencies would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the company does not conduct any hedging activities related foreign currency
