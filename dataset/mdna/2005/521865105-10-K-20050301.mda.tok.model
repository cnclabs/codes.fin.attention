improve european business structure and expand european market share 
in europe  the automotive market remains relatively fragmented with significant overcapacity  making europe a difficult 
table of contents market for automotive manufacturers and suppliers alike 
we are continuing to improve our financial results in europe by focusing significant new product initiatives on seating  electronics and cockpit programs  where there are opportunities for significant scale and we have a strong competitive position 
we are also improving our overall business structure in europe by consolidating administrative functions and reducing manufacturing costs by relocating and expanding component production in countries with lower labor costs 
capitalize on systems and integration opportunities 
the same competitive pressures that led automotive manufacturers to outsource individual automotive interior components to independent suppliers have caused our customers to demand delivery of fully integrated automotive interior systems for new vehicle models 
as automotive manufacturers continue to seek ways to differentiate their vehicles in the marketplace  improve quality and reduce costs  we believe they will increasingly seek fewer independent suppliers to manage the design  engineering  sourcing  manufacturing and delivery of fully integrated automotive interior systems 
we were awarded the first ever total interior integrator program by general motors for the cadillac dts and buick lucerne models 
we intend to leverage our leadership position in total interiors  particularly in north america  to offer one stop interior solutions to our customers 
leverage electronic capabilities and invest in product technology and design capability 
consumers are demanding more in their automotive interiors  focusing on convenience  communication and safety  and automotive manufacturers increasingly view the vehicle interior as a major selling point to their customers 
because electronic products and electrical distribution systems are an important part of automotive interior systems  we seek to take advantage of our capabilities in these areas to develop new products that respond to customer and consumer demands 
we will also continue to make investments in technology and design capabilities to support our existing products  as well as our new product development efforts 
the focus of our research and development efforts is to identify new interior features that make vehicles safer  more comfortable and more attractive to consumers 
we believe that in order to effectively develop total automotive interiors  it is necessary to integrate the engineering  research  design  development and validation of all of the automotive interior systems 
we conduct extensive analysis and testing of consumer responses to automotive interior styling and innovations 
we also have state of the art acoustics testing and instrumentation and data analysis capabilities 
we maintain six advanced technology centers and several customer focused product engineering centers where we design and develop new products and conduct extensive product testing 
in addition  our advanced technology center in southfield  michigan  demonstrates our ability to integrate engineering  research  design  development and validation capabilities for all five automotive interior systems at one location 
maintain flexible and efficient cost structure 
by maintaining a relatively flexible cost structure  we are better able to withstand fluctuations in industry demand over time  as well as changing competitive and macroeconomic conditions 
our variable cost structure is maintained  in part  through ongoing six sigma initiatives throughout the organization  as well as initiatives to promote and enhance the sharing of technology  engineering  purchasing and capital investments across customer platforms and facility consolidation actions to align our business with changing market conditions 
we are working to leverage our scale and interior expertise to develop common vehicle architecture to reduce the complexity and variety of substructures that are not seen by consumers 
one example is the lear flexible seat architecture  a modular system that incorporates many desired comfort and required safety features utilizing validated common components that can be packaged in multiple seat systems 
the advantage is reduced design  engineering and development costs to deliver an enhanced end product with improved quality and craftsmanship 
we also have a low cost country strategy to increase our global competitiveness from both a manufacturing and sourcing standpoint 
over sixty of our facilities are currently located in low cost regions  including mexico  hungary  poland  south africa  the philippines  china  honduras  slovakia  turkey  the czech republic  tunisia  morocco and romania 
in an effort to continue to strengthen our relationships with our customers  we have partnered with them to work proactively to reduce costs and eliminate waste by establishing cost technology optimization centers in the united states  germany  spain  the philippines and brazil 
cost technology optimization centers provide a venue where our engineers can 
table of contents meet with customers to identify cost discrepancies among similar products and inconsistencies in features among vehicles in similar segments 
strategic acquisitions 
we intend to selectively pursue strategic acquisitions  where appropriate  to expand or complement our existing business while maintaining a strong balance sheet 
we will focus on financially attractive acquisitions that strengthen our relationships with our customers  enhance our existing products  processes and technological capabilities or lower our costs 
we expect that any such acquisitions will be consistent with our core business of providing high quality automotive interior systems and components 
in particular  we may seek acquisitions that further our strategy of expanding our business in asian markets and with asian automotive manufacturers or complement our focus in europe on our seating and electronic and electrical segments 
in  we expanded our electronic and electrical capabilities by acquiring a terminals and connectors business located principally in europe 
this acquisition provides us with increased technical capabilities to design and produce terminals and connectors  which represent approximately of the value of a wire harness  and junction boxes containing integrated electronic functions 
we plan to leverage these new capabilities on a worldwide basis 
products we conduct our business in three product operating segments seating  interior  and electronic and electrical 
the seating segment includes seat systems and components thereof 
the interior segment includes instrument panels and cockpit systems  overhead systems  door panels  flooring and acoustic systems and other interior products 
the electronic and electrical segment includes electronic products and electrical distribution systems  primarily wire harnesses and junction boxes  interior control and entertainment systems  and wireless systems 
net sales by product segment as a percentage of total net sales is shown below for the year ended december  seating interior electronic and electrical for further information related to our reportable operating segments  see note  segment reporting  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
seating 
the seating segment consists of the manufacture  assembly and supply of vehicle seating requirements 
seat systems typically represent to of the total cost of an automotive interior 
we produce seat systems for automobiles and light trucks that are fully assembled and ready for installation 
in most cases  seat systems are designed and engineered for specific vehicle models or platforms 
we have recently developed lear flexible seat architecture  whereby we can assist our customers in achieving a faster time to market by building a program specific seat incorporating the latest performance requirements and safety technology in a shorter period of time 
seat systems are designed to achieve maximum passenger comfort by adding a wide range of manual and power features  such as lumbar supports  cushion and back bolsters and leg supports 
as a result of our strong product design and product technology  we are a leader in designing seats with convenience features and enhanced safety 
for example  our protec tm plus self aligning head restraint is an advancement in seat passive safety features 
by integrating the head restraint with the lumbar support  the occupant s head is provided support earlier and for a longer period of time in a rear impact collision  potentially reducing the risk of injury 
in addition  we are the exclusive manufacturer of a patented integrated restraint seat system that uses an ultra high strength steel tower and a split frame design to improve occupant comfort and convenience 
we have also developed occusense  a seat technology which detects the size and weight of an occupant to control airbag deployment 
we are also filling the growing customer demand for reconfigurable seats with our thin profile rear seat and our stadium slide seat system 
for example  the ford freestyle  cadillac srx and 
table of contents dodge durango use our reconfigurable seating technology  and the ford explorer and dodge durango use our thin profile seating technology for their third row seats 
interior 
the interior segment consists of the manufacture  assembly and supply of interior systems and components 
interior products are designed to provide a harmonious and comfortable interior for the vehicle occupants  as well as a variety of functional and safety features 
set forth below is a description of our principal interior products instrument panels and cockpit systems 
the instrument panel is a complex system of coverings and foam  as well as plastic and metal parts designed to house various components and to act as a safety device for the vehicle occupant 
the cockpit system consists of  among other things  the instrument panel trim pad  structural subsystem  electrical distribution system  climate control  driver control pedals  steering controls and driver and passenger safety systems 
specific components of the cockpit system include the instrument cluster gauges  cross car structure  electronic and electrical components  wire harness  audio system  heating  ventilation and air conditioning module  air distribution ducts  air vents  steering column and wheel and glove compartment assemblies 
airbag technologies also continue to be an important component of cockpit systems 
as a result of our research and development efforts  we have introduced cost effective  integrated  seamless airbag covers  which we believe will increase occupant safety  as well as provide greater styling flexibility for the automotive manufacturer 
we believe that future trends in instrument panels and cockpit systems will focus on safety related features 
we have also developed spray pur tm  a seamless polyurethane coating for instrument panels  which eliminates visual seams 
this process will be used on the cadillac dts and buick lucerne models beginning in and the cadillac escalade beginning in overhead systems 
overhead systems consist of a headliner  lighting  visors  consoles  wiring and electronics  as well as all other products located in the interior of the vehicle roof 
headliners consist of a substrate  as well as a finished interior layer made of a variety of fabrics and materials 
while headliners are an important contributor to interior aesthetics  they also provide insulation from road noise and can serve as carriers for a variety of other components  such as visors  overhead consoles  grab handles  coat hooks  electrical wiring  speakers  lighting and other electronic and electrical products 
as the amount of electronic and electrical content available in vehicles has increased  headliners have emerged as an important carrier of technology since electronic features ranging from garage door openers to lighting systems are often optimally situated in the headliner 
door panels 
door panels consist of several component parts  which are attached to a substrate by various methods 
specific components include vinyl or cloth covered appliqu s  armrests  radio speaker grilles  map pocket compartments  carpet and sound reducing insulation 
in addition  door systems often incorporate electronic products and electrical distribution systems  including lock and latch  window glass  window regulators and audio systems  as well as wire harnesses for the control of power seats  windows  mirrors and door locks 
flooring and acoustic systems 
we have an extensive and comprehensive portfolio of sonotec acoustic products  including flooring systems and dash insulators 
these acoustic products provide noise  vibration and harshness resistance 
carpet flooring systems generally consist of tufted or non woven carpet with a thermoplastic backcoating  which when heated  allows the carpet to be fitted precisely to the interior or trunk compartment of the vehicle 
non carpeted flooring systems  used primarily in commercial and fleet vehicles  offer improved wear and maintenance characteristics 
the dash insulator  mounted onto the firewall  separates the passenger compartment from the engine compartment and is the primary component for preventing engine noise from entering the passenger compartment 
electronic and electrical 
the migration from conventional electrical distribution systems to electronic products and electrical distribution systems is facilitating the integration of wiring  electronics and switch control products within the overall electrical architecture of a vehicle 
this migration can reduce the overall system cost and weight and improve reliability and packaging by optimizing the overall system architecture and eliminating a portion of the terminals  connectors and wires normally 
table of contents required for a conventional electrical distribution system 
our umbrella technology  intertronics  reflects our ability to integrate electronic products with automotive interior systems 
this technology is already having an impact on a number of new and next generation products 
for example  our integrated seat adjuster module has two dozen fewer cut circuits and five fewer connectors  weighs a half of a pound less and costs twenty percent less than a traditional seat wiring system 
in addition  our smart junction box expands the traditional junction box functionality by utilizing printed circuit board technologies 
our electronic and electrical products can be grouped into three categories electrical distribution systems 
wire harness assemblies are a collection of terminals  connectors and wires that connect all of the various electronic electrical devices in the vehicle to each other and or to a power source 
terminals and connectors are components of wire harnesses and other electronic electrical devices that connect wire harnesses and electronic electrical devices 
fuse boxes are centrally located boxes in the vehicle that contain fuses and or relays for circuit and device protection  as well as power distribution 
junction boxes serve as a connection point for multiple wire harnesses 
they may also contain fuses and relays for circuit and device protection 
smart junction boxes are junction boxes with integrated electronic functions  which eliminate interconnections and increase overall system reliability 
certain vehicles may have two or three smart junction boxes linked as a multiplexed buss line 
interior control and entertainment systems 
the instrument panel center console module provides a control panel for the entertainment system  accessory switch functions  heating  ventilation and air conditioning 
the multifunction turn signal module consolidates various combinations of hazard lights  headlamps  parking lamps  fog lamps  wiper and washer  cruise control  high low headlamp beams and turn signal functions

the integrated door module consolidates the controls for window lift  door lock  power mirror and seat heating and ventilation 
lear s intertronics flip pack tm integrates electrical and interior components and performs all power seat and power door functions from two stacked panels  improving access for drivers 
the mechatronic tm lighting control module integrates electronic control logic and diagnostics with the headlamp switch 
entertainment products include audio amplifiers  video modules and the floor mounted mediaconsole with a flip up screen that provides dvd and video game viewing for back seat passengers 
wireless systems 
wireless systems include passive entry systems  dual range dual function remote keyless entry systems and tire pressure monitoring systems 
passive entry systems allow the vehicle operator to unlock the door without using a key or physically activating a remote keyless fob 
dual range dual function remote keyless entry systems allow a single transmitter to perform multiple functions depending on the operator s distance from the vehicle 
our caru tm remote keyless entry system can control and display the status of the vehicle  such as starting the engine  locking and unlocking the doors  opening the trunk and setting the cabin temperature 
in addition  dual range dual function remote keyless entry systems combine remote keyless operations with vehicle immobilizer capability 
we have also created custom key fobs with personalized decorative molding which include a wide variety of design patterns and colors  including textures  logos and text 
our tire pressure monitoring system  known as the lear intellitire tire pressure monitoring system  alerts drivers when a tire has low pressure 
intellitire has received production awards from ford for many of their north american vehicles and from hyundai for several models beginning in some form of tire pressure monitoring system will be required on all new vehicles in the united states 
for model year  it is expected that manufacturers will need to include tire pressure monitoring systems on of new vehicles  increasing to by model year 
table of contents manufacturing a description of the manufacturing processes for each of our operating segments is set forth below 
seating 
our seating facilities generally use just in time manufacturing techniques  and products are delivered to the automotive manufacturers on a just in time basis 
these facilities are typically located near our customers manufacturing and assembly sites 
our seating facilities utilize a variety of methods whereby foam and fabric are affixed to an underlying seat frame 
raw materials used in our seat systems  including steel  aluminum and foam chemicals  are generally available and obtained from multiple suppliers under various supply agreements 
leather  fabric and certain components are also purchased from multiple suppliers under various supply agreements 
the majority of our steel purchases are comprised of engineered parts that are integrated into a seat system  such as seat frames  mechanisms and mechanical components 
therefore  our exposure to changes in steel prices is primarily indirect  through the supply base 
historically  these purchased components have not been covered by long term  fixed price supply agreements 
interior 
our interior systems process capabilities include injection molding  low pressure injection molding  blow molding  compression molding  rotational molding  urethane foaming and vacuum forming  as well as various trimming and finishing methods 
raw materials  including resin and chemical products  and finished components are assembled into end products and are obtained from multiple suppliers  under supply agreements which typically last for up to one year 
in addition  we produce carpet at one north american plant 
electronic and electrical 
electrical distribution systems are networks of wiring and associated control devices that route electrical power and signals throughout the vehicle 
wire harness assemblies consist of raw  coiled wire  which is automatically cut to length and terminated 
individual circuits are assembled together on a jig or table  inserted into connectors and wrapped or taped to form wire harness assemblies 
all materials are purchased from suppliers  with the exception of a portion of the terminals and connectors that are produced internally 
certain materials are available from a limited number of suppliers 
supply agreements typically last for up to one year 
the assembly process is labor intensive  and as a result  production is generally performed in low cost labor sites in mexico  honduras  the philippines  eastern europe and northern africa 
some of the principal components attached to the wire harness assemblies that we manufacture include junction boxes  electronic control modules and switches 
junction boxes are manufactured in both north america and europe with a proprietary  capital intensive assembly process  using printed circuit boards purchased from selected suppliers 
proprietary processes have been developed to improve the function of these junction boxes in harsh environments  including high temperatures and humidity 
electronic control modules are assembled using high speed surface mount placement equipment in both north america and europe 
switches are assembled from electrical  mechanical and decorated plastic parts purchased in the united states  mexico and europe  using a combination of manual and automated assembly and test methods 
while we internally manufacture many of the components that are described above  a substantial portion of these components are furnished by independent  tier ii automotive suppliers and other vendors throughout the world 
in certain instances  it would be difficult and expensive for us to change suppliers of products and services that are critical to our business 
with the recent decline in automotive production and substantial and continuing pressures to reduce costs  certain of our suppliers have experienced  or may experience  financial difficulties 
we seek to carefully manage our supplier relationships to minimize any significant disruptions of our operations 
however  adverse developments affecting one or more of our major suppliers  including certain sole source suppliers  could negatively impact our operating results 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors adverse developments affecting one or more of our major suppliers could harm our profitability

item legal proceedings commercial disputes we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings and claims relating to commercial or contractual disputes  including disputes with our suppliers 
we will continue to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims 
based on present information  including our assessment of the merits of the particular claims  we do not expect that these legal proceedings or claims  either individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated financial position or results of operations  although the outcomes of these matters are inherently uncertain 
on january   seton company  one of our leather suppliers  filed a suit alleging that we had breached a purported agreement to purchase leather from seton for seats for the life of the general motors gmt program 
this suit presently is pending in the us district court for the eastern district of michigan 
seton seeks compensatory and exemplary damages on breach of contract and promissory estoppel claims and has submitted a revised report now alleging up to million in damages  we will challenge several of the assumptions and bases for this revised report 
we continue to believe that we have meritorious defenses to seton s liability and damages claims and intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit 
the trial is expected to begin in the march april timeframe 
product liability matters in the event that use of our products results in  or is alleged to result in  bodily injury and or property damage or other losses  we may be subject to product liability lawsuits and other claims 
in addition  we are a party to warranty sharing and other agreements with our customers relating to our products 
these customers may pursue claims against us for contribution of all or a portion of the amounts sought in connection with product liability and warranty claims 
we can provide no assurances that we will not experience material claims in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims 
in addition  if any of our products are  or are alleged to be  defective  we may be required or requested by our customers to participate in a recall or other corrective action involving such products 
certain of our customers have asserted claims against us for costs related to recalls involving our products 
in certain instances  the allegedly defective 
table of contents products were supplied by tier ii suppliers against whom we have sought or will seek contribution 
we carry insurance for certain legal matters  including product liability claims  but such coverage may be limited 
we do not maintain insurance for recall matters 
environmental matters we are subject to local  state  federal and foreign laws  regulations and ordinances which govern activities or operations that may have adverse environmental effects and which impose liability for the costs of cleaning up certain damages resulting from past spills  disposals or other releases of hazardous wastes and environmental compliance 
our policy is to comply with all applicable environmental laws and to maintain an environmental management program based on iso to ensure compliance 
however  we currently are  have been and in the future may become the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or procedures 
we have been named as a potentially responsible party at several third party landfill sites and are engaged in the cleanup of hazardous waste at certain sites owned  leased or operated by us  including several properties acquired in our acquisition of ut automotive  inc ut automotive 
certain present and former properties of ut automotive are subject to environmental liabilities which may be significant 
we obtained agreements and indemnities with respect to certain environmental liabilities from united technologies corporation utc in connection with our acquisition of ut automotive 
utc manages and directly funds these environmental liabilities pursuant to its agreements and indemnities with us 
while we do not believe that the environmental liabilities associated with our current and former properties will have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated financial position or results of operations  no assurances can be given in this regard 
one of our subsidiaries and certain predecessor companies were named as defendants in an action filed by three plaintiffs in august in the circuit court of lowndes county  mississippi  asserting claims stemming from alleged environmental contamination caused by an automobile parts manufacturing plant located in columbus  mississippi 
the plant was acquired by us as part of the ut automotive acquisition in may and sold almost immediately thereafter  in june  to johnson electric holdings limited johnson electric 
in december  additional cases were filed by approximately  plaintiffs in the same court against us and other defendants relating to similar claims 
in september  we were dismissed as a party to these cases 
in the first half of  we were named again as a defendant in these same additional cases and were also named in five new actions filed by approximately individual plaintiffs related to alleged environmental contamination from the same facility 
the plaintiffs in these actions are persons who allegedly were either residents and or owned property near the facility or worked at the facility 
in november  two additional lawsuits were filed by plaintiffs individuals and organizations  alleging property damage as a result of the alleged contamination 
each of these complaints seeks compensatory and punitive damages 
most of the original plaintiffs have recently filed motions to dismiss their claims for health effects and personal injury damages  therefore  approximately three fourths of the plaintiffs should be voluntarily dismissed from these lawsuits 
upon the completion of these dismissals  we anticipate that there will be approximately plaintiffs remaining in the case to proceed with property damage claims only 
there is the potential that the dismissed plaintiffs could seek separate counsel to re file their personal injury claims 
to date  there has been limited discovery in these cases and the probability of liability and the amount of damages in the event of liability are unknown 
utc  the former owner of ut automotive  and johnson electric have each sought indemnification from us under the respective acquisition agreements  and we have claimed indemnification from them under the same agreements 
to date  no company admits to  or has been found to have  an obligation to fully defend and indemnify any other 
we intend to vigorously defend against these claims and believe that we will eventually be indemnified by either utc or johnson electric for resulting losses  if any

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we are one of the world s largest automotive interior systems suppliers based on net sales 
our net sales have grown from billion for the year ended december   to billion for the year ended december  the major source of our internal growth has been new program awards 
we supply every major automotive manufacturer in the world  including general motors  ford  daimlerchrysler  bmw  psa  fiat  volkswagen  renault nissan  mazda  toyota  subaru and hyundai 
we have capabilities in all five principal segments of the automotive interior market seat systems  instrument panels and cockpit systems  overhead systems  door panels  and flooring and acoustic systems 
we are also one of the leading global suppliers of automotive electrical distribution systems 
as a result of these capabilities  we can offer our customers fully integrated automotive interiors  including electronic products and electrical distribution systems 
we were awarded the first ever total interior integrator program by general motors for the cadillac dts and buick lucerne models 
as a total interior integrator  we work closely with the customer on the design and have lead or sole responsibility for the engineering  component module sourcing  manufacturing and delivery of the automotive interiors for these two passenger cars 
demand for our products is directly related to automotive vehicle production 
automotive sales and production can be affected by general economic or industry conditions  labor relations issues  regulatory requirements  trade agreements and other factors 
our operating results are also significantly impacted by what is referred to in this section as vehicle platform mix  that is  the overall commercial success of the vehicle platforms for which we supply particular products  as well as our relative profitability on these platforms 
in addition  our two largest customers  general motors and ford  accounted for approximately of our net sales in  excluding net sales to opel  saab  volvo  jaguar and land rover  which are affiliates of general motors or ford 
a significant loss of business with respect to any vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could materially and negatively affect our operating results 
automotive industry conditions in north america and europe continue to be challenging 
in north america  the industry is characterized by significant overcapacity  fierce competition and significant pension and healthcare liabilities for the domestic automakers 
in addition  the domestic automakers have recently announced production cuts which significantly impact several of our key platforms 
in europe  the market structure is relatively fragmented with significant overcapacity  and several of our key platforms experienced significant production declines in in both of our major markets  certain of our key platforms are undergoing model changeovers or refreshenings that will have a larger than normal adverse impact on our vehicle platform mix in historically  the majority of our sales have been derived from the us based automotive manufacturers in north america  as well as automotive manufacturers in western europe 
as discussed below  our ability to increase sales in the future will depend  in part  on our ability to increase our penetration of asian automotive manufacturers worldwide and leverage our existing north american and european customer base across all product lines 
our customers require us to reduce costs and  at the same time  assume greater responsibility for the design  development  engineering and integration of interior products 
we seek to enhance our profitability by investing in technology  design capabilities and new product initiatives that respond to the needs of our customers and consumers 
our profitability is also dependent on our ability to achieve product cost reductions  including cost reductions from our suppliers 
finally  we continually evaluate alternatives to align our business with the changing needs of our customers and to lower the operating costs of our company 
this includes the realignment of our existing manufacturing capacity  facility closures or similar actions 
increases in certain raw material and commodity costs  such as steel  resins and diesel fuel  had a significant adverse impact on our operating results in and will continue to negatively affect our profitability in we have developed strategies to mitigate or partially offset the impact  which include aggressive cost reduction actions  the selective in sourcing of components where we have available capacity  the continued consolidation of our supply base and the acceleration of low cost country sourcing and 
table of contents engineering 
in addition  the sharing of increased raw material costs has been  and will continue to be  the subject of negotiations with our customers 
while we believe that our mitigation efforts will offset a substantial portion of the financial impact of these increased costs  no assurances can be given that the magnitude and duration of these increased costs will not have a material impact on our future operating results 
see forward looking statements and risk factors high raw material costs may continue to have a significant adverse impact on our profitability 
in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance  we focus primarily on profitable sales growth and cash flows  as well as return on invested capital on a consolidated basis 
in addition to maintaining and expanding our business with our existing customers in our more established markets  we have increased our emphasis on expanding our business in eastern european and asian markets and with asian automotive manufacturers worldwide 
the eastern european and asian markets present growth opportunities  as automotive manufacturers expand production in these markets to meet increasing demand 
we have opened new facilities to support growth in the czech republic and slovakia  and we are expanding our low cost operations in poland and romania 
we currently have twelve joint ventures in china and several other joint ventures dedicated to serving asian automotive manufacturers 
we will continue to seek ways to expand our business in eastern european and asian markets and with asian automotive manufacturers worldwide 
our success in generating cash flow will depend  in part  on our ability to efficiently manage working capital 
working capital can be significantly impacted by the timing of cash flows from sales and purchases 
in this regard  changes in certain customer payment terms are expected to have a negative impact on our reported cash flows through but are not expected to have a significant impact on our average daily cash flows 
in addition  our cash flow is also dependent on our ability to efficiently manage our capital spending 
we utilize return on invested capital as a measure of the efficiency with which assets are deployed to increase earnings 
improvements in our return on invested capital will depend on our ability to maintain an appropriate asset base for our business and to increase productivity and operating efficiency

table of contents sales backlog as of december   we had a sales backlog of  million for orders to be executed in our sales backlog reflects anticipated net sales from awarded new programs  less net sales from phased out and canceled programs 
the calculation of backlog does not reflect customer price reductions on existing or newly awarded programs 
the sales backlog may be impacted by various assumptions embedded in the calculation  including vehicle production levels on new and replacement programs  foreign exchange rates and the timing of program launches 
in addition  we typically enter into agreements with our customers at the beginning of a vehicle s life for the fulfillment of our customers purchasing requirements for the entire production life of the vehicle 
although instances of early termination have historically been rare  these agreements generally may be terminated by our customers at any time 
therefore  our backlog information does not reflect firm orders or firm commitments 
facility consolidations we continually evaluate alternatives to align our business with the changing needs of our customers and to lower the operating costs of our company 
this includes the realignment of our existing manufacturing capacity  facility closures or similar actions in the normal course of business

in addition to the obligations set forth above  we have capital requirements with respect to new programs 
we enter into agreements with our customers to produce products at the beginning of a vehicle s life 
although such agreements do not provide for minimum quantities  once we enter into such agreements  fulfillment of our customers purchasing requirements is our obligation for the entire production life of the vehicle 
prior to being formally awarded a program  we typically work closely with our customers in the early stages of designing and engineering a vehicle s interior systems 
failure to complete the design and engineering work related to a vehicle s interior systems  or to fulfill a customer s contract  could adversely affect our business

please see executive overview  forward looking statements and risk factors 

table of contents market risk sensitivity in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risk associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
we manage these risks through the use of derivative financial instruments in accordance with management s guidelines 
we enter into all hedging transactions for periods consistent with the underlying exposures 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes 
foreign exchange operating results may be impacted by our buying  selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currency of our operating companies transactional exposure 
we mitigate this risk by entering into forward foreign exchange  futures and option contracts 
the foreign exchange contracts are executed with banks that we believe are creditworthy 
gains and losses related to foreign exchange contracts are deferred and included in the measurement of the foreign currency transaction subject to the hedge 
gains and losses incurred related to foreign exchange contracts are generally offset by the direct effects of currency movements on the underlying transactions 
our most significant foreign currency transactional exposures relate to the mexican peso  the canadian dollar and the euro 
we have performed a quantitative analysis of our overall currency rate exposure as of december  the potential earnings benefit related to transactional exposures from a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar relative to all other currencies for is approximately million 
the potential earnings benefit related to transactional exposures from a similar strengthening of the euro relative to all other currencies for is approximately million 
as of december   foreign exchange contracts representing billion of notional amount were outstanding with maturities of less than twelve months 
as of december   the fair market value of these contracts was approximately million 
a change in the value of the us dollar relative to all other currencies would result in a million change in the aggregate fair market value of these contracts 
a change in the value of the euro relative to all other currencies would result in a million change in the aggregate fair market value of these contracts 
there are certain shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analysis presented 
the analysis assumes that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the us dollar or euro 
in reality  some currencies may strengthen while others may weaken  causing the earnings impact to increase or decrease depending on the currency and the direction of the rate movement 
in addition to the transactional exposure described above  our operating results are impacted by the translation of our foreign operating income into us dollars translation exposure 
we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts to mitigate this exposure 
interest rates we use a combination of fixed and variable rate debt and interest rate swap contracts to manage our exposure to interest rate movements 
our exposure to variable interest rates on outstanding floating rate debt instruments indexed to united states or european monetary union short term money market rates is partially managed by the use of interest rate swap contracts to convert certain variable rate debt obligations to fixed rate  matching effective and maturity dates to specific debt instruments 
we also utilize interest rate swap contracts to convert certain fixed rate debt obligations to variable rate  matching effective and maturity date to specific debt instruments 
all of our interest rate swap contracts are executed with banks that we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies that match the underlying debt instrument 
net interest payments or receipts from interest rate swap contracts are recorded as adjustments to interest expense in our consolidated statements of income on an accrual basis 
as of december   there were no contracts outstanding which convert variable rate debt obligations to fixed rate  only contracts which convert fixed rate debt obligations to variable rate 
we have performed a quantitative analysis of our overall interest rate exposure as of december  this analysis assumes an instantaneous basis point parallel shift in interest rates at all points of the yield 
table of contents curve 
the potential adverse earnings impact from this hypothetical increase for is approximately million 
as of december   interest rate swap contracts representing million of notional amount were outstanding with maturity dates of may through may all of these contracts are designated as fair value hedges and modify the fixed rate characteristics of our outstanding long term debt instruments 
the fair market value of all outstanding interest rate swap contracts is subject to changes in value due to changes in interest rates 
as of december   the fair market value of these contracts was approximately negative million 
a basis point parallel shift in interest rates would result in a million change in the aggregate fair market value of these contracts 
commodity prices we have commodity price risk with respect to purchases of certain raw materials  including steel  leather  resins and diesel fuel 
in limited circumstances  we have used financial instruments to mitigate this risk 
increases in certain raw material or commodity costs  principally steel and oil based commodities  have had a significant adverse impact on our operating results in and will continue to negatively affect our profitability in we have developed strategies to mitigate or partially offset the impact  which include aggressive cost reduction actions  the selective in sourcing of components where we have available capacity  the continued consolidation of our supply base and the acceleration of low cost country sourcing and engineering 
in addition  the sharing of increased raw material costs has been  and will continue to be  the subject of negotiations with our customers 
while we believe that our mitigation efforts will offset a substantial portion of the financial impact of these increased costs  no assurances can be given that the magnitude and duration of these increased costs will not have a material impact on our future operating results 
see forward looking statements and risk factors high raw material costs may continue to have a significant adverse impact on our profitability

other matters pension and other postretirement benefit plans approximately of our active workforce is covered by defined benefit pension plans 
approximately of our active workforce is covered by other postretirement benefit plans 
pension plans provide benefits based on plan specific benefit formulas as defined by the applicable plan documents 
postretirement benefit plans generally provide for the continuation of medical benefits for all eligible employees 
we also have contractual arrangements with certain employees which provide for supplemental retirement benefits 
in general  our policy is to fund our pension benefit obligation based on legal requirements  tax considerations and local practices 
we do not fund our postretirement benefit obligation 
as of december  based on a september  measurement date  our projected benefit obligations related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans were million and million  respectively 
these obligations were valued using a weighted average discount rate of for domestic plans  for foreign pension plans and for foreign other postretirement benefit plans 
discount rates are determined based on a review of the rates of return for high quality long term bonds  such as moody s long term aa bond index for domestic plans 
as of december  and  our unfunded pension benefit obligation was million and million  respectively 
for each of the years ended december  and  pension net periodic benefit cost was million and was determined using a variety of actuarial assumptions 
pension net periodic benefit cost was calculated using an expected return on plan assets of for domestic plans and for foreign plans in both and the expected return on plan assets is determined based on several factors  including adjusted historical returns  historical risk premiums for various asset classes and target asset allocations within the portfolio 
adjustments made to the historical returns are based on recent return experience in the equity and 
table of contents fixed income markets and the belief that deviations from historical returns are likely over the relevant investment horizon 
pension net periodic benefit cost is estimated to be approximately million in this estimate is based on a weighted average discount rate of and an expected return on plan assets of for domestic plans and for foreign plans 
actual cost is also dependent on various other factors related to the employees covered by these plans 
we believe that these actuarial assumptions are reasonable 
adjustments to our actuarial assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
decreasing the discount rate by would have increased the pension benefit obligation and the pension net periodic benefit cost by approximately million and approximately million  respectively  as of and for the year ended december  decreasing the expected return on plan assets by would have increased the pension net periodic benefit cost by approximately million for the year ended december  we expect to contribute approximately million to million to our domestic and foreign pension plans in contributions to our pension plans are consistent with minimum funding requirements of the relevant governmental authorities 
we may make contributions in excess of these minimums when we believe it is financially advantageous to do so and based on our other capital requirements 
in december  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the medicare act was enacted 
the medicare act introduced a prescription drug benefit under medicare medicare part d  as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of certain other postretirement benefit plans that provide prescription drug benefits at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  which provides the applicable accounting guidance related to the federal subsidy 
in accordance with the transition provisions of fsp  the effects of the medicare act are reflected in the measurement of the postretirement benefit obligation and postretirement net periodic benefit cost as of and for the year ended december  the effects of adoption were not significant

legal and environmental matters we are involved from time to time in certain legal proceedings and claims  including  without limitation  commercial or contractual disputes 
on january   seton company  one of our leather suppliers  filed a suit alleging that we had breached a purported agreement to purchase leather from seton for seats for the life of the general motors gmt program 
this suit presently is pending in the us district court for the eastern district of michigan 
seton seeks compensatory and exemplary damages on breach of contract and promissory estoppel claims and has submitted a revised report now alleging up to million in damages  we will challenge several of the assumptions and bases for this revised report 
we continue to believe that we have meritorious defenses to seton s liability and damages claims and intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit 
the trial is expected to begin in the march april timeframe 
we are subject to local  state  federal and foreign laws  regulations and ordinances which govern activities or operations that may have adverse environmental effects and which impose liability for the costs of cleaning up certain damages resulting from past spills  disposals or other releases of hazardous wastes and environmental compliance 
our policy is to comply with all applicable environmental laws and to maintain an environmental management program based on iso to ensure compliance 
however  we currently are  have been and in the future may become the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or procedures 
we have been named as a potentially responsible party at several third party landfill sites and are engaged in the cleanup of hazardous waste at certain sites owned  leased or operated by us  including several properties acquired in our acquisition of ut automotive  inc ut automotive 
certain present and former 
table of contents properties of ut automotive are subject to environmental liabilities which may be significant 
we obtained agreements and indemnities with respect to certain environmental liabilities from united technologies corporation utc in connection with our acquisition of ut automotive 
utc manages and directly funds these environmental liabilities pursuant to its agreements and indemnities with us 
while we do not believe that the environmental liabilities associated with our current and former properties will have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated financial position or results of operations  no assurances can be given in this regard 
in january  the securities and exchange commission the sec commenced an informal inquiry into our september amendment of our form k 
the amendment was filed to report our employment of relatives of certain of our directors and officers and certain related party transactions 
the sec s inquiry does not relate to our financial statements 
in february  the staff of the sec informed us that it proposed to recommend to the sec that it issue an administrative cease and desist order as a result of our failure to disclose the related party transactions in question prior to the amendment of our form k 
we expect to consent to the entry of the order as part of a settlement of this matter 
for further information regarding legal and environmental matters  see item legal proceedings 
certain tax matters ut automotive prior to our acquisition of ut automotive from utc in may  a subsidiary of lear purchased the stock of a ut automotive subsidiary 
in connection with the acquisition  we agreed to indemnify utc for certain tax consequences if the internal revenue service the irs overturned utc s tax treatment of the transaction 
the irs recently issued a notice of proposed adjustment to utc related to the acquisition seeking an increase in tax of approximately million  excluding interest 
an indemnity payment by us to utc for the ultimate amount due to the irs would constitute an adjustment to the purchase price and resulting goodwill of the ut automotive acquisition  if and when made  and would not be expected to have a material effect on our reported earnings 
we believe that valid support exists for utc s tax positions and intend to vigorously contest the irs s proposed adjustment 
however  the ultimate outcome of this matter is not certain 
american jobs creation act of in october  the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law 
the act creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate earnings from foreign subsidiaries by providing an dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations to the extent the dividends exceed a base amount and are invested in the united states pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan 
the temporary incentive is available to us in the amount of our dividends potentially eligible for the deduction is limited to million 
the deduction is subject to a number of limitations and uncertainty remains as to the interpretation of numerous provisions in the act 
the ustreasury department is in the process of providing clarifying guidance on key elements of the repatriation provision  and congress may reintroduce legislation that provides for certain technical corrections to the act 
we have not completed our evaluation of the repatriation provision due to the uncertainty associated with the interpretation of the provision  as well as numerous tax  legal  treasury and business considerations 
we expect to complete our evaluation of the potential dividends we may pursue  if any  and the related tax ramifications after additional guidance is issued 
significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
certain of our accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of 
table of contents revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these estimates and assumptions are based on our historical experience  the terms of existing contracts  our evaluation of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and suppliers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
actual results in these areas could differ from our estimates 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate would have had a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
pre production costs related to long term supply arrangements we incur pre production engineering  research and development er d and tooling costs related to the products produced for our customers under long term supply agreements 
we expense all pre production er d costs for which reimbursement is not contractually guaranteed by the customer 
in addition  we expense all pre production tooling costs related to customer owned tools for which reimbursement is not contractually guaranteed by the customer or for which the customer has not provided a non cancelable right to use the tooling 
during and  we capitalized million and million  respectively  of pre production er d costs for which reimbursement is contractually guaranteed by the customer 
during and  we also capitalized million and million  respectively  of pre production tooling costs related to customer owned tools for which reimbursement is contractually guaranteed by the customer or for which the customer has provided a non cancelable right to use the tooling 
during and  we collected million and million  respectively  of cash related to er d and tooling costs 
gains and losses related to er d and tooling projects are reviewed on an aggregate program basis 
net gains on projects are deferred and recognized over the life of the related long term supply agreement 
net losses on projects are recognized as costs are incurred 
a change in the commercial arrangements affecting any of our significant programs that would require us to expense er d or tooling costs that we currently capitalize could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
goodwill on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under this statement  goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to annual impairment analysis 
our impairment analysis compares the fair values of each of our reporting units  based on a discounted cash flow model  to the related net book values 
cash flows are estimated using internal budgets based on recent sales data  independent automotive production volume estimates and customer commitments  as well as assumptions related to discount rates 
changes in economic or operating conditions impacting these estimates and assumptions could result in the impairment of goodwill 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 we recorded impairment charges of million million after tax as of january  these charges are reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net of tax  in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  our annual sfas no 
impairment analysis was completed as of october   and there was no additional impairment 
as of december   we had billion of goodwill recorded 
an impairment charge related to this amount would not impact our cash flows but could materially and negatively affect our operating results 
long lived assets on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
accordingly  we monitor our long lived assets for impairment indicators 
if impairment indicators exist  we perform the required analysis and record impairment charges in accordance with sfas no 
in and  we recorded impairment charges of million and million  respectively  related to certain facility consolidations 
in  we also recorded impairment charges of million related to other facility closures  an early program termination and ongoing losses at certain of our facilities 
the 
table of contents estimated fair values were based upon either discounted cash flow analyses or estimated salvage values 
cash flows are estimated using internal budgets based on recent sales data  independent automotive production volume estimates and customer commitments 
changes in economic or operating conditions impacting these estimates and assumptions could result in the impairment of long lived assets 
we have certain other facilities that have generated operating losses in recent years 
the results of the related impairment analyses indicated that impairment of the fixed assets was not required 
we will continue to monitor the operating plans of these facilities for potential impairment 
legal and other contingencies we are subject to legal proceedings and claims  including product liability claims  commercial or contractual disputes  environmental enforcement actions and other claims  that arise in the normal course of business 
we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as ranges of probable losses  by consulting with internal personnel principally involved with such matters and with our outside legal counsel handling such matters 
we have accrued for estimated losses in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states for those matters where we believe that the likelihood that a loss has occurred is probable and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable 
the determination of the amount of such reserves is based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current matters and consultation with internal personnel principally involved with such matters and with our outside legal counsel handling such matters 
the reserves may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances 
the inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters can result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution 
revenue recognition and sales commitments we enter into agreements with our customers to produce products at the beginning of a vehicle s life 
although such agreements do not provide for minimum quantities  once we enter into such agreements  fulfillment of our customers purchasing requirements is our obligation for the entire production life of the vehicle 
these agreements generally may be terminated by our customer at any time 
historically  terminations of these agreements have been minimal 
in certain limited instances  we may be committed under existing agreements to supply products to our customers at selling prices which are not sufficient to cover the direct cost to produce such products 
in such situations  we recognize losses as they are incurred 
we receive blanket purchase orders from our customers on an annual basis 
generally  each purchase order provides the annual terms  including pricing  related to a particular vehicle model 
purchase orders do not specify quantities 
we recognize revenue based on the pricing terms included in our annual purchase orders as our products are shipped to our customers 
we are asked to provide our customers with annual cost reductions as part of certain agreements 
we accrue for such amounts as a reduction of revenue as our products are shipped to our customers 
in addition  we have ongoing adjustments to our pricing arrangements with our customers based on the related content and cost of our products 
such pricing accruals are adjusted as they are settled with our customers 
amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are included in net sales in our consolidated statements of income 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income 
in and in prior years  we recorded loss contract accruals in purchase accounting in conjunction with certain acquisitions 
these loss contract accruals were not recorded in the historical operating results of the acquired businesses 
the losses included in the accrual have not been  and will not be  included in our operating results since the respective acquisition dates 
further  our future operating results will benefit from 
table of contents accruing these contract losses in the related purchase price allocations 
a summary of the loss contract accrual activity related to these acquisitions is shown below in millions accrual as of original adjustments dec 
 accrual utilized lear donnelly ut automotive peregrine delphi we utilized million  million and million of the loss contract accruals to offset losses in  and  respectively 
income taxes in determining the provision for income taxes for financial statement purposes  we must make certain estimates and judgments 
these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
as of december   we have recorded valuation allowances of million for certain foreign tax jurisdictions 
we intend to maintain these allowances until it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
our future income tax expense will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances 
in addition  the calculation of our tax benefits and liabilities includes uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
we recognize tax benefits and liabilities based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
we adjust these liabilities based on changing facts and circumstances  however  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties and the impact of any tax audits  the ultimate resolutions may be materially different from our estimated liabilities 
use of estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
during  there were no material changes in the methods or policies used to establish estimates and assumptions 
generally  matters subject to estimation and judgment include amounts related to accounts receivable realization  inventory obsolescence  unsettled pricing discussions with customers and suppliers  warranty  pension and other postretirement benefit plan assumptions  facility consolidation and reorganization reserves  self insurance accruals  asset valuation reserves and accruals related to litigation  environmental remediation costs and income taxes 
actual results may differ from estimates provided 
recently issued accounting pronouncements pensions and other postretirement benefits the fasb issued a revised sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
this statement retains the original pension and other postretirement benefits disclosure requirements of sfas no 
and requires additional disclosures for both annual and interim periods 
all disclosures required by this statement have been reflected in note  pension and other postretirement benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements included in the report 

table of contents variable interest entities the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  the provisions of which apply immediately to any variable interest entity created after january   apply no later than the first period ending after december   to special purpose corporations  and apply in the first interim period ending after march   to any variable interest entity created prior to february  this interpretation requires the consolidation of a variable interest entity by its primary beneficiary and may require the consolidation of a portion of a variable interest entity s assets or liabilities under certain circumstances 
we adopted the requirements of fin no 
as of april  the effects of adoption were not significant 
contingently convertible debt the fasb ratified the final consensus of the emerging issues task force on eitf  the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share  which states that the impact of contingently convertible instruments that are convertible into common stock upon the achievement of a specified market price of the issuer s shares  such as our outstanding zero coupon convertible senior notes  should be included in diluted net income per share computations regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met 
accordingly  we have restated diluted net income per share for and to include the dilutive impact of our zero coupon convertible senior notes since the issuance date of february  inventory costs the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this statement clarifies the requirement that abnormal inventory related costs be recognized as current period charges and requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory conversion costs be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement are to be applied prospectively to inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the effects of adoption to be significant 
nonmonetary assets the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
apb opinion no 
 in general  requires the use of fair value as the measurement basis for exchanges of nonmonetary assets 
this statement eliminates the exception to the fair value measurement principle for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for nonmonetary asset exchanges that lack commercial substance 
the provisions of this statement are to be applied prospectively to nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not expect the effects of adoption to be significant 
stock based compensation the fasb issued a revised sfas no 
 share based payment 
this statement requires that all share based payments to employees be recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair value 
under previous guidance  companies had the option of recognizing the fair value of stock based compensation in the consolidated financial statements or disclosing the proforma impact of stock based compensation on the consolidated statement of income in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
for all employee awards issued after january  the revised statement is effective at the beginning of the first annual or interim period beginning after december   and provides two methods of adoption  the modified prospective method and the modified retrospective method 
we anticipate adopting the revised statement using the modified prospective method 
we are currently evaluating the provisions of the revised statement but do not expect the impact of adoption to be significant

risk factors a decline in automotive sales could reduce our sales and harm our profitability 
demand for our products is directly related to automotive vehicle production 
automotive sales and production can be affected by general economic or industry conditions  labor relations issues  regulatory requirements  trade agreements and other factors 
automotive production in north america and europe  our largest markets where most of our operations are located  has declined between and numerous factors beyond our control could lead to a further decline in automotive production in these markets 
automotive industry conditions in north america and europe continue to be challenging 
in north america  the industry is characterized by significant overcapacity  fierce competition and significant pension and healthcare liabilities for the domestic automakers 
north american automakers have recently announced production cuts which significantly impact several of our key platforms 
in europe  the market structure is relatively fragmented with significant overcapacity  and several of our key platforms have experienced production declines 
any decline in automotive production levels  particularly with respect to models for which we are a significant supplier  could reduce our sales and harm our profitability  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness or resulting in a decline in the value of our common stock 

table of contents the loss of business from a major customer could reduce our sales and harm our profitability 
general motors and ford  two of the largest automotive manufacturers in the world  together accounted for approximately of our net sales in  excluding net sales to opel  saab  volvo  jaguar and land rover  which are affiliates of general motors or ford 
inclusive of their respective affiliates  general motors and ford accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our net sales in in recent years  general motors and ford have experienced declining market shares in north america 
a loss of significant business from general motors or ford  including a loss of business resulting from a decline in the market share of either of these customers  would be harmful to our business and our profitability  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness or resulting in a decline in the value of our common stock 
in addition  no assurances can be given that we will be successful in expanding our business with asian automotive manufacturers 
the discontinuation of  the loss of business with respect to or a lack of commercial success of a particular vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could reduce our sales and harm our profitability 
although we have purchase orders from many of our customers  these purchase orders generally provide for the supply of a customer s annual requirements for a particular model and assembly plant  renewable on a year to year basis  rather than for the purchase of a specific quantity of products 
therefore  the discontinuation of  the loss of business with respect to or a lack of commercial success of a particular vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could reduce our sales and harm our profitability  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness or resulting in a decline in the value of our common stock 
our substantial international operations make us vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries 
as a result of our global presence  a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
in addition  we have manufacturing and distribution facilities in many foreign countries  including countries in asia  eastern and western europe and central and south america 
international operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad  including exposure to local economic conditions  expropriation and nationalization  foreign exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls  withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  investment restrictions or requirements  export and import restrictions  and increases in working capital requirements related to long supply chains 
expanding our business in asian markets and our business relationships with asian automotive manufacturers are important elements of our strategy 
in addition  our strategy includes expanding our manufacturing operations in lower cost regions 
as a result  our exposure to the risks described above may be greater in the future 
the likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable 
however  any such occurrences could be harmful to our business and our profitability  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness or resulting in a decline in the value of our common stock 
high raw material costs may continue to have a significant adverse impact on our profitability 
higher costs for certain raw materials  principally steel  resins and diesel fuel  had a significant adverse impact on our operating results in and will continue to negatively impact our profitability in 
table of contents while we have developed strategies to mitigate or partially offset the impact of higher raw material costs  we cannot assure you that such measures will be successful 
in addition  no assurances can be given that the magnitude and duration of these cost increases or any future cost increases will not have a larger adverse impact on our profitability and consolidated financial position than currently anticipated 
a significant labor dispute involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers or that could otherwise affect our operations could reduce our sales and harm our profitability 
most of our employees and a substantial number of the employees of our largest customers and suppliers are members of industrial trade unions and are employed under the terms of collective bargaining agreements 
virtually all of our unionized facilities in the united states and canada have a separate agreement with the union that represents the workers at such facilities  with each such agreement having an expiration date that is independent of other collective bargaining agreements 
collective bargaining agreements covering approximately of our unionized workforce of approximately  employees  including of our unionized workforce in the united states and canada  are scheduled to expire during a labor dispute involving us or any of our customers or suppliers or that could otherwise affect our operations  or the inability by us or any of our customers or suppliers to negotiate an extension of a collective bargaining agreement covering a large number of employees upon its expiration  could reduce our sales and harm our profitability  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness or resulting in a decline in the value of our common stock 
significant increases in labor costs as a result of the renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements could also be harmful to our business and our profitability 
adverse developments affecting one or more of our major suppliers could harm our profitability 
we obtain components and other products and services from numerous tier ii automotive suppliers and other vendors throughout the world 
in certain instances  it would be difficult and expensive for us to change suppliers of products and services that are critical to our business 
certain of our suppliers are financially distressed or may become financially distressed 
any significant disruption in our supplier relationships  including certain relationships with sole source suppliers  could harm our profitability  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness or resulting in a decline in the value of our common stock 
a significant product liability lawsuit  warranty claim or product recall involving us or one of our major customers could harm our profitability 
in the event that our products fail to perform as expected and such failure results in  or is alleged to result in  bodily injury and or property damage or other losses  we may be subject to product liability lawsuits and other claims 
in addition  we are a party to warranty sharing and other agreements with our customers related to our products 
these customers may seek contribution or indemnification from us for all or a portion of the costs associated with product liability and warranty claims  recalls or other corrective actions involving our products 
these types of claims could significantly harm our profitability  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness or resulting in a decline in the value of our common stock 
we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes  which could have an adverse impact on our profitability and consolidated financial position 
we are involved in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes that  from time to time  are significant 
these are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including  without limitation  commercial or contractual disputes  including disputes with our suppliers  intellectual property matters  personal injury claims and employment matters 
no assurances can be given that such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on our profitability and consolidated financial position 

table of contents we depend upon cash from our subsidiaries 
therefore  if we do not receive dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries  it could be more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness 
a substantial portion of our revenue and operating income is generated by our wholly owned subsidiaries 
accordingly  we are dependent on the earnings and cash flows of  and dividends and distributions or advances from  our subsidiaries to provide the funds necessary to meet our debt service obligations 
we utilize certain cash flows of our foreign subsidiaries to satisfy obligations locally 
our obligations under our primary credit facility and senior notes are currently guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries  but such guarantees may be released under certain circumstances
