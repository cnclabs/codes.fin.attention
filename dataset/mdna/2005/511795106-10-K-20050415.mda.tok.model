item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following summary together with the more detailed business information and consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this form k and annual report and in the documents that we incorporate by reference into this form k 
this document may contain certain forward looking information within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of this information involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
overview we manufacture and sell a comprehensive line of safety garments and accessories for the industrial protective clothing market 
our products are sold by our in house sales force and independent sales representatives to a network of over safety and mill supply distributors 
these distributors in turn supply end user industrial customers such as chemical petrochemical  automobile  steel  glass  construction  smelting  janitorial  pharmaceutical and high technology electronics manufacturers  as well as hospitals and laboratories 
in addition  we supply federal  state and local governmental agencies and departments such as fire and police departments  airport crash rescue units  the department of defense  central intelligence agency  federal bureau of investigation  us secret service and the centers for disease control 
our net sales attributable to customers outside the united states were million  million and million  in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our sales of limited use disposable protective clothing grew approximately in the year ended january  compared to the year ended january   and our expectation is to see continued growth 
we expect that distributors will continue to stock more inventory as economic conditions in the united states continue to improve 
we also expect our net sales to increase as we introduce our tyvek r based products into new industries in which the use of tyvek r is not widespread 
in addition  our net sales are driven in part by government funding and health related events 
our net sales attributable to chemical suits increased in the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  these sales increases were driven primarily by grants from the federal government under the fire act of and the bio terrorism preparedness and response act of as part of the homeland security initiatives 
during fiscal  as a result of the sars virus outbreak in various cities in  we sold approximately million of sars related garments in china  toronto  hong kong and taiwan 
the centers for disease control has recommended protective garments be used to protect healthcare workers in the fight against the spread of the sars virus 
in the event of future outbreaks of sars or other similar contagious viruses  such as avian flu in  we have positioned ourselves with increased production capacity 
we have operated manufacturing facilities in mexico since and in china since beginning in  we moved the labor intensive sewing operation for our limited use disposable protective clothing lines to these facilities 
our facilities and capabilities in china and mexico allow access to a less expensive labor pool than is available in the united states and permit us to purchase certain raw materials at a lower cost than they are available domestically 
as we have increasingly moved production of our products to our facilities in mexico and china  we have seen improvements in the profit margins for these products 
we are in the early stages of moving production of our reusable woven garments and gloves to these facilities and expect to complete this process by the third quarter of fiscal as a result  we expect to see profit margin improvements for these product lines as well 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base estimates on our past experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and we periodically evaluate these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we derive our sales primarily from our limited use disposable protective clothing and secondarily from our sales of high end chemical protective suits  fire fighting and heat protective apparel  gloves and arm guards  and reusable woven garments 
sales are recognized when goods are shipped to our distributors at which time title and the risk of loss passes 
sales are reduced for sales returns and allowances 
payment terms are generally net days for united states sales and net days for international sales 
inventories 
inventories include freight in  materials  labor and overhead costs and are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
provision is made for slow moving  obsolete or unusable inventory 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for accounts receivable that may not be collectible 
in establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze the collectibility of individual large or past due accounts customer by customer 
we establish reserves for accounts that we determine to be doubtful of collection 
income taxes and valuation reserves 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
this involves estimating the actual current tax in addition to assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments for tax and financial accounting purposes 
these differences  together with net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits  are recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities on our balance sheet 
a judgment must then be made of the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
a valuation allowance may be required to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we determine that we may not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  or that new estimates indicate that a previously recorded valuation allowance is no longer required  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset is charged or credited to net income in the period of such determination 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
on february   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which provides that goodwill and other intangible assets are no longer amortized  but are assessed for impairment annually and upon occurrence of an event that indicates impairment may have occurred 
goodwill impairment is evaluated utilizing a two step process as required by sfas no 
factors that we consider important that could identify a potential impairment include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the overall business strategy  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon one or more of these indicators of impairment  we measure any potential impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method 
estimating future cash flows requires our management to make projections that can differ materially from actual results 
in fiscal  as a result of our decision to move a portion of our reusable woven garment assembly from the united states to china  we reviewed this portion of our business for impairment 
an impairment was calculated based on estimating the fair value  utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis  resulting in an impairment charge of million 
we have no remaining goodwill recorded as of january  self insured liabilities 
we have a self insurance program for certain employee health benefits 
the cost of such benefits is recognized as expense based on claims filed in each reporting period and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported during such period 
our estimate of claims incurred but not reported is based upon historical trends 
if more claims are made than were estimated or if the costs of actual claims increases beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional accruals may be required in future periods 
we maintain separate insurance to cover the excess liability over set single claim amounts and aggregate annual claim amounts 
results of operations the following table set forth our historical results of operations for the years ended january   and as a percentage of our net sales 
year ended january  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses operating profit interest expense  net minority interest in net income of variable interest entities income tax expense net income significant balance sheet fluctuation january  as compared to january  balance sheet accounts 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and the decrease in the current portion of long term liabilities is the direct result of funds received from the company s secondary public offering and the payoff of our credit facility balance on june  accounts receivable increased due to increased sales 
inventories increased as we build our finished goods inventory for our seasonally strong fourth and first quarters for fiscal and we also built raw material reserves due to an anticipated increase in the cost of these raw materials 
plant property and equipment increased as a result of adopting fin r in which we recorded million of buildings in our consolidation of variable interest entities 
year ended january  compared to the year ended january  net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the january  year ended from million for the year ending january  the increase was due primarily to an increase in the sales of our chemical suits and also an increase in our core non woven disposable products line 
increased sales were also driven by an improving us economy which increased demand for our products  particularly in the industrial non woven disposable markets we serve  and increased demand for our chemical protective suits and fire turnout gear for homeland security purposes 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  gross profit as a percent of net sales increased to for the year ended january  from for the year ended january   primarily because of cost reductions achieved by shifting production of additional tyvek r based products and chemical suits to china and mexico and changes in the mix resulting from more sales of the higher margin chemical suits 
we have increasingly shifted and will continue to shift production to these lower cost facilities 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million  or to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  as a percent of net sales  operating expenses decreased to for the year ended january  from for the year ended january  the million increase in operating expenses in the year ended january  compare to the year ended january  was principally due to an increase in o salaries of million o freight of million o sales commissions of million o sales related expenses of million o insurance expense of 
million o currency fluctuations of million o licenses and fees of million o advertising expenses million o consulting fees of million pertaining to sarbanes oxley compliance o other 
million which above increases of million were offset by o a minority interest reclassification of million  leaving a net increase of million 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by 
million for the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  because we paid off our credit facility in full on june   from the proceeds of our secondary stock offering 
minority interest 
minority interest in net income of variable interest entities increased to 
million for the year ended january  as a result of our adoption on financial interpretation no 
r fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  effective february  subsequent to our adoption of fin r  we determined that certain entities from which we lease real property and which are partially owned by related parties are variable interest entities governed by fin r 
as a result  these entities have been consolidated in our statement of income for the year ended january  income tax expense 
income tax expenses consist of federal  state and foreign income taxes 
income tax expense increased 
million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  our effective tax rate was and for the year ended january  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate varied from the federal statutory rate of due primarily to lower foreign tax rates  inclusion of minority interest in net income of variable interest entities and utilization of a tax carryforward 
net income 
net income increased million or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  the increase in net income was the result of an increase in net sales primarily in the chemical suits and increased productivity as a result of shifts in production to our china facilities  partially offset by an increase in costs and expenses due to higher sales 
year ended january  compared to year ended january  net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  the increase was due primarily to an increase in our market share in our tyvek r based product lines as well as an increase in the price of these products beginning in may increased sales were also driven by an improving us economy which increased demand for our products  particularly in the industrial tyvek r markets we serve  and increased demand for our chemical protective suits and fire turnout gear for homeland security purposes 
in addition  as a result of the sars outbreak  we sold our products for the first time in domestic china  which amounted to million in the year ended january gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  gross profit as a percent of net sales increased to for the year ended january  from for the year ended january   primarily because of cost reductions achieved by shifting production of additional tyvek r based products and chemical suits to china and mexico 
we have increasingly shifted production to these lower cost facilities 
in addition  we increased the price of our tyvek r based products beginning in may  which contributed to an increase in our gross margins for these products 
in the year ended january   we also determined that a portion of our inventory was obsolete 
as a result  we wrote off million of inventory offsetting the factors contributing to an increase in gross profit discussed above 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  as a percent of net sales  operating expenses remained constant at for the year ended january  and the year ended january  the million increase in operating expenses in the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  was principally due to increased expenses corresponding to our increase in net sales  as well as impairment of goodwill of million 
this was offset by a decrease in bad debt expense of million in fiscal resulting from improvement in the us economy and a reorganization of our credit department 
interest expenses 
interest expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in average monthly borrowings under our credit facilities 
income tax expense 
income tax expense consists of federal  state and foreign income taxes 
income tax expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  the increase was due to a relative increase in our income recognized in the united states as compared to the income recognized in china  where income tax rates are lower 
our effective tax rate was and in the years ended january  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate varied from the federal statutory rate of due primarily to lower foreign tax rates 
net income 
net income increased million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  the increase in net income was the result of an increase in net sales and increased productivity as a result of shifts in production to our china facilities  partially offset by an increase in costs and expenses due to higher volumes of our products being sold 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows as of january  we had short term marketable securities and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million  an increase of million and million  respectively  from january  our primary sources of funds for conducting our business activities have been from cash flow provided by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities described below and the secondary stock offering completed in june we require liquidity and working capital primarily to fund increases in inventories and accounts receivable associated with our net sales and  to a lesser extent  for capital expenditures 
net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended january  was due primarily to net income from operations of million offset in part by a decrease in accounts payable of 
million  an increase in inventories of million  an increase in accounts receivable of 
million and an increase in minority interest liability of million 
net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended january  was due primarily to net income from operations of million and an increase in accounts payable of million  offset in part by an increase in inventories of million and an increase in accounts receivable of million 
net cash used in investing activities of million and million in the years ended january  and  respectively  was due to purchases of property and equipment 
ne t cash provided by financing activities in the years ended january  and was primarily attributable to payments and borrowings under our credit facilities and to the secondary offering in fiscal credit facilities we currently have two credit facilities o an million revolving credit facility  of which we had no borrowings outstanding as of april   and o a million revolving credit facility the availability of which reduces incrementally over its year term  of which we had no borrowings outstanding as of april  in november  we entered into a year million term loan which we repaid in full on march  our million revolving credit facility permits us to borrow up to the lower of million and a borrowing base determined by reference to a percentage of our eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
our million revolving credit facility expires on july   and the outstanding balance was paid in full on june  using the proceeds from our secondary stock offering 
borrowings under this revolving credit facility bear interest at the london interbank offering rate libor plus and were zero at january  as of april   we had million of borrowing availability under this revolving credit facility 
in january  we entered into a new year million revolving credit facility which expires on february  availability under this facility decreases from million by  each month over the year term and is also subject to the borrowing base limitation discussed above in connection with our million revolving credit facility 
borrowings under this revolving credit facility bear interest at libor plus 
we did not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility at january  as of april   we had million of borrowing availability under this revolving credit facility 
our credit facilities require that we comply with specified financial covenants relating to interest coverage  debt coverage  minimum consolidated net worth  and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
these restrictive covenants could affect our financial and operational flexibility or impede our ability to operate or expand our business 
default under our credit facilities would allow the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
our lenders have a security interest in substantially all of our assets to secure the debt under our credit facilities 
as of april   we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our credit facilities 
we believe that our current cash position of million  our cash flow from operations along with borrowing availability under our million revolving credit facility  as well as the expected renewal of our million revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated operating  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for at least the next months 
historically  we have been able to renew our primary credit facility on acceptable terms  but there can be no assurance that such financing will continue to be available or that any renewal will be on terms as favorable as our current facility 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures principally relate to purchases of manufacturing equipment  computer equipment  leasehold improvement and automobiles  as well as payments related to the construction of our facilities in china 
our facilities in china are not encumbered by commercial bank mortgages and thus chinese commercial mortgage loans may be available with respect to these real estate assets if we need additional liquidity 
we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately million to purchase our decatur alabama facilities and similar facilities adjacent to our new york corporate headquarters all currently rented for  annually and million for capital equipment primarily computer equipment and apparel manufacturing equipment in fiscal contractual obligations we had no off balance sheet arrangements at january  as shown below  at january   our contractual cash obligations totaled approximately million  including lease renewals entered into subsequent to january  payments due by period less than total year years years after years in thousands operating leases    real estate purchases   automobiles leased   revolving credit facility total    seasonality our operations have historically been seasonal  with higher sales generally occurring in february  march  april and may when scheduled maintenance occurs on nuclear  coal  oil and gas fired utilities  chemical  petrochemical and smelting facilities  and other heavy industrial manufacturing plants  primarily due to cooler temperatures 
sales decline during the warmer summer and vacation months  and generally increase from labor day through february with slight declines during holidays 
as a result of this seasonality in our sales  we have historically experienced a corresponding seasonality in our working capital  specifically inventories  with peak inventories occurring between september and march coinciding with lead times required to accommodate the spring maintenance schedules 
we believe that by sustaining higher levels of inventory  we gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
certain of our large customers seek sole sourcing to avoid sourcing their requirements from multiple vendors whose prices  delivery times and quality standards differ 
in recent years  due to increased demand by first responders for our chemical suits and fire gear  our historical seasonal pattern has shifted 
governmental disbursements are dependent upon budgetary processes and grant administration processes that do not follow our traditional seasonal sales patterns 
due to the size and timing of these governmental orders  our net sales  results of operations  working capital requirements and cash flows can vary between different reporting periods 
as a result  we expect to experience increased variability in net sales  net income  working capital requirements and cash flows on a quarterly basis 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires that the fair value of such equity instruments be recognized as an expense in the historical financial statements as services are performed 
prior to sfas no 
r  only certain pro forma disclosures of fair value were required 
the provisions of this statement are effective first interim reporting period that begins after june  if the company had included the cost of employee stock option compensation in our financial statements it would not have had a material effect on our net income for the years ended january    and in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
inventory costs 
this statement amends accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing and removes the so abnormal criterion that under certain circumstances could have led to the capitalization of these items 
sfas no 
requires that idle facility expense  excess spoilage  double freight and re handling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
sfas also requires that allocation of fixed production overhead expenses to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  management does not believe there will be a significant impact as a result of adopting this statement 
on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchange of non monetary assets  an amendment of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 which differed from the international accounting standards board s iasb method of accounting for exchanges of similar productive assets 
statement no 
replaces the exception from fair value measurement in apb no 
 with a general exception from fair value measurement for exchanges of non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
the statement is to be applied prospectively and is effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the company does not believe that sfas no 
will have a material impact on its results of operations or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation provides guidance with respect to the consolidation of certain entities  referred to as variable interest entities vie  in which an investor is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the vie s activities  or is entitled to receive a majority of the vie s residual returns 
this interpretation also provides guidance with respect to the disclosure of vies in which an investor maintains an interest but is not required to consolidate 
the provisions of the interpretation are effective immediately for all vies created after january   or in which we obtain an interest after that date 
in october  the fasb issued a revision to this pronouncement  fin r  which clarified certain provisions and modified the effective date from october  to march  for variable interest entities created before february  the company has adopted this pronouncement as of february  the two entities which lease property to the company and are owned by related parties  which were consolidated in our financial statements are river group holding co  llp and poms holding co 
ownership of these entities is held by directors and officers of lakeland 
under fin  it is likely that leases between an entity and its related parties would be considered a variable interest even if there is no residual value guarantee or purchase option 
the fasb staff s view is that these elements are implied in a related party lease even though they may not be explicitly stated in the lease agreement 
there are no variable interest entities in which we hold a variable interest but we are not primary beneficiary 
there are no collateralized assets related to the variable interest entity recorded at january  in december  the fasb issued a revised sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits to improve financial statement disclosures for defined benefit plans 
the company has adopted sfas no 
and disclosure requirements as described in note to the company s annual report on form k for the year ended january  interim disclosures of net pensions costs are not material 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  we seek to limit  to the extent possible  our non us dollar denominated purchases 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our purchases and sales in other countries 
to manage the volatility relating to foreign currency exchange rates  we seek to limit  to the extent possible  our non us dollar denominated purchases and sales 
in connection with our operations in china  we purchase a significant amount of products from outside of the united states 
however  our purchases in china are primarily made in chinese yuan  the value of which has been largely pegged to the us dollar for the last decade 
as a result  any currency risks related to these transactions are deemed to be immaterial to us as a whole 
our primary risk from foreign currency exchange rate changes is presently related to non us dollar denominated sales in canada and  to a smaller extent  in europe 
our sales to customers in canada are denominated in canadian dollars 
if the value of the us dollar increases relative to the canadian dollar  then our net sales could decrease as our products would be more expensive to our canadian customers because of the exchange rate change 
although our sales in china are denominated in the chinese yuan  because this currency has been largely pegged to the us dollar  our foreign currency exchange rate risk in china has been minimized 
at this time  we do not manage the foreign currency risk through the use of derivative instruments 
a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies would not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
as non us dollar denominated international purchases and sales grow  exposure to volatility in exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to our credit facilities  which have variable interest rates based upon the london interbank offered rate 
at january   we had no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities 
if the interest rate applicable to this variable rate debt rose in the year ended january   our interest expense would have increased and our income before income taxes would have decreased by less than
