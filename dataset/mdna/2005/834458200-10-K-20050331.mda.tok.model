our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements as a result of factors  including those discussed previously  under risk factors or in other parts of this annual report on form k 
corporate history somera communications  inc was formed in august and is incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware 
the predecessor company was somera communications  llc  which was formed in california in july in november  we raised approximately million in net proceeds from our initial public offering 
since that time  our common stock has traded on the nasdaq national market under the symbol smra 
business combinations in october  we acquired msi communications inc msi 
this acquisition enabled us to strengthen our product offering in data networking equipment and services  increased our national presence  and provided key personnel 
this transaction was accounted for as a purchase 
we paid million in cash  including acquisition costs  and issued  shares of our common stock 
in october  we completed the acquisition of the equipment and repair business of asurent technologies  inc asurent for million in cash  including acquisition costs 
the acquisition of asurent provided us with enhanced equipment repair capabilities  key personnel  and additional customer and supplier relationships 
in october  we acquired compass telecom  llc compass telecom to strengthen our services offerings  provide key personnel  and contribute additional customer relationships 
through this acquisition  somera developed or strengthened services offerings in the areas of equipment deployment services for installation  de installation and microwave deployment  as well as site development  network development  and e services 
we paid million in cash  including acquisition costs and another million in as a result of earn out obligations 
in addition  under the terms of the acquisition agreement  we were obligated to pay up to million in cash over the next three years as a result of a contingent earn out that was based on achieving future performance targets 
in november  we entered into an asset purchase agreement with two of the former owners of compass telecom  where we agreed to sell back to these former owners those service products that did not support or complement our equipment business  including site development  network development  and e services 
in consideration of the transfer of assets  we received  on february  for certain expenses incurred by somera on behalf of compass telecom and are due to receive of gross revenues of the newly formed entity through the payment related to gross revenues is scheduled to be settled in under the terms of the agreement  the former owners of compass telecom have relinquished their rights to receive all remaining earn out payments referred to above under their prior agreement with somera 
the financial results of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the dates of acquisition 
for further details about these acquisitions  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations compared to equipment revenue 
our equipment revenue consists of sales of new and re used telecommunications equipment  including switching  transmission  wireless  data  microwave and power products  net of estimated 
table of contents provision for returns 
equipment revenue decreased million  or to million in from million in equipment revenue attributable to new equipment sales decreased to million in from million in equipment revenue attributable to re used equipment sales decreased to million in from million in this decrease in equipment revenue was primarily the result of insufficient sales and supply account reach and penetration  shifts in market demand and price erosion 
industry consolidation in major north american accounts also impacted equipment sales as carriers delayed network build out schedules and legacy network maintenance agendas were reviewed 
this is directly reflected in the sales of our new and re used equipment as revenue from new equipment sales declined and re used equipment sales declined compared to as a result  equipment sales in the united states decreased million  or to million in from million in in  net equipment revenue from customers outside the united states decreased million  or  to million in from million in  largely due to employee turnover in early in our europe region 
service revenue 
service revenue for was primarily derived from repair contracts 
service revenue decreased million  or to million in from million in the decline in service revenue reflects our decision in the fourth quarter of to reduce the amount of low margin  low value added services products 
service revenue comprised of total revenues in compared to of total revenues in equipment cost of revenue 
our equipment cost of revenue consists of costs of equipment we purchase from third party sources  related freight charges  external handling costs  and write downs of existing inventory 
equipment cost of revenue decreased to million in from million in equipment cost of revenue attributable to new equipment sales decreased to million in from million in equipment cost of revenue attributable to re used equipment sales decreased to million in from million in the decrease in equipment cost of revenue during was primarily related to decreases in equipment sales volumes  increasing competition for certain older wireless technologies and by write downs of existing inventories 
provisions for excess and obsolete inventories decreased million to million in from million in subsequent to our consolidation of distribution centers to coppell  texas in  we completed a physical inventory in the third quarter of  and determined that million of inventory was damaged or missing 
improved inventory controls during reduced the amount of damaged or missing inventory to an immaterial amount 
we increased our inventory reserve in to million from million in to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to current market prices 
service cost of revenue 
service cost of revenue consists primarily of personnel costs for the related service business as well as parts and equipment we purchase from third party sources in respect of the performance of services 
during the fourth quarter of  we decided to de emphasize certain low margin and low value add services 
during  service cost of revenue largely consisted of time and material for services outsourced to third party entities 
service cost of revenue decreased million  or  to million in from million in as a result of our decision to deemphasize certain services as discussed above 
equipment gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of equipment revenue  or gross margin  was  or million  in compared to  or million in gross margin as a percentage of revenue attributable to new equipment sales increased to in compared to in gross margin attributable to re used equipment sales decreased to  or million  in from  or million  in the reduction in the re used equipment gross margin was primarily related to a million transaction in with a strategic national wireless carrier at no gross profit 
sourcing constraints caused us to deliver a large portion of new equipment instead of re used equipment to meet the customer s schedules 
the decrease in total gross margin was also partially attributable to increased competition 

table of contents service gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of service revenue increased to  or million  in compared to  or million in the increase in gross profit on service revenue was primarily attributed to our decision in the fourth quarter of to de emphasize certain low margin and low value add services  dispose of the assets related to compass telecom and a decision to invest in certain services activities and rebalance our services offering to meet market trends 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of sales personnel salaries  commissions and benefits  costs for marketing support to establish the somera brand and augment sales strategies as well as costs associated with sales and marketing materials and promotions 
sales and marketing expenses decreased million to million or of net revenue in compared to million or of net revenue in the primary decrease in sales and marketing expenses was due to lower salaries  which decreased approximately million in as compared to resulting from a decline in the number of sales staff throughout the year 
in addition  commission expense decreased  as a result of lower sales levels as compared to in addition  rent expense also decreased  as compared to general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of facility costs including distribution and technical operations  salary and benefit costs for executive and administrative personnel  and professional fees 
general and administrative expenses decreased million to million  or of net revenue  in compared to  which was million  or of net revenue 
the decrease in general and administrative expense from to is due to a reduction in general and administrative headcount by persons during as a result of rebalancing efforts during the year 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses from to included a decrease of  in salary expense and  in outside labor costs due to the consolidation of our distribution and technical operations to coppell  texas in bonus expense also decreased  compared to due to staffing changes during the year and due to a decline in revenue 
further  bad debt expense decreased  health and general insurance costs decreased  due to lower headcount throughout the year and renegotiated terms on our policies  communications expenses decreased  relocation expenses decreased  and depreciation expense decreased  from these decreases in general and administrative expense were offset by an increase in consulting expenses of million  an increase of  in accounting expenses  and  in tax and license expense in as compared to these increases resulted from expenses related to strategy and training programs as well as costs incurred in connection with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
during  we also incurred a  loss on disposal of fixed assets 
restructuring charges and asset impairment 
restructuring charges in relate to our annual impairment review of goodwill as required under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this analysis considered the estimated fair value of our three reporting units new equipment  re used equipment  and services based on market capitalization  as implied by the value of our common stock and estimated discounted future cash flows 
we determined that the carrying values of two reporting units services and re used equipment exceeded their respective fair values 
accordingly  we compared the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with their carrying values and recorded a pre tax impairment charge of approximately million in in the second quarter of  the company completed its annual impairment analysis of goodwill 
consistent with the annual impairment analysis conducted in  we utilized a discounted cash flow model to perform our annual impairment analysis of goodwill 
we reviewed the estimated fair value of the new equipment reporting unit based on the related discounted cash flows and compared the implied fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
as the carrying value did not exceed the fair value of the reporting unit  we determined that the current goodwill of approximately million related to new equipment was not impaired 
during the second quarter of  we also completed an impairment review of our long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
based on this review  we determined that certain intangible assets could not be recovered from their undiscounted cash 
table of contents flows 
accordingly  in the second quarter we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of approximately  to write down these assets to their estimated fair values 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced and began implementation of our operational restructuring plan to reduce operating costs and streamline our operating facilities 
continuing lease obligations primarily relate to closure of the oxnard  california  norcross  georgia  and euless  texas facilities 
amounts expensed represent estimates of undiscounted future cash outflows  offset by anticipated third party sub leases 
at december   we remain obligated under lease obligations of  associated with our december operational restructuring 
the lease obligations expire in termination benefits are comprised of severance related payments for all employees to be terminated in connection with the operational restructuring 
termination benefits do not include any amounts for employment related services prior to termination 
at december   the accrued liability associated with the restructuring charge was  and consisted of the following in thousands balance at december  payments balance at december  lease obligations  net of estimated sublease income amortization of intangible assets 
intangible assets subject to amortization consist of customer contracts and non compete covenants related to our acquisitions during   and which were amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated economic lives 
amortization of intangible assets decreased to  in from  in as a result of our june impairment analysis  we reduced the carrying value of certain intangible assets  which in turn decreased our amortization expense 
amortization expense in the first quarter of included amortization expense related to customer contracts acquired from the compass telecom and asurent technologies acquisitions  which were fully amortized by the end of no similar impairment was required in other income  net 
other income  net  consists of investment earnings on cash and cash equivalent balances and realized foreign currency gains losses 
other income  net  remained consistent year over year at  in compared to  in interest income in was million compared to  in realized foreign currency gains losses in were a loss of  compared to  in income tax provision benefit 
in we had an income tax provision of  with an effective tax rate of  compared to a provision of million in with an effective rate of 
the income tax provision for represents estimates of taxes due on income earned by our foreign subsidiaries 
the income tax benefit generated by our losses in north america was offset by an increase in our valuation allowance 
under generally accepted accounting principles  we must establish valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be recovered 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  both positive and negative evidence must be considered 
it was determined that our cumulative losses reported in and represented significant negative evidence which required a full valuation allowance to be recorded 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non cash charge of million in the fourth quarter of to establish a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
compared to equipment revenue 
substantially all of our equipment revenue consisted of sales of new and re used telecommunications equipment  including switching  transmission  wireless  data  microwave and power products  net of estimated provision for returns 
equipment revenue decreased to million in from million in the decrease in equipment revenue was primarily driven by a decrease in new equipment sales  in conjunction with a decrease in re used equipment sales 
equipment revenue from customers in the united states decreased to million from million  primarily due to reduced 
table of contents new equipment sales 
in  all revenue from customers outside of the united states consisted of equipment sales 
net revenue from customers outside of the united states increased to million in from million in due to the expansion of our international operations  primarily in europe 
our expansion in europe was partially offset by decreases in our asiapacific and latin america regions 
equipment revenue attributable to new equipment sales decreased to million in from million in the decrease in new equipment net revenue was impacted significantly by oem actions in to aggressively discount their current generation products and or extend their terms to customers  to reduce their inventories and to meet their quarterly financial sales expectations 
the result of these actions was to make it more feasible for operators  our customers  to purchase new equipment directly from the oem  rather than purchasing from us 
additionally  another factor which caused the decline in new equipment revenues was the impact of our microwave equipment  which was our largest new equipment product category in the equipment we sold in this category was reaching the end of its lifecycle 
finally  as a result of the financial distress in the telecommunications industry  customer purchasing behavior changed  which reduced customers demand for new equipment  thus contributing to the decline in new equipment sales in equipment revenue attributable to re used equipment sales decreased to million in from million in the decrease in equipment revenue attributable to re used equipment sales was primarily due to two events 
the primary reason for the decline was oems aggressively discounted current generation products to reduce inventories to meet quarterly expectations  which  in turn  put downward pricing pressure on re used equipment 
further  oems engaged in aggressive programs to counter the secondary market through right to use licenses and enforcement of existing volume purchase agreements with telecommunications operators 
in addition  our sourcing activity throughout was less aggressive than in previous years 
as we re organized purchasing responsibilities and guidelines to reflect market conditions  there was a period where we were conservative and did not source enough product to fulfill demand 
service revenue 
service revenue for was primarily derived from deployment ie  installation de installation  microwave support and maintenance ie repair contracts 
service revenue decreased to million in from million in service revenues declined primarily due to customers postponement of network build outs due to their budget constraints 
equipment cost of revenue 
substantially all of our equipment cost of revenue consisted of the cost of equipment we purchase from third party sources  related in bound and out bound freight costs  and associated external handling costs 
equipment cost of revenue decreased to million in from million in the decrease in equipment cost of revenue during this period was primarily attributable to decreases in our equipment volumes with respect to new equipment sales 
equipment cost of revenue attributable to new equipment sales decreased to million in from million in equipment cost of revenue attributable to re used equipment sales decreased to million in from million in the decrease in re used equipment cost of revenue was proportionate to the decline in re used equipment net revenue 
service cost of revenue 
service cost of revenue primarily consisted of time and materials of our project managers and invoices for services outsourced to third party entities 
service cost of revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in service cost of revenue was primarily attributable to increased costs of providing services due to our acquisition of compass telecom 
prior to the compass telecom acquisition  virtually all of our services were outsourced to third party vendors and the cost of services was primarily third party vendor costs 
with the acquisition of compass telecom  our service product offering increased and many contracts were completed with internal resources or with a combination of internal resources and outside vendors 
these additional service offerings in conjunction with repair revenues  of which most are outsourced at low margins  was the primary reason for the increase in service cost of revenues 
equipment gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of equipment revenue remained fairly consistent year over year at in compared to in although we experienced a decrease in re used 
table of contents equipment margins  the decrease was offset by a change in the mix of new and re used equipment as our sales of new equipment  which have lower margins  decreased significantly year over year 
gross margin attributable to new equipment sales remained fairly consistent year over year at in compared to in gross margin attributable to re used equipment sales decreased to in from in the decrease in gross margin attributable to re used equipment sales was due primarily to insufficient inventory management controls 
we believe that effective and appropriate inventory management controls have been put in place to ensure ongoing proper inventory management 
service gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of service revenue decreased to in compared to in the decrease in gross profit on service revenue was primarily attributable to the decrease in service revenue and a shift in the mix between higher margin service products  such as various deployment services to lower margin service products  such as repair specific maintenance services 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consisted primarily of salaries  commissions and benefits for sales  marketing and procurement employees as well as costs associated with advertising and promotions 
a majority of our sales and marketing expenses were incurred in connection with establishing and maintaining long term relationships with a variety of operators 
sales and marketing expenses decreased million to million or of net revenue in compared to million or of net revenue in the primary decrease in sales and marketing was due to commissions  which decreased approximately million due to a decrease in gross margin 
in addition  salaries expense decreased million from due to a decline in sales headcount of during this decrease was offset by severance expense of approximately  general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consisted principally of salary and benefit costs for executive and administrative personnel  professional fees and facility costs including distribution and technical operations 
general and administrative expenses remained constant year over year at million  or of net revenue  in compared to  which was million  or of net revenue 
the slight increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue from to included a decrease of million in salary expense due to reduced general and administrative headcount of during  and depreciation expense  which decreased million 
these decreases in general and administrative expenses were offset by increases in consulting expense of million due to sarbanes oxley compliance and a tax consulting project  increases in health and workers compensation insurance of  and increases in accounting expenses of  restructuring charges and asset impairment 
during the second quarter of  we completed our annual impairment review of goodwill as required under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this analysis considered the estimated fair value of our three reporting units new equipment  re used equipment  and services based on market capitalization  as implied by the value of our common stock and estimated discounted future cash flows 
we determined that the carrying values of two reporting units services and re used equipment exceeded their respective fair values 
accordingly  we compared the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with their carrying values and recorded a pre tax impairment charge of approximately million 
during the second quarter of  we also completed an impairment review of our long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
based on this review  we determined that certain intangible assets could not be recovered from their undiscounted cash flows

net cash used by operating activities for was million 
the primary use of operating cash was the reported net loss of million  which was offset by non cash charges of million related to the provision for excess and obsolete inventories and depreciation and amortization charges of million 
the increase in inventory was due to an increase in reserves during due to changing demand levels due to consolidation within the telecommunications industry 
significant sources of operating cash flows included a decrease in accounts receivable of million  and a decrease in income tax receivable of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to decreasing revenue 
the decrease in income tax receivable results from a tax refund of million that was received in the third quarter of offsetting these operating cash flows was a million increase in inventory  a million decrease in accounts payable  a  decrease in accrued compensation  and a  decrease in deferred revenue 
as a result of our past purchase of used equipment for which demand did not materialize  the company also increased inventory reserves during the decrease in accounts payable results from lower inventory levels throughout the year 
the decrease in accrued compensation is a function of the change in staffing levels in 
table of contents as compared to the decrease in accrued compensation is also due to lower accrued commissions at the end of due to lower revenue levels 
net cash provided by operating activities in was  the primary use of operating cash was the reported net loss of million  which was offset by non cash charges of million related to impairment of goodwill and million related to the write off of our deferred tax assets

net cash generated by operating activities in was million 
the primary increase in net cash provided by operating activities was a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
we saw over a million decline in net revenues in the fourth quarter 
decreasing revenues and continued focus on cash collection caused the accounts receivable balance to decrease significantly over the prior year 
the inventory provision increased by million  primarily due to a million increase in the inventory reserve taken in the fourth quarter in the fourth quarter  we experienced a significant decline in market demand over the previous quarter and continued to see increased pricing pressures 
increases in our operating activities were offset by a million decrease in accounts payable  million increase in inventories and a million decrease in income taxes payable

table of contents critical accounting policies we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  warranty reserves  sales return reserves  valuation allowances  valuation of goodwill and intangible assets  and income taxes to be critical policies 
revenue recognition 
our revenues are derived from the sale of new and re used telecommunications equipment and equipment related services 
with the exception of equipment exchange transactions  whereby equipment from one operator s network is taken in exchange for other equipment  equipment revenue is recognized upon delivery  provided that at the time of delivery  there is evidence of a contractual arrangement with the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  and there are no significant remaining obligations 
delivery occurs when title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  generally at the time the product is shipped to the customer 
we also generate service revenue  either in connection with equipment sales or through service only transactions 
revenue on time and materials contracts is recognized as services are rendered at contract labor rates plus material and other direct costs incurred 
revenue on fixed price contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of total costs incurred to date compared to estimated total costs to complete the contract 
estimates of costs to complete include material  direct labor  overhead  and allowable general and administrative expenses 
these estimates are reviewed on a contract by contract basis  and are revised periodically throughout the life of the contract such that adjustments to profit resulting from revisions are made cumulative to the date of the revision 
the full amount of an estimated loss is charged to operations in the period it is determined that a loss will be realized from the contract 
revenue earned but not yet billed is reflected as unbilled receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
unbilled receivables were   and  at december   and  respectively 
revenue from services represented approximately   and  of total revenue for the fiscal years ended december    and  respectively 
revenue for transactions that include multiple elements such as equipment and services bundled together is allocated to each element based on its relative fair value based on negotiated terms or in the absence of fair value  the residual method and recognized when the revenue recognition criteria have been met for each element 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the following criteria are satisfied undelivered elements are not essential to the functionality of delivered elements  uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved  and the fair value for all undelivered elements is known 
revenue is deferred when customer acceptance is uncertain  when significant obligations remain  or when undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered products 
we manage contracts whereby we pay for services rendered by third parties acting as agents for our customers 
we pass these expenses through to customers  who reimburse us for the expenses plus a management fee 
revenues related to these types of contracts are from management fees received from customers 
we supply equipment to companies in exchange for new or re used equipment or to companies from which re used equipment was purchased under separate arrangements executed within a short period of time reciprocal arrangements 
for reciprocal arrangements  the company considers accounting principles board apb no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 nonmonetary transactions magnitude of boot and exceptions to the use of fair value  and interpretation of apb no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
revenue is recognized when the equipment received in accordance with the reciprocal arrangement is sold through to a third party 
revenues recognized under reciprocal arrangements were  million  and million for the fiscal years ended december    and  respectively 
warranty reserve 
we generally accrue for estimated future warranty expenses for equipment sales upon product delivery  and any additional amounts are recorded when such costs are probable and can be reasonably 
table of contents estimated 
the equipment warranties generally carry a one year warranty from the date of delivery 
longer warranty periods are provided on a very limited basis in instances where the original equipment manufacture oem warranty is longer or it is a requirement to sell to a specific customer or market 
accordingly  our estimated warranty expenses are determined based on historical information such as past experience  product failure rates or number of units repaired  estimated cost of material and labor per claim  and in certain instances  estimated property damage 
the warranty reserve is expensed to cost of goods sold and is included in other accrued liabilities 
actual claims incurred in the future may differ from original estimates  which may result in material revisions to the warranty reserves 
at december  and  the reserve for warranty obligations was million and  respectively 
sales returns reserve 
as part of our revenue recognition policy  we estimate future product returns and establish reserves against revenue at the time of sale based on our historical return rate 
the returns reserve is recorded against revenue and is included as a reduction of accounts receivable 
actual results could differ from those estimates  which could affect our operating results 
at december  and  the reserve for sales returns was  and  respectively 
valuation allowances 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
specifically  we make estimates of doubtful accounts in accounts receivable  slow moving and obsolete inventory  and realizability of deferred tax assets 
these estimates are made based on a consideration of various factors  including historical experience  knowledge of customers and the telecommunications equipment market  and current economic trends 
actual results could differ from those estimates  which could affect our operating results 
at december   the estimated reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventory was million 
our inventory reserve methodology consists of reviewing all inventory items items for sales history or activity and reserving as a partial or full impairment as needed 
during the year ended december  we recorded an million increase to the inventory reserve  resulting from continued weakness in the telecommunications industry and changes in our business strategy  as well as our past purchase of used equipment for which demand did not materialize 
as of december   net inventory was lower than as of december  reserves were million on million of gross inventory at december  versus million in reserves on million in inventory at december  the decrease in inventory was due to reduced purchasing activity and cost controls as a response to telecommunications industry consolidations that affected equipment products 
at december   the estimated reserve for doubtful accounts was  we review our accounts receivable detail and specifically identify any customers for which indicators of impairment exist and record a specific doubtful accounts reserve for these balances 
additionally  we estimate a general reserve for bad debts based on historical write offs as a percentage of sales 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on management estimates and assumptions 
generally accepted accounting principles requires that we establish a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be recovered 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider both positive and negative evidence to support the recoverability of the deferred tax asset 
we determined that our cumulative recurring losses in recent years represented significant negative evidence  which indicated the need for a full valuation allowance to be recorded 
as such  we took a charge of million to write off our deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of in  we increased the valuation allowance by million  primarily as a result of additional net operating loss carryforwards generated in the current year as we 
table of contents continue to provide for a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets 
we will record valuation allowances against any future deferred tax assets resulting from tax benefits for future losses 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 
the cost of acquired companies is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
costs allocated to identifiable intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining estimated useful lives of the assets  as determined by underlying contract terms or appraisals 
such lives range from one to three years 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends 
if we determine that the carrying value of goodwill and other identified intangibles may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would typically measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we accounted for the acquisition of the assets of compass telecom llc  completed after july   under the new guidance  and on january   we ceased to amortize goodwill arising from the msi communications  inc and asurent technologies  inc 
acquisitions  which were completed prior to july  we were required to perform a transitional impairment review of our goodwill prior to june  and an impairment review at least annually thereafter 
in june  we completed our annual goodwill and purchased intangibles impairment tests outlined under sfas no 
 which required the assessment of goodwill and purchased intangibles for impairment as of june  these tests were conducted by determining and comparing the fair value of our reporting units  as defined in sfas no 
 to the reporting unit s carrying value as of that date 
based on the results of these impairment tests  we determined that our goodwill assets for two of our three reporting units were impaired as of june  and a million write down to goodwill was taken 
based on the impairment of goodwill  we then performed a sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  impairment test on the purchased intangible assets and determined they were impaired as of june  subsequently  we completed a write down to the purchased intangible assets of  in june of  we completed our annual impairment analysis of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
consistent with the annual impairment analysis conducted in  we utilized a discounted cash flow model to perform our annual impairment analysis of goodwill 
we reviewed the estimated fair value of the new equipment reporting unit based on the discounted cash flows and compared the implied fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
as the carrying value did not exceed the fair value of the reporting unit  we determined that the current goodwill outstanding of approximately million related to new equipment was not impaired 
the goodwill balances at december  and were million 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the emerging issues task force eitf amended and ratified previous consensus reached on eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain issues 
this amendment  which was originally effective for financial periods beginning after june   introduced 
table of contents qualitative and quantitative guidance for determining whether securities are other than temporarily impaired 
in september  the financial accounting standards board s fasb staff issued a number of positions fsp that focused primarily upon the application of eitf to debt securities that are impaired solely due to interest rates and or sector spreads 
subsequently  fasb suspended the effective date of the application of the majority of eitf for an unspecified period  pending additional review 
in the interim  we continue to apply earlier authoritative accounting guidance to the measurement and recognition of other than temporary impairments of its debt and equity securities 
in october  the emerging issues task force eitf ratified its consensus on issue no 
 applying paragraph of fasb statement no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  in determining whether to aggregate operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds 
eitf no 
addresses how an enterprise should evaluate the aggregation criteria of sfas no 
when determining whether operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds may be aggregated in accordance with sfas no 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
will be effective for fiscal periods beginning after march  we are currently in the process of determining the impact of eitf on our financial results 
the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law by the us president on october  the act contains numerous changes to us tax law  both temporary and permanent in nature  including a potential tax deduction with respect to certain qualified domestic manufacturing activities  changes in the carryback and carryforward utilization periods for foreign tax credits and a dividend received deduction with respect to accumulated income earned abroad 
the new law could potentially have an impact on our effective tax rate  future taxable income and cash and tax planning strategies  amongst other affects 
in december  the fasb issued staff position no 
fsp  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of and staff position no 
fsp  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp clarifies that the manufacturer s tax deduction provided for under the ajca should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with sfas no 
and not as a tax rate reduction 
fsp provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer as provided for in the ajca 
we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact that the act will have on our financial position and results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs sfas  which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material 
sfas will be effective for inventory costs incurred beginning january  we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
sfas requires exchanges of productive assets to be accounted for at fair value  rather than at carryover basis  unless neither the asset received nor the asset surrendered has a fair value that is determinable within reasonable limits or the transactions lack commercial substance 
sfas is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  share based payment  which replaced sfas no 
and superceded apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values in the first interim or annual period beginning after june  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no 
will no longer be an 
table of contents alternative to financial statement recognition 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
r in the third quarter of fiscal year  beginning july  under sfas no 
r  we must determine the appropriate fair value method to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method of compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation cost be recorded for all unvested stock options and nonvested stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas no 
r  whereas the retroactive method requires recording compensation cost for all unvested stock options and nonvested stock beginning with the first period restated 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas no 
r and expect that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material impact on our results of operations and earnings per share 
we have not yet determined the method of adoption of sfas no 
r  or whether the amounts recorded in the consolidated statements of income in future periods will be similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas no 

table of contents risk factors certain factors that may affect future operating results you should carefully consider the risks described below 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially harmed and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
you should also refer to other information contained in this annual report on form k  including our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
our operating results are likely to fluctuate in future periods  which might lead to reduced prices for our stock 
our annual or quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of numerous factors  many of which are outside of our control 
if our annual or quarterly operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the trading price of our stock could significantly decline 
factors that could impact our operating results include the rate  timing and volume of orders for the telecommunications infrastructure equipment and services we sell  the rate at which telecommunications operators de install their equipment  decreases in our selling prices due to competition in the secondary market  price pressure from oems or other competitors  our ability to obtain products cost effectively from oems  distributors  operators and other secondary sources of telecommunications equipment  our ability to provide equipment and service offerings on a timely basis to satisfy customer demand  variations in customer capital spending patterns due to seasonality  economic conditions for telecommunications operators and other factors  write offs due to inventory defects or obsolescence  the sales cycle for equipment and services we sell  which can be relatively lengthy  especially as it relates to our lifecycle management services offering  delays in the commencement of our operations in new market segments and geographic regions  costs relating to possible acquisitions and integration of new businesses  and delays or concerns resulting from or related to completed and or impending consolidation of telecommunications operators 
our business depends upon our ability to match third party re used equipment supply with telecommunications operators demand for this equipment and failure to do so could reduce our net revenue or increase our expenses 
our success depends on our continued ability to match the equipment needs of telecommunications operators with the supply of re used equipment available in the secondary market 
we depend upon maintaining business relationships with third parties who can provide us with re used equipment and information on available re used equipment 
failure to effectively manage these relationships and match the needs of our customers with available supply of re used equipment could damage our ability to generate net revenue 
in the event operators decrease the rate at which they de install their networks  choose not to de install their networks at all  or choose to sell or otherwise provide re used equipment to others  it would be more difficult for us to locate this 
table of contents equipment  which could negatively impact our net revenue 
alternatively  if we do not adequately match supply by making equipment purchases in anticipation of sales to our customers that do not materialize prior to the decline in market value of such inventory or obsolescence of such inventory  this could result in higher costs to us in the form of future inventory write downs 
a continued downturn and or consolidation in the telecommunications industry or an industry trend toward reducing or delaying additional equipment purchases due to cost cutting and other pressures could reduce demand for our products 
we rely significantly upon customers concentrated in the telecommunications industry as a source of net revenue and re used equipment inventory 
in  and  we experienced a general downturn in the level of capital spending by our telecommunications customers for the products and services we sell 
this slow down in capital spending could result in postponement of network upgrades and reduced sales to our customers 
there can be no assurance that the level of capital spending in the telecommunications industry or by our customers specifically will increase or remain at current levels  or generate future net revenue levels at which our business would be profitable in future periods 
the market for supplying equipment and services to telecommunications operators is competitive  and if we cannot compete effectively  our net revenue and gross margins might decline 
competition among companies who supply equipment and services to telecommunications operators is intense 
we currently face competition primarily from four sources oems  distributors  secondary market dealers and telecommunications infrastructure support services companies who sell new and re used telecommunications infrastructure equipment and services 
if we are unable to compete effectively against our current or future competitors  we may have to lower our selling prices and may experience reduced gross margins and loss of market share  either of which could harm our business 
competition is likely to increase as new companies enter our market  as current competitors expand their products and services  as our competitors consolidate  and as our customers develop internal capabilities 
increased competition in the secondary market for telecommunications equipment could also heighten demand for the limited supply of re used equipment  which would lead to increased prices for  and reduce the availability of  this equipment 
any increase in these prices could significantly impact our ability to maintain our gross margins 
we do not have many formal relationships with suppliers of telecommunications equipment and may not have access to adequate product supply 
in fiscal year  of our net revenue was generated from the sale of re used telecommunications equipment 
typically  we do not have supply contracts to obtain this equipment and are dependent on the de installation of equipment by operators to provide us with much of the equipment we sell 
our ability to buy re used equipment from operators  distributors and secondary market dealers is dependent on our relationships with them 
if we fail to develop and maintain these business relationships with operators or they are unwilling to sell re used equipment to us  our ability to sell re used equipment will suffer 
in addition  in  one supplier accounted for of our equipment purchases 
if we are unable to continue to purchase a significant portion of our equipment from this supplier  then our equipment costs could increase  thereby adversely impacting our operating results 
our customer base is concentrated and the loss of one or more of our key customers would have a negative impact on our net revenue 
historically  a significant portion of our sales has been to relatively few customers 
sales to our ten largest customers accounted for of our net revenue in  of our net revenue in  and of our 
table of contents net revenue in no single customer accounted for at least of our net revenue in or in in addition  substantially all of our sales are made on a purchase order basis  and we do not have long term purchasing agreements with customers 
we face a further risk that consolidation among our significant customers  such as the recently completed acquisition of at t wireless by cingular wireless  and the recently announced acquisitions of at t by sbc communications  mci by verizon communications or qwest communications  nextel by sprint  and western wireless by alltell  could result in more customer concentration and fewer sales opportunities that would adversely impact our net revenue 
as a result  we cannot be certain that our current customers will continue to purchase from us 
the loss of  or any reduction in orders from  a significant customer would have a negative impact on our net revenue 
we may be forced to reduce the sales prices for the equipment and services we sell  which may impair our ability to maintain our gross margins 
in the future  we expect to reduce prices in response to competition and to generate increased sales volume 
in and  some manufacturers reduced their prices of new telecommunications equipment 
if manufacturers reduce the prices of new telecommunications equipment  we may be required to further reduce the price of the new and re used equipment we sell 
if we are forced to reduce our prices or are unable to shift the sales mix towards higher margin equipment and service sales  we will not be able to maintain current gross margins 
the market for re used telecommunications equipment and telecommunications equipment lifecycle services is relatively new and it is unclear whether our equipment and service offerings and our business will achieve long term market acceptance 
the market for re used telecommunications equipment and telecommunications equipment lifecycle services is relatively new and evolving  and we are not certain that our current or potential customers will adopt and deploy re used telecommunications equipment in their networks or purchase the telecommunications equipment lifecycle services we offer 
for example  with respect to re used equipment that includes a significant software component  potential customers may be unable to obtain a license or sublicense for the software 
even if they do purchase re used equipment  our potential customers may not choose to purchase re used equipment from us for a variety of reasons 
our customers may also re deploy their displaced equipment within their own networks or perform the services we offer internally  which would eliminate their need for our equipment and service offerings 
these internal solutions would also limit the supply of re used equipment available for us to purchase  which would limit the development of this market 
further  we have found that the sales cycle for our recently developed equipment lifecycle services offering is protracted due to the fact that this offering is new and involved multiple layers of our customers organizations 
if we are unable to successfully sell our equipment lifecycle service offering to our customers or if the sales cycle for these services continues to be protracted  our business could suffer 
we may fail to continue to attract  develop and retain key management and sales personnel  which could negatively impact our business 
we depend on the performance of our executive officers and other key employees 
the loss of key members of our senior management or other key employees could negatively impact our operating results and our ability to execute our business strategy 
for example  in april  we announced the appointment of david w 
heard as our president and chief executive officer 
in addition  in december  our vice president and chief financial officer  c 
stephen cordial and our vice president of sales  glenn o brien  left our company 
further we depend on our sales professionals to serve customers in each of our markets 
the loss of key sales professionals could significantly disrupt our relationships with our customers 
we do not have key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
our future success also depends on our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
competition for employees in the telecommunications equipment and services industry is intense 
additionally  
table of contents we depend on our ability to train and develop skilled sales people and an inability to do so would significantly harm our growth prospects and operating performance 
our business may suffer if we are not successful in our efforts to keep up with a rapidly changing market 
the market for the equipment and services we sell is characterized by technological changes  evolving industry standards  changing customer needs and frequent new equipment and service introductions 
our future success in addressing the needs of our customers will depend  in part  on our ability to timely and cost effectively respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes  develop our internal technical capabilities and expertise  broaden our equipment and service offerings  and adapt our services to new technologies as they emerge 
our failure in any of these areas could harm our business 
moreover  any increased emphasis on software solutions as opposed to equipment solutions could limit the availability of re used equipment  decrease customer demand for the equipment we sell  or cause the equipment we sell to become obsolete 
the lifecycles of telecommunications infrastructure equipment may become shorter  which would decrease the supply of  and carrier demand for  re used equipment  and telecommunications equipment lifecycle services  and which could increase our expenses 
our sales of re used equipment and services depend upon telecommunications operator utilization of existing telecommunications network technology 
if the lifecycle of equipment comprising operator networks is significantly shortened for any reason  including technology advancements  the installed base of any particular model of equipment would be limited 
this limited installed base would reduce the supply of  and demand for  re used equipment and services we offer  which could decrease our net revenue 
additionally  to the extent that lifecycles for telecommunications equipment are shortened  equipment we hold in anticipation of future sales may  to an accelerating degree  become less valuable or obsolete and subject to an inventory write down  which would increase our cost of sales levels 
many of our customers are telecommunications operators that may at any time reduce or discontinue their purchases of the equipment and services we sell to them 
if our customers choose to defer or curtail their capital spending programs  it could have a negative impact on our sales to those telecommunications operators  which would harm our business 
a significant portion of our customers are emerging telecommunications operators who compete against existing telecommunications companies 
these new participants only recently began to enter these markets  and many of these operators are still building their networks and rolling out their services 
they require substantial capital for the development  construction and expansion of their networks and the introduction of their services 
if emerging operators fail to acquire and retain customers or are unsuccessful in raising needed funds or responding to any other trends  such as price reductions for their services or diminished demand for telecommunications services in general  then they could be forced to reduce their capital spending programs 
if we fail to implement our strategy of purchasing equipment from and selling equipment and services to regional bell operating companies  our business will suffer 
one of our strategies is to develop and expand our relationships with regional bell operating companies  or rbocs 
we believe the rbocs could provide us with a significant source of additional net revenue 
in addition  we believe the rbocs could provide us with a large supply of re used equipment 
we cannot assure 
table of contents you that the implementation of this strategy will be successful 
rbocs may not choose to sell re used equipment to us or may not elect to purchase this equipment or services from us 
rbocs may instead develop those capabilities internally or elect to compete with us and resell re used equipment to our customers or prospective customers or competitors 
if we fail to successfully develop our relationships with rbocs or if rbocs elect to compete with us  our revenue levels could suffer 
if we do not expand our international operations our business could suffer 
we intend to expand our business in international markets 
this expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources to develop a successful international business  including sales  procurement and support channels 
following this strategy  we opened our european headquarters in the fourth quarter of however  we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for the equipment and services we sell  and therefore we might not be able to expand our international operations 
our experience in providing equipment and services outside the united states is increasing  but still developing 
sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for million  or  of our net revenue in  million  or  of our net in  and million  or  of our net revenue in if we do engage in selective acquisitions  we may experience difficulty assimilating the operations or personnel of the acquired companies  which could threaten our future growth 
if we make acquisitions in the future  we could have difficulty assimilating or retaining the acquired companies personnel or integrating their operations  equipment or services into our organization 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
moreover  our profitability may suffer because of acquisition related costs  impairment of goodwill  or amortization of acquired other intangible assets 
furthermore  we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities in any future acquisitions 
the issuance of equity securities would be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
defects in the equipment we sell or failure to perform services at a high level of performance may seriously harm our credibility and our business 
telecommunications operators require a strict level of quality and reliability from telecommunications equipment and service suppliers 
telecommunications equipment is inherently complex and can contain undetected software or hardware errors 
if we deliver telecommunications equipment with undetected material defects  or if we perform services at lower than expected quality levels  our reputation  credibility and sales could suffer 
moreover  because the equipment we sell is integrated into our customers networks  it can be difficult to identify the source of a problem should one occur 
the occurrence of such defects  errors or failures or failure to perform services adequately could also result in delays in installation  product returns  product liability and warranty claims and other losses to us or our customers 
in some of our contracts  we have agreed to indemnify our customers against liabilities arising from defects in the equipment or services we sell to them 
furthermore  we supply most of our customers with warranties that cover the equipment and services we offer 
while we may carry insurance policies covering these possible liabilities  these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted 
a material product liability claim  whether successful or not  could be costly  damage our reputation and distract key personnel  any of which could harm our business 
our strategy to outsource services could impair our ability to deliver our equipment on a timely basis 
while we have expanded our services capability  we still currently depend on  to a large degree  third parties for a variety of equipment related services  including engineering  warehousing  repair  transportation  logistics  testing  installation and de installation 
this outsourcing strategy involves risks to our business  including reduced control over delivery schedules  quality and costs and the potential absence of adequate capacity 
in the event that any significant subcontractor was to become unable or unwilling to continue to perform their required 
table of contents services  we would have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements 
this process could be lengthy  and we cannot be sure that additional sources of third party services would be available to us on a timely basis  or at all 
our quarterly net revenue and the price of our stock may be negatively impacted by the seasonal purchasing patterns of our customers 
our quarterly net revenue may be subject to the seasonal purchasing patterns of our customers  which may occur as a result of our customers annual budgetary  procurement and sales cycles 
if our quarterly net revenue fails to meet the expectations of analysts due to those seasonal fluctuations  the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected 
our ability to meet customer demand and the growth of our net revenue could be harmed if we are unable to manage our inventory needs accurately 
to meet customer demand in the future  we believe it is necessary to maintain or increase some levels of inventory 
failure to maintain adequate inventory levels in these products could hurt our ability to make sales to our customers 
in the past  we have experienced inventory shortfalls on certain high demand equipment  and we cannot be certain that we will not experience such shortfalls again in the future  which could harm our ability to meet customer demand 
further  rapid technology advancement could make portions of our existing inventory obsolete and cause us to incur losses 
in addition  if our forecasts lead to an accumulation of inventories that are not sold in a timely manner  our business could suffer 
the corruption or interruption of key software systems we use could cause our business to suffer if it delays or restricts our ability to meet our customers needs 
we rely on the integrity of key software and systems 
specifically we rely on our relationship management database which tracks information on currently or potentially available re used equipment 
this software and these systems may be vulnerable to harmful applications  computer viruses and other forms of corruption and interruption 
in the event any form of corruption or interruption affects our software or systems  it could delay or restrict our ability to meet our customers needs  which could harm our reputation or business 
if we are unable to meet our additional capital needs in the future  we may not be able to execute our business growth strategy 
we currently anticipate that our available cash resources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
however  our resources may not be sufficient to satisfy these requirements 
we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings to take advantage of business opportunities  including more rapid international expansion or acquisitions of complementary businesses  develop and maintain higher inventory levels  gain access to new product lines  develop new services  or respond to competitive pressures 
any additional financing we may need might not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our business could suffer if the inability to raise this funding threatens our ability to execute our business growth strategy 
moreover  if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage of ownership of our current stockholders will be 
table of contents reduced 
newly issued equity securities may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of investors in our common stock 
in addition  the terms of any debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
we face the risk of future non recurring charges in the event of impairment 
we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  beginning in january and  as a result  we no longer amortize goodwill 
however  we will continue to have amortization related to other purchased intangibles  and we must evaluate our intangible assets  including goodwill  at least annually for impairment 
in june  we completed our annual goodwill impairment test and determined that our goodwill was not impaired and no impairment charge was necessary 
in the fourth quarter of  we reviewed the future realizability of our deferred tax assets 
we determined that our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income was uncertain 
as such  we took a charge of million to write off all of our short and long term deferred tax assets 
in  we increased the valuation allowance by million  primarily as a result of additional net operating loss carryforwards generated during the current year as we continue to provide for a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
new regulations related to equity compensation could adversely affect our operating results and affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel 
since our inception  we have used stock options as an important component of our employee compensation packages 
we believe that our stock option plan is an essential tool to link the long term interests of our stockholders and employees  and serve to motivate management to make decisions that will  in the long run  give the best returns to stockholders 
the financial accounting standards board fasb has implemented changes to united states generally accepted accounting principles that require us to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants  as well as other equity based awards 
the changes implemented by fasb relating to the accounting for equity compensation plans are scheduled to go into effect in mid this accounting pronouncement will negatively impact our operating results and could affect our ability to raise capital on acceptable terms 
for an illustrative example of the adverse impact this accounting change may have had on our recent operating results  please see note summary of significant accounting policies stock based compensation to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
to the extent that new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees  we may incur increased compensation costs  change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  each of which could materially and adversely affect our business 
our facilities could be vulnerable to damage from earthquakes and other natural disasters 
our office in carpinteria  california  is located on or near known earthquake fault zones and our facilities worldwide are vulnerable to damage from fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures and similar events 
if a disaster occurs that impacts our headquarters and execution and delivery center in texas or our offices in the netherlands  our ability to test and ship the equipment we sell would be seriously  if not completely  impaired  and our inventory could be damaged or destroyed  which would seriously harm our business 
we cannot be sure that the insurance we maintain against fires  floods  earthquakes and general business interruptions will be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case 
our officers and directors exert significant influence over us  and may make future business decisions with which some of our stockholders might disagree 
our executive officers  directors and entities affiliated with them beneficially own an aggregate of approximately of our outstanding common stock as of january  as a result  these stockholders will be able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control 

table of contents failure to comply with all of the requirements imposed by section of the sarbanes oxley act of could result in a negative market reaction 
as directed by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  the securities and exchange commission adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on our internal control over financial reporting in our annual reports on form k 
this report is required to contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
in addition  the independent registered public accounting firm auditing a public company s financial statements must attest to and report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of the our internal controls over financial reporting 
while we have expended and continue to expend significant resources in complying with section  there is a risk that we will not be able to comply with all of the requirements imposed by section further  if we fail to implement required new or improved controls  we may be unable to comply with the requirements of section if such actions were to occur  we cannot predict how the market or regulators will react 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk we have reviewed the provisions of financial reporting release no 
disclosure of accounting policies for derivative commodity instruments and disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information about market risks inherent in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments 
we had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at december  in addition  we do not engage in hedging activities 
a significant amount of our revenue and capital spending is denominated in us dollars 
we invest our excess cash in short term  money market certificates of deposits and other securities 
due to the short time the investments are outstanding and their general liquidity  our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments do not subject the company to a material interest rate risk 
as of december   we had no long term debt outstanding 
as a significant amount of our revenue  purchases and capital spending is denominated in us dollars  a strengthening of the us dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
this risk could become more significant as we expand business outside the united states 
as an international company  we conduct our business in various currencies and are therefore subject to market risk for changes in foreign exchange rates 
the company s primary exchange rate exposure is with the euro against the us dollar 
during  net revenue earned outside the united states accounted for of total revenue 
as a result  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk resulting from foreign currency denominated transactions with customers  suppliers and non us subsidiaries
