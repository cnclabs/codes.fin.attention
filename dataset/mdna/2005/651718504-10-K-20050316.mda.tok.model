item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
operating environment and recent developments our operating results depend in large measure on oil and gas drilling activity levels in the markets we serve  as well as on the depth of drilling  which governs the revenue potential of each well 
these levels  in turn  depend on oil and gas commodities pricing  inventory levels and product demand 
rig count data is the most widely accepted indicator of drilling activity 
key average rig count data for the last five years ending december is listed in the following table us rig count newpark s primary gulf coast market newpark s primary market to total canadian rig count derived from baker hughes incorporated our primary gulf coast market includes south louisiana land  texas railroad commission districts and  louisiana and texas inland waters  and offshore gulf of mexico 
in addition to our primary gulf coast market  we operate in several other key markets including canada  the us central region including the us rocky mountain region  oklahoma and west texas and areas surrounding the mediterranean sea 
key market developments revenues by key markets are as follows dollars in millions years ended december  gulf coast oilfield us central canada mediterranean other total vs 
vs 
gulf coast oilfield us central canada mediterranean other total our primary gulf coast market accounted for approximately of revenues  compared to as recently as the decline in the percentage of gulf coast revenues is the 
table of contents result of growth in most other market revenues relative to flat gulf coast market activity during as compared to the us central region  composed of the us rocky mountains  oklahoma and west texas  accounted for approximately of revenues  compared to in revenue growth in is primarily associated with the increase in rig activity and an increase in market share 
the increase in market share is principally related to demonstrated satisfactory performance for our customers in the field and growing acceptance of our high performance water based proprietary drilling fluids products 
the canadian market accounted for approximately of revenues  compared to in the year over year decline is due to a reduction in services provided to a major customer and to adverse weather conditions in the markets we serve in canada 
much of the drilling activity in canada has historically been conducted when winter temperatures freeze the soil and stabilize it  allowing safe access 
our mediterranean operations were acquired in may these operations accounted for approximately of revenues as compared to approximately in the year over year decline in revenue for the mediterranean operations is principally related to the effect of a decline in the us dollar on euro denominated contracts and the completion of several contracts 
during  we focused the management of these operations on improving margins rather than increasing revenues 
other market trends current short term industry forecasts suggest that we could see a slight increase in the number of rigs active in our primary gulf coast market  but this increase is expected to develop slowly as customers react to the changing risk profile of the market 
the number of rigs active in the offshore and inland water gulf coast markets is expected to increase slowly due to a lack of available rigs of adequate capability 
we anticipate continued revenue growth in the markets we serve  driven by increased market penetration of critical  deep water and geologically deeper wells 
this market penetration is the result of our performance and continued success of new products  including our deepdrill and flexdrill families of products 
current long term industry forecasts anticipate difficulty in meeting growing demand for natural gas  predicated upon improving economic conditions 
in addition  current gas reserves are being depleted at a rate faster than replacement through current drilling activities 
many shallow fields in the gulf coast market have been heavily exploited 
improved economics and technology have increased the interest of producers to drill at greater depths to reach the larger gas reserves 
we expect gas drilling activity to be increasingly associated with deeper  more costly wells 
we view this trend as favorable to demand for product offerings in all of our segments 
recent product and other developments over the last several years we have developed several new products and product enhancements in each of our business segments 
we have invested a significant amount of financial and human resources in developing these new products 
a large portion of these investments in product developments and enhancements have been made during an extended period of market stagnation or decline  primarily in the gulf coast market 
we believe that these investments will be a key driver in our anticipated growth in fluids sales and engineering 
we continue to develop a niche in the drilling fluids market by expanding our customer base  drawing upon increasing acceptance of our proprietary deepdrill technology 
we have recently expanded on this technology by introducing the flexdrill system that draws from the technology introduced in the deepdrill system several years ago 
flexdrill 
table of contents allows the key components of the system to be added to the fluid as the well progresses  reducing total system cost and simplifying the fluid management process 
this product line extension has been well received  and we anticipate that  as our gulf coast customers increase their activity levels  flexdrill will become a significant part of our revenue mix in that market 
we have introduced the new oil based drilling fluid system that incorporates a principal component from the deepdrill family to replace salt  which solves some of the environmental problems associated with oil based fluids while improving drilling performance 
we believe that these new products will make it easier for our customers to comply with increasingly strict environmental regulations affecting their drilling operations and improve the economics of the drilling process 
during we experienced increases in our product costs across most of the us markets that we serve 
specifically  we experienced significant increases in the cost of barite from our foreign suppliers as a result of increased shipping costs 
these cost increases were not offset by price increases to our customers in due to market conditions and existing contractual arrangements 
we are presently in the process of implementing a to price increase to our customers as contracts are renewed 
we anticipate that this price increase will be fully implemented in mat and integrated services 
we continue to develop the worldwide market for our dura base composite mat system 
our marketing efforts for this product continue to be focused in nine key markets  including canada  alaska and the arctic  russia  the middle east  south america  mexico  indonesia  the us military and the us utilities markets 
we now have completed sales in all of these key markets 
over the past several years of marketing this product and evaluating customer acceptance  we have gained valuable information and have begun to modify our marketing and product development strategies accordingly 
we have determined that for several of our markets  the current sales price and the long term life of the dura base mat do not fit well with the short term nature of customer projects or the unique budgetary constraints of governmental customers 
as a result  we are pursuing more rental opportunities outside of the company s traditional oilfield base 
these new markets include infrastructure construction applications  particularly for maintenance and upgrades of electric utility transmission lines in response to increasing demand for electricity in many parts of the country  and for other infrastructure construction applications and temporary roads for movement of oversized or unusually heavy loads 
we initially believed that the dura base mat would eventually replace a significant portion of our traditional wooden mats in many applications and provide significant economic benefits because the dura base mats are lighter  stronger  require fewer repairs and last longer than our wooden mats 
because we receive better rates and terms from using the dura base mats in non oilfield markets  we have now begun redeploying those mats to new market opportunities  reducing the quantity available in the oilfield market 
in addition  we have sold some of the used dura base mats to customers outside of our oilfield market area 
we continue to provide wooden mats to the gulf coast oilfield and western canada markets 
these wooden mats are becoming more difficult to obtain due to dwindling supplies of hardwoods 
we believe that our access to hardwoods through our batson mill operations gives us a competitive advantage 

table of contents we have recently begun marketing the first production run of our new lightweight bravo mat system and believe that it will substantially broaden the opportunities in mat sales in this new mat system has been designed specifically for personnel applications by the us military  including walkways and tent flooring  but is likely to have many other applications 
beginning in late  we implemented cost reduction measures in the mat and integrated services segment 
these cost reduction measures principally related to resizing our rental fleet  reductions in infrastructure  outsourcing transportation and other services and related payroll reductions 
in addition to these cost reduction measures  we anticipate reductions in our depreciation costs  primarily in the second half of  due to the completion of depreciation on portions of our wooden mat fleet for which we do not intend to fully replace with new wooden mats 
e p waste disposal 
we continue to enter new markets for our environmental services as opportunities arise 
during the third quarter of we opened a disposal facility serving wyoming s jonah pinedale trend  and we have already committed to an expansion of that facility 
each geographic area has its unique challenges with respect to environmental matters  and we continue to meet these challenges by developing and applying new and innovative technologies 
as noted above we anticipate a recovery in the primary gulf coast market in based on current indications of increased activity in the offshore  inland water and land markets 
we do not anticipate that the increase in revenues the gulf coast market for e p waste would be as significant as anticipated increases in our other business segments 
we have recently announced the formation of newpark environmental water solutions  llc news  through which we intend to commercialize a proprietary and patented water treatment technology 
the new technology removes dissolved solids from the wastewater before it is introduced into conventional treatment processes  rendering those processes much more effective and economical 
we expect initial revenues for news in the second quarter of the principal markets that we initially intend to pursue with this technology are the jonah pinedale field in wyoming  coalbed methane markets in the us rockies and surrounding areas and the oil sand markets in western canada where significant volumes of waste water are produced

as a result of this change  the operating results for the environmental services business unit in canada is now reported as a component of the e p waste disposal segment rather than as a component of the fluids sales and engineering segment 
in addition  a portion of costs of revenues of the canadian business unit is now reported as a component of g a expenses

the average number of rigs operating in this region increased  from rigs in to in the difference between the increase in the number of rigs serviced in this region and the number of rigs active in the region reflects our market penetration 
the difference between the increase in revenues and the increase in the number of rigs serviced in these markets also reflects the expansion of our product offerings in this market 
revenues in the canadian market declined during  as compared to  due to a reduction in services provided to a major customer  while average rig activity in the canadian market remained relatively stable period to period 
in addition  our principle market areas within canada experienced extreme weather related declines as compared to the prior year and as compared to other areas in the canadian market as a whole 
revenues in the mediterranean market declined during  as compared to this year over year decline in revenue is principally related to the effect of a decline in the us dollar on euro denominated contracts and the completion of several contracts 
as noted above  beginning in  we focused on improving margins for these operations rather than increasing revenues

installation re rental total us oilfield mat rental non oilfield mat rentals integrated services and other canadian operations composite mat sales total mat rental volume for totaled million square feet at an average price of per square foot 
this compares to million square feet at an average of per square foot in during  we transitioned our canadian mat operations to a sales organization for wooden and composite mats 
all of the canadian revenue for was related to sales of wooden and composite mats  while revenue for included rental and sales revenues 
during  we recognized approximately million in composite mat sales 
during this period we sold approximately  dura base composite mats  resulting in million in revenues  and we sold approximately  bravo mats  resulting in approximately  in revenues

integrated services and other revenues  our lowest margin business unit for this segment  includes a comprehensive range of environmental services necessary for our customers oil and gas exploration and production activities 
these revenues also include the operations of our sawmill in batson  texas 
during the past four years  we have sold approximately  mats into nine targeted markets worldwide 
some of these markets will remain sales markets  while others will become rental markets over time 
based on market data gathered in  we believe there is a significant rental opportunity in support of expanding exploration and development activity in mexico 
as a result  we opened a new business unit in that country in the first quarter of we are the majority owner of the business and the mexican principals who are assisting us in development of the market holding a minority interest 
operating income fluids sales and engineering operating income for this segment increased million in on a million increase in revenues as compared to the operating margin for this segment in was as compared to in the increase in operating margin was primarily attributable to operating leverage related to the significant growth in the us central region 
partially offsetting the impact of revenue growth in this region was the decline in canadian revenue related to severe weather conditions in the second quarter of operating margins in for this segment have been impacted by increased pricing for barite  principally due to increased transportation costs for bulk shipments of barite from our suppliers 
we are in the process of increasing our barite prices to customers and expect the effects of the raw material cost increase to be offset over the next several quarters 
in addition to the increase in barite costs  margins for the gulf coast market were negatively impacted by the impact of the severe tropical weather in the third quarter 
e p waste disposal waste disposal operating income declined million in on a million decline in revenues as compared to contribution increases from non gulf coast markets did not fully offset the volume related decline in the premium priced gulf coast oilfield market  which was partially due to severe tropical weather in the third quarter of in addition  fuel and transportation expenses increased significantly beginning in the second quarter of as compared to the prior year 
mat and integrated services mat and integrated services operating income increased million in on a million increase in revenues as compared to most of the increase in operating income is attributable to the significant increase in composite mat sales in  which have higher margins than other products and services in this segment 
in addition  the fourth quarter of benefited from cost reduction efforts principally related to resizing our rental fleet  reductions in infrastructure  outsourcing transportation and other services and related payroll reductions 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased million to approximately million in as compared to the majority of the increase is due to million of litigation costs related to recently settled litigation  net of amounts recoverable from insurance policies 
in addition  general and administrative expense increased approximately  as a result of new corporate governance and compliance related expenses and approximately  due to start up costs 
table of contents related to our new joint venture in mexico 
increased insurance and personnel costs accounted for the remaining increase in general and administrative expense 
provision for uncollectible accounts provisions for uncollectible accounts were recorded in the fourth quarters of and the provision recorded in resulted from a reassessment of potential losses for all customers in bankruptcy proceedings 
the provision recorded in relates principally to the collectibility of two receivable balances from customers that were in bankruptcy proceedings and was based upon adverse developments in those proceedings 
the majority of the customer balances associated with the provisions made in and were included in the assets of the fluids sales and engineering segment 
impairment losses we recorded an impairment loss of million in the fourth quarter of due to the other than temporary impairment of an investment in convertible  redeemable preferred stock of a company that owns thermal desorption technology 
the company in which we had invested suffered an adverse judgment in a patent case and filed for protection under chapter bankruptcy proceedings 
in the fourth quarter of  the company was forced into conversion of its chapter proceedings to chapter bankruptcy proceedings by the plaintiff 
with no access to its equipment and the related operating cash flows due to this conversion  the company had to cease its operations in the fourth quarter of though our investment remains collateralized by equipment  an impairment loss was recorded as the recovery of our investment is considered remote due to the impact of the chapter proceedings and other actions taken by the plaintiff during the fourth quarter 
at december   this investment was reported in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet and was not included in the assets of our reportable segments 
the impairment loss in related to our evaluation of the net realizable value of assets at our old barite grinding facilities in channelview  texas that will be completely abandoned after the relocation of these facilities is completed in the underlying assets were included in the assets of the fluids sales and engineering segment 
foreign currency exchange gains net foreign currency gains totaled  in as compared to  in the principal components of foreign currency gains in the prior year were realized and unrealized gains on short term intercompany payable balances of our canadian operations due to the significant decline in the us dollar against the canadian dollar in these intercompany balances are denominated in us dollars 
in  the net foreign currency gains were also associated with weakening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar and the associated impact on these same intercompany balances 
interest income interest income totaled million in  as compared to  in during we collected the entire balance owed on a note receivable in connection with the sale of a former shipyard operation 
the payment included all interest accruable on the note receivable 
we had stopped accruing interest on the note receivable in january due to the financial condition of the operator 
included in interest income for is  of previously unaccrued interest related to the note receivable 

table of contents interest expense interest expense of million declined  from the prior year amount of million 
the decline is principally related to lower total cost of our revolving credit facility 
during the first quarter of  we restructured our bank credit facility  which reduced the effective interest rate on our revolving facility by approximately one percent 
provision for income taxes for  we recorded an income tax provision of million  reflecting an income tax rate of 
for  we recorded an income tax provision of million  reflecting an income tax rate of 
the prior year effective tax rate reflected a higher mix of foreign income  which is taxed at higher rates than domestic income  and from the level of non deductible business expenses in relation to low pretax income

during  we received million barrels of e p waste  compared to million barrels in the increase in waste volumes received exceeded the increase in gulf coast market rigs active during the comparable periods 
we believe this is an indication of the impact from the new discharge limitations on synthetic based fluids that became fully effective in august the average revenue per barrel declined  to  as compared to an average of in  as a result of changes in the mix of waste streams received 
norm revenues declined in due to a decline in event driven projects 
mat and integrated services total revenue for this segment consists of the following for and dollars in millions vs 
installation re rental total gulf coast mat rental integrated services and other canadian operations composite mats total average rental pricing for the mat rental market increased to per square foot in from per square foot in  an increase of 
the highly competitive pricing in this market experienced in and began to subside in the fourth quarter as a result of lower mat inventories throughout the industry 
the volume of mat installations increased to million square feet in as compared to million square feet in  an increase of 
re rental income ie  revenues related to our customer s extension of agreements beyond the initial contractual period increased due to the continued trend to longer duration installations resulting from increased well depth 
integrated services and other revenues  our lowest margin business unit for this segment  includes a comprehensive range of environmental services necessary for our customers oil and gas exploration and production activities 
these revenues also include the operations of our sawmill in batson  texas 
the increase in revenues is principally associated with an increase in revenues at our sawmill 
the operations of our sawmill are approximately break even 
the principal reason for the increase in canadian revenue was the sale of the majority of the wooden mat rental inventory in without significant margin contribution 
these sales  which totaled million  were made in keeping with the strategic shift to become a seller of both wood and composite mats to regional service companies in the geographically diverse canadian market 

table of contents during  we sold approximately  dura base composite mats  resulting in million in revenues  and we sold approximately  bravo mats  resulting in approximately  in revenues  as compared to million of revenue on approximately  dura base composite mats sold in operating income fluids sales and engineering operating income from fluids sales and engineering declined  or  in as compared to operating margins for this segment declined from in to in the decline in operating margin principally reflects the decline in gulf coast revenues and the resulting operating loss for this business unit and continued market development costs in that added new customers during in addition  the operating margin declined as a result of an increase in lower margin revenue from the mediterranean and north african markets associated with the ava acquisition 
the effects of the operating loss for the gulf coast business unit and the lower operating margin in our mediterranean operations were not fully offset by operating profit increases in the other drilling fluids business units 
e p waste disposal operating income for this segment increased million  or  on a million  or  increase in revenues 
the significant increase in operating margin as compared to the increase in revenues is principally due to cost reduction measures implemented beginning in late and completed by june  the cost reductions included  among other things  our decision not to exercise our option to renew a disposal agreement with us liquids beyond the june  expiration date 
with the termination of this agreement and completion of other cost reduction measures  operating margins for this segment improved significantly beginning in the third quarter of mat and integrated services operating income for this segment declined by million to  for the year 
this decline in operating income in spite of the increase in revenues is due to higher marketing and operating costs  principally associated with composite mats  and changes in the mix of revenues in as compared to declines in composite mat sales revenue were offset by increases in sales of wooden mats from our rental inventory in canada and an increase in integrated services revenues with insignificant operating margin contribution 
provision for uncollectible accounts the provision for uncollectible accounts was recorded in the fourth quarter of and relates principally to receivable balances from two customers that are in bankruptcy proceedings and was based upon adverse developments in those proceedings 
these customer balances were included in the assets of the fluids sales and engineering segment 
impairment losses the impairment loss was recorded in the fourth quarter and relates to our evaluation of the net realizable value of assets at our old barite grinding facilities in channelview  texas that will be completely abandoned after the relocation of these facilities is completed in the underlying assets were included in the assets of the fluids sales and engineering segment 
foreign currency exchange gains net foreign currency gains were  in as compared to  in the principal components of this increase were realized and unrealized gains on short term intercompany payable balances of our canadian operations due to the significant decline in the us dollar against the canadian dollar in 
table of contents interest income and interest expense net interest expense was million for  an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the increase in net interest cost is principally due to the absence in of the million benefit recorded in from an interest rate swap arrangement settled on july  interest expense was also higher in compared to the prior year due to an increase of million in average outstanding borrowings  principally associated with a temporary year end draw of million to secure a letter of credit arrangement as further discussed in liquidity and capital resources 
the increase in the average outstanding borrowings was partially offset by a decline in the average effective interest rate from in to in  exclusive of the effect of the swap 
the decrease in the effective interest rate resulted from the general decline in interest rates experienced during and  which were offset in part by higher pricing spreads on our credit facility due to lower earnings and the corresponding reduction in our debt coverage ratios 
provision for income taxes we recorded income tax expense of million in and million in this equates to of pre tax income in and of pre tax income in the higher effective tax rate in results principally from the higher mix of foreign income to total consolidated income and from the level of non deductible business expenses in relation to low pre tax income 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital position was as follows as of december working capital s current ratio during the year ended december   our working capital position increased million 
offsetting this increase were the effects of an million reduction in restricted cash which had been used to secure a letter of credit obligation at december  net of the effect of the restricted cash item  working capital increased by million  with approximately million of this growth associated with an increase in inventories at december  as compared to december  the increase in inventory is principally related to increased barite ore  which is needed to meet the demand for that key raw material of our drilling fluids segment and to effectively manage the long lead logistics of overseas sourcing 
net trade accounts receivable increased  during on a million increase in revenues 
during  days sales in receivables declined by thirteen days to days from days in we continue to monitor our accounts receivable positions and have made working capital management a primary focus for our management 
we anticipate that our working capital requirements for will increase as a result of the expected improvement in revenue 
some of this expected increase in working capital requirements should be offset by our continued focus on improving our collection cycle and anticipated reductions in composite mat inventory 
however  we have the ability to supplement our operating cash flows with borrowings under our credit facility to fund the expected increase in working capital 
we believe we have adequate capacity under our credit facility to meet these anticipated working capital needs 

table of contents cash generated from operations during totaled million 
this cash  along with million of collections on notes receivable  including the second quarter collection of a million note receivable related to the sale of a former shipyard operation  was used to fund net capital expenditures of million and payments on debt obligations of million 
we anticipate that capital expenditures will be below depreciation and that we will fund capital expenditures for with cash generated from operations 
the majority of capital expenditures are expected to be used principally to expand drilling fluids service capacity in growing markets as and when needed and will be adjusted depending on market conditions  our operating cash flows and other available cash resources 
our long term capitalization was as follows as of december long term debt excluding current maturities credit facility senior subordinated notes barite facilities financing mexico mat financing other total long term debt stockholders equity total capitalization long term debt to long term capitalization on february   our bank credit facility was converted into an asset based lending facility the credit facility

the weighted average interest rates on the outstanding balances under the respective credit facilities for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our domestic assets and our domestic subsidiaries 
the credit facility contains a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant and a tangible net worth covenant 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the credit facility  as amended 
the notes do not contain any financial covenants  however  if we do not meet the financial covenants of the credit facility and are unable to obtain an amendment from the banks  we would be in default of the credit facility which would cause the notes to be in default and immediately due 
the notes  the credit facility and the certificate of designations relating to our preferred stock also contain covenants that significantly limit the payment of dividends on our common stock 
during the third quarter of  we closed a million project financing on our four barite mills barite facilities financing 
proceeds from this transaction were used to reduce advances under the credit facility 
the barite facilities financing is a million term loan facility that bears interest at one month libor plus at december  payable monthly  and matures august  principal payments are required monthly based on an amortization 
table of contents period of years  with a balloon payment at the maturity date 
the barite facilities financing is collateralized by our four barite facilities and requires compliance with various financial and nonfinancial covenants 
the financial covenants require us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a minimum tangible net worth 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  at december   million was outstanding under this agreement 
during the third quarter of  we also closed financing arrangements on million in support of a new mat operation in mexico mexico mat financing 
the mexico mat financing was used to acquire composite mats for our new mexican operation rather than using amounts available under the credit facility 
the mexico mat financing consists of two term loan facilities totaling million  bears interest at payable monthly and matures august  principal payments are required monthly based on an amortization period of years  with a balloon payment at the maturity date

engineering and related services are provided to customers at agreed upon hourly or daily rates  and revenues are recognized when the services are performed 

table of contents for the e p waste disposal segment  revenues are recognized when we take title to the waste  which is upon receipt of the waste at our facility 
all costs related to the transporting and disposing of the waste received are accrued when that revenue is recognized 
for the mat and integrated services segment  revenues for sales of wooden or composite mats are recognized when title passes to the customer  which is upon shipment or delivery  depending upon the terms of the underlying sales contract 
revenues in the mat and integrated services segment are generated from both fixed price and unit priced contracts  which are short term in duration 
the activities under these contracts include site preparation  pit design  construction and drilling waste management  and installation and use of our composite or wooden mat systems during an initial period 
this initial period includes revenues and costs for site preparation  installation and use of mat systems 
revenues from these contracts are recorded using the percentage of completion method based on project milestones as specified in the contracts 
at the end of the initial period  the customer  at its option  may extend the use of the mat systems 
revenues related to the extension period are quoted either on a day rate basis or at a fixed price and are recognized ratably over the agreed extension period 
revenues for services provided to customers at agreed upon hourly or daily rates are recognized when the services are performed 
the services typically provided to our customers at agreed upon hourly or daily rates include site assessment and regulatory compliance 
all reimbursements by customers of shipping and handling costs are included in revenues 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of revenues in the income statement 
allowance for doubtful accounts reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable and notes receivable are determined on a specific identification basis when we believe that the required payment of specific amounts owed to us is not probable 
for notes receivable  our judgments with respect to collectibility includes evaluating any underlying collateral 
in  we reassessed potential losses for all customers in bankruptcy proceedings 
the majority of our revenues are from mid sized and international oil companies and government owned or government controlled oil companies  and we have receivables in several foreign jurisdictions 
changes in oil and gas drilling activity or changes in economic conditions in foreign jurisdictions could cause our customers to be unable to repay these receivables  resulting in additional allowances 
since amounts due from individual customers can be significant  future adjustments to the allowance can be material 
inventory reserves for inventory obsolescence are determined based on fair value of the inventory using factors such as our historical usage of inventory on hand  future expectations related to our customers needs  market conditions and the development of new products 
we have recently developed several new products  including our deepdrill family of products and our dura base composite plastic mat system 
our inability to obtain market acceptance of these products  changes in oil and gas drilling activity and the development of new technologies associated with the drilling industry could require additional allowances to reduce the value of inventory to the lower of its cost or net realizable value 
impairments we perform goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests on at least an annual basis in accordance with the guidance in financial accounting standard fas  goodwill and other 
table of contents intangible assets 
we perform long lived asset impairment tests in accordance with fas  accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in accordance with fas  impairments are calculated based on a fair value concept 
in accordance with fas  impairments are calculated based on a future cash flow concept 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important  which could trigger an impairment review  include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant changes in the market value of assets  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and in our market capitalization relative to our net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based on one or more of the above indicators  any impairment is calculated in accordance with fas and fas and recorded as an impairment loss 
income taxes we have net deferred tax assets of million at december  we provide for deferred taxes in accordance with fas  accounting for income taxes 
under fas  a valuation allowance must be established to offset a deferred tax asset if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at december   we had recorded a valuation allowance for all state nols and for nols generated during start up operations of our mexican joint venture 
we have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for our valuation allowance 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period this determination was made 
new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fas revised  share based payment  fas r which is a revision of fas  accounting for stock based compensation 
fas r supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fas  statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in fas r is similar to the approach described in fas however  fas r requires that all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
fas r must be adopted no later than july  fas r permits adoption of its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirement of fas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of fas for all awards granted prior to the effective date of fas r that remain unvested on the effective date  and a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method previously described  but also permits restatement of prior periods based on the amounts previously reported in pro forma disclosures under fas we currently plan to adopt fas r using the modified prospective method 

table of contents as permitted by fas  we currently account for stock based compensation using accounting principles board apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of fas r will likely have a material impact on our results of operations 
however  the ultimate impact of adoption of fas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted fas r in prior periods  the impact would have approximated the impact of fas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note a to our consolidated financial statements under the heading stock based compensation 
in november  the fasb issued fas  inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage 
it requires that these items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet a criterion of so abnormal 
it also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
fas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  it is currently not known what impact the adoption of fas will have on newpark s financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and changes in foreign currency rates 
we do not believe that we have a material exposure to market risk 
historically  we have not entered into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk or for speculative purposes 
however  in november  we did enter into an interest rate swap arrangement 
a discussion of our primary market risk exposure in financial instruments is presented below 
long term debt our policy has historically been to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
at december   we had total debt outstanding of million  of which million  or  relates to our senior subordinated notes the notes  which bear interest at a fixed rate of 
the remaining million of debt outstanding at december  bears interest at a floating rate 
at december   the weighted average interest rate under our floating rate debt was approximately 
assuming a basis point increase in market interest rates during  our annual interest expense would increase approximately  net of taxes  resulting in a per diluted share reduction in annual earnings 
the notes mature on december  there are no scheduled principal payments under the notes prior to the maturity date 
however  all or some of the notes may be redeemed at a premium after december  we have no current plans to repay the notes ahead of their scheduled maturity 
in november  we entered into an interest rate swap instrument  which effectively converted our senior subordinated notes to a floating rate for a two year period ending in december on july   we terminated the swap instrument and received a payment of  the total benefit recognized under the swap instrument as a reduction to interest expense  including the termination fee  was million for the year ended december  
table of contents foreign currency our principal foreign operations are conducted in canada and in areas surrounding the mediterranean sea 
we have foreign currency exchange risks associated with these operations  which are principally conducted in the functional currency of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
historically  we have not used off balance sheet financial hedging instruments to manage foreign currency risks when we enter into a transaction denominated in a currency other than our local currencies because the dollar amount of these transactions has not warranted our using hedging instruments 
during the years ended december   and  we reported foreign currency gains of   and  respectively 
these transactional gains and losses were primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations related to monetary asset balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency  including intercompany advances which are deemed to be short term in nature 
we estimate that a hypothetical movement of all applicable foreign currency exchange rates would affect annual earnings by approximately  due to the revaluing of these monetary assets and intercompany balances 
assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date  resulting in translation adjustments that are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section of our balance sheet 
included in comprehensive income are translation gains of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   net assets of foreign subsidiaries included in our consolidated balance sheet totaled million 
we estimate that a hypothetical movement of all applicable foreign currency exchange rates would affect other comprehensive income by approximately million 
fair value of financial instruments the fair value of cash and cash equivalents  net accounts receivable  accounts payable and variable rate debt approximated book value at december  the fair value of the notes totaled million at december  the fair value of the notes has been estimated based on quotes from the lead broker
