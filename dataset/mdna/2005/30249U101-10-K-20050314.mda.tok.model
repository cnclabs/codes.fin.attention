the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal years ended december   and  should be read in conjunction with our 
table of contents audited consolidated financial statements  and the notes to those statements  and our selected historical financial data included elsewhere in this document 
background fmc technologies  inc was incorporated in delaware on november   and was a wholly owned subsidiary of fmc corporation until its initial public offering on june   when the company sold of its common stock to the public 
on december   fmc corporation distributed its remaining ownership of fmc technologies common stock to fmc corporation s shareholders in the form of a dividend 
executive overview we design  manufacture and service sophisticated machinery and systems for customers in the energy  food processing and air transportation industries 
we have operations in countries and are strategically located to facilitate delivery of our products and services to our customers 
we operate in four business segments energy production systems  energy processing systems  foodtech and airport systems business segments section in part i 
item our business segments serve diverse industries with a wide customer base 
we focus on economic and industry specific drivers and key risk factors affecting each of our business segments as we formulate our strategic plans and make decisions related to allocating capital and human resources 
the following discussion provides examples of the kinds of economic and industry factors and key risks that we consider 
the results of our energy systems businesses are primarily driven by changes in exploration and production spending by oil and gas companies  which in part depend upon current and anticipated future crude oil and natural gas prices and production volumes 
fluctuations in raw material prices  such as the increase in steel prices in the past year  affect product costs in many of our energy systems business units 
however  in most of these business units  we have been able to pass on steel cost increases to our customers 
our energy production systems business is affected by trends in land and offshore oil and gas production  including shallow and deepwater output 
additionally  given the substantial capital investments required from our customers to complete an offshore project  our customers overall profitability influences our results 
our energy processing systems business results reflect spending by oilfield service companies and engineering construction companies for equipment and systems that facilitate the measurement and transportation of crude oil and natural gas 
the level of production activity worldwide influences spending decisions  and we use rig count as one indicator of demand 
our foodtech business results reflect the level of capital investment being made by our food processing customers 
the level of capital spending also is influenced by changing consumer preferences  public perception of food safety  conditions in the agricultural sector  such as weather  that affect commodity prices  and by our customers overall profitability 
additionally  foodtech volumes may fluctuate as a result of consolidation of customers in the commercial food processing industry 
the results of our airport systems business are highly dependent upon the profitability of our customers in the airline and air cargo markets 
their profitability is affected by fluctuations in passenger and freight traffic and the volatility of operating expenses  including the impact of costs related to labor  fuel and airline security 
in addition  results in our airport systems 
table of contents business are also influenced by the level of purchases of our halvorsen loaders by the us air force  which depend upon governmental funding approvals 
similar to energy production systems  rising steel prices have increased costs in airport systems  especially in our jetway business 
changes in significant raw material prices  such as steel  will continue to impact our airport systems results 
we also focus on key risk factors when determining our overall strategy and making decisions for allocating capital 
these factors include risks associated with the global economic outlook  product obsolescence  and the competitive environment 
we address these risks in our business strategies  which incorporate continuing development of leading edge technologies  cultivating strong customer relationships  and implementing strategic international expansion 
in  we continued to emphasize technological advancement in all of our segments 
in energy production systems  we continued the development of an all electric subsea production system  which will use simpler controls than conventional systems that rely on hydraulics 
foodtech launched a variety of new products during  including a waterjet portioning system for poultry and meat products 
in  airport systems began marketing the rampsnake automated baggage loader for use in narrow body aircraft 
this product is designed to reduce the manual effort to move baggage into the airplane 
we are committed to continuing our investments in technological innovations to expand our technology base  develop new products and increase profitability 
we have developed close working relationships with our customers in all of our business segments 
our energy production systems business results reflect our ability to build long term alliances with oil and gas companies that are actively engaged in offshore deepwater development  and provide solutions to their needs in a timely and cost effective manner 
we have formed similar collaborative relationships with oilfield service companies in energy processing systems  air cargo companies in airport systems and citrus processors in foodtech 
we believe that by working closely with our customers that we enhance our competitive advantage  strengthen our market positions and improve our results 
in all of our segments  we serve customers from around the world 
during  of our total sales were to non us locations 
we evaluate international markets and pursue opportunities that fit our business model 
for example  we have targeted opportunities in west africa and asia pacific because of the offshore drilling potential in those regions  and we have identified a market for jetway passenger boarding bridges in asia 
as we evaluate our operating results  we view our business segments by product line and consider performance indicators like segment revenues  operating profit and capital employed  in addition to the level of inbound orders and order backlog 
as we analyze our financial condition  items of importance include factors that impact our liquidity and capital resources  including working capital  net debt and access to capital 

table of contents consolidated results of operations compared with fmc technologies total revenue for fiscal year increased by million  or  to  million  primarily due to continued growth in our energy systems businesses 
in  our technological capabilities enabled us to continue to benefit from the growing demand for the supply of equipment used in the major oil and gas producing regions throughout the world 
to a lesser extent  the increase in revenue also reflected higher revenue in the airport systems business segment 
of the total increase in sales  million was attributable to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation 
cost of sales and services for the year ended december  was  million  an increase of million compared with cost of sales and services totaled of sales  up from in the increase in cost of sales and services resulted primarily from higher sales volumes during the impact of foreign currency translation and a provision for anticipated losses on our contract with sonatrach trc  the algerian oil and gas company sonatrach were responsible for and of the increase  respectively  in cost of sales and services 
these increases in cost were partially offset by the positive impact of cost saving measures and a more favorable product mix in selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december   increased million  or  compared to the year ended december  unfavorable changes in foreign currency translation represented million of the increase 
the remaining increase reflected higher employee related costs associated with business expansion  especially in our energy production systems business segment 
in  selling  general and administrative expenses were of sales  down from of sales in pre tax income in increased to million million after tax  from income of million million after tax in the increase in income was primarily attributable to a million gain million after tax on the conversion of our investment in modec international llc  and the positive impact of higher sales volumes 
in addition  net income reflected the benefit of tax adjustments of million resulting from a favorable judgment in a tax dispute and the resolution of foreign tax audits in the fourth quarter of these increases were partially offset by the negative impact of two charges recorded against income in we recorded a loss provision in energy production systems of million million after tax on the sonatrach project  mainly due to the effect of severe weather conditions 
in energy processing systems  a million impairment charge million after tax was required to write off goodwill associated with the blending and transfer product line 
lower operating profit from foodtech also contributed to the unfavorable comparison 
the gain on conversion of our investment in modec international llc was associated with our decision to exchange our interest in modec international llc for cash and shares of common stock of modec  inc modec international llc was a joint venture investment between fmc technologies and a subsidiary of modec  inc the joint venture agreement gave us the right to convert our ownership beginning in modec international llc was part of the energy production systems business segment 
the gain on conversion of our interest in the joint venture is not included in our measure of segment operating profit 

table of contents outlook for we are anticipating continued growth in our earnings per share in we expect growth to be driven by our energy systems businesses  and anticipate that foodtech and airport systems will perform at a level that is equal to or slightly higher than their full year results 
we currently estimate that our full year diluted earnings per share will be within the range of to 
this estimate does not include the impact  if any  of changes in foreign dividend repatriation under the provisions of the american jobs creation act of compared with our total revenue for fiscal year increased by million  or  to billion 
higher sales attributable to energy production systems represented the majority of the revenue increase 
two thirds of this business segment s growth in was from the increase in sales of subsea systems  reflecting the continued trend toward offshore development of deepwater oil and gas fields 
energy processing systems and foodtech also contributed to the increase compared with a decrease in airport systems sales partially offset these increases in revenue 
the growth in total revenue included the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency translation which accounted for million or of the total increase 
for the year ended december   cost of sales and services was  million  an increase of compared with on a consolidated basis  cost of sales and services as a percentage of total revenue remained consistent with results at 
during we incurred an incremental million in restructuring and asset impairment charges compared to  which were offset by cost reductions  resulting in comparable margins 
for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expense increased million  or  compared to the year ended december  unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased these expenses by approximately million 
the remaining increase reflects higher staffing  travel and compensation costs related to increased business activity  especially within the energy production systems business segment 
in  selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales was consistent with results 
pre tax income in increased to million million after tax  from pre tax income of million million after tax before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the million increase in pre tax income was primarily attributable to higher segment operating profit and  to a lesser extent  lower net interest expense  partially offset by an increase in other expense  net 
changes in accounting principles employee stock based compensation expense on january   we began accounting for employee stock option compensation expense using the fair value method in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

in prior years  stock options represented approximately of the total 
the effect of this change was a reduction in expense related to stock options offset by an increase in expense related to other types of stock based compensation 
additionally  in  our stock based compensation expense relating to stock options is lower than previous levels due to the vesting in of larger than normal stock option grants that were issued in concurrent with our initial public offering and the absence of executive officer stock option grants in 
table of contents the following is a summary of the components of stock based compensation expense included in our results year ended december  in millions  before the effect of income taxes stock option compensation expense all other stock based compensation expense total stock based compensation expense cumulative effect of an accounting change in goodwill and other intangible assets on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the standards collectively provide for the recognition  amortization and continuing valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
we completed the goodwill impairment testing that is required upon adoption of sfas no 
during the first quarter of the adoption of sfas no 
on january   resulted in a loss from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million  net of an income tax benefit of million  affecting the foodtech business segment million before taxes  million after tax and the energy processing systems business segment million before taxes  million after tax 
this loss was not the result of a change in the outlook of the businesses but was due to a change in the method of measuring goodwill impairment as required by the adoption of sfas no 
the impact of adopting the provisions of sfas no 
relating to goodwill amortization resulted in our discontinuing the amortization of goodwill beginning january operating results of business segments segment operating profit is defined as total segment revenue less segment operating expenses

table of contents energy production systems compared with energy production systems revenue was higher in than in the same period in  with growth in subsea systems  floating production systems and  to a lesser extent  the surface business 
revenue from sales of subsea systems of billion in increased million  or  from million in  of which million related to higher volumes and million to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation 
subsea volumes increased primarily as a result of new and ongoing projects located offshore brazil  the north sea  asia pacific and offshore west africa  partially offset by a reduction in projects in the gulf of mexico 
floating production systems revenues grew by million over the same period in the prior year 
this was primarily attributable to higher revenue associated with the sonatrach project  which increased million to a total of million in energy production systems operating profit increased compared with  with higher volumes and favorable margins in our subsea and surface businesses more than offsetting the impact of higher selling  general and administrative expense and period costs related to the sonatrach project 
operating profit from subsea systems grew from as a result of higher sales volumes and improved margins 
the increase in subsea systems was offset by a decline in operating profit at our floating production systems business compared to  which was primarily the result of million in pre tax provisions recorded for anticipated losses on the sonatrach project 
to a lesser extent  energy production systems operating profit increased as a result of higher sales volumes and margins in the surface business 
selling  general and administrative expense were higher in compared to the prior year  attributable to increased bid and proposal costs and variable selling expenses  such as commissions 
the sonatrach contract with the floating production systems division involves the supply of a petroleum loading system 
in early  the size of this contract was reduced from million to million  and uncertainty was removed from the contract s scope and schedule  however  from a profit perspective  we expected to break even 
in july  a second amendment to the contract increased the project size to million 
also  during the third quarter  we recognized a million pre tax provision for anticipated losses due to an increase in the estimate of our total project costs 
in november  severe storms in algeria delayed completion of the pipeline installation phase of the project 
as a result of these storms  we recorded an additional provision for anticipated losses amounting to million pre tax 
at december   the project was approximately complete 
compared with energy production systems revenue was higher in than the same period in  reflecting increases in subsea systems  the surface business and floating production systems 
revenue from sales of subsea systems of million in grew million  or  from million in  of which million related to higher volumes and million to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation 
the higher sales volumes in subsea systems were attributable primarily to projects located in the north sea  gulf of mexico and  to a lesser extent  offshore brazil 
in the surface business  revenues increased by million in over the same period in the prior year reflecting increased deliveries of land based systems in north america and offshore systems outside of the us revenues in also reflected an increase for floating production systems of million  primarily resulting from the sonatrach project  and a partial year benefit of million from the acquisition of cds engineering cds 

table of contents energy production systems operating profit growth compared with was a result of the subsea systems and surface businesses  as operating profit increased by million and million  respectively  as a result of higher sales volumes 
lower profit recorded by our floating production systems business partially offset the improvements in subsea and surface 
depreciation and amortization expense increased in  attributable to capital expenditures made in prior periods to support increased subsea volumes and to increased amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisition of cds 
outlook for for  we are expecting another year of growth in operating profit in our energy production systems business 
this expectation is based on our strong backlog of orders in subsea systems and forecasts of favorable market conditions  including the benefit from continued high oil and gas prices and increased rig activity worldwide 
in floating production systems  we expect sonatrach sales volumes to decline and profitability to improve as the project concludes in the third quarter of in our separation systems business  we continued integration activities in  and the business is expected to improve its sales and profitability in energy processing systems compared with energy processing systems revenue was higher in compared with  with sales of measurement and material handling equipment contributing million and million  respectively  to the increase 
strong demand for measurement equipment for pipeline and tank truck applications was driven by the level of oil and gas prices  while higher sales of material handling equipment resulted primarily from increased demand for the bulk conveying systems needed for coal fired power generation 
in addition  the favorable impact of foreign currency translation accounted for million of the increase in segment revenue 
fluid control reported slightly higher revenue in  as a million increase in sales reflecting weco chiksan product demand was almost completely offset by a decrease in sales of production manifold systems  the latter resulting from competitive pressure 
the growth in sales of the weco chiksan product line  which we sell mainly to service companies  continued to reflect the impact of strong land based drilling activity in the us energy processing systems operating profit was lower in compared with  mainly as a result of a fourth quarter goodwill impairment charge amounting to million associated with the blending and transfer product line 
also contributing to lower segment operating profit was a million decrease in loading systems margins  reflecting competitive pressure and higher operating costs 
the positive impact of higher volumes on profitability in material handling and measurement equipment  which amounted to million and million  respectively  partially offset the decrease in segment operating profit 
the goodwill impairment charge of million million after tax eliminated all remaining goodwill associated with the blending and transfer business 
we experienced a lack of inbound orders in the blending and transfer product line for a sustained period of time 
this was due  in part  to the volatility of oil and gas prices  which reduced the willingness of oil 
table of contents companies to invest capital to upgrade existing blending facilities or to invest in new blending capacity 
compared with compared to  revenue for energy processing systems increased as a result of higher sales volumes and favorable foreign currency translation  which accounted for million and million  respectively  of the increase 
the positive impact of higher volumes of weco chiksan equipment in our fluid control division reflected increased service company demand 
also  measurement equipment and loading systems volumes were both higher in  with measurement sales reflecting stronger demand for metering systems and loading systems benefiting from increased activity in the liquefied natural gas lng market 
energy processing systems higher operating profit reflected the increased sales volumes in  with the fluid control and measurement divisions reporting increased operating profit of million and million  respectively 
these increases in operating profit were partly offset by a million reduction in operating profit from material handling systems  primarily attributable to difficult market conditions 
the improvement in profitability for fluid control equipment  which resulted from the increased demand from service companies for the weco chiksan products  was partly offset by an increase in contract reserves associated with a production manifold system project 
for loading systems  the favorable impact of higher sales volumes on operating profit was largely offset by the effect of pricing pressure in the competitive lng loading arm market 
outlook for in  we expect energy processing systems to deliver overall growth in operating profit over we are projecting increased profitability in our production manifold systems business along with improved performance from loading systems and measurement systems 
in our fluid control business  we expect demand for weco chiksan equipment from service companies to be consistent with levels 
in the first quarter of  we will begin a million project to restructure our material handling systems product line 
the purpose of this restructuring program is to reduce costs through the outsourcing of work to suppliers and the shifting of work to other energy processing systems facilities to better leverage capacity 
while this activity will negatively impact the first quarter of  we believe the full year impact will not be significant 

table of contents foodtech compared with foodtech revenue for was essentially flat compared with higher volumes of freezing  portioning and cooking equipment in were responsible for an increase of million in revenue  reflecting stronger demand in the north american and asian markets 
in addition  year over year changes in foreign currency translation resulted in a million increase in revenue 
these increases were largely offset by the million negative impact on revenue resulting from lower volumes of fruit and vegetable processing equipment  primarily reflecting a decline in the global market for tomato processing equipment 
to a lesser extent  the increase in foodtech revenue was also offset by lower volumes of canning and citrus systems and the impact on revenue of the divestiture of our us agricultural harvester product line in the fourth quarter of foodtech s operating profit was lower in compared with  with a decrease of million attributable to lower citrus volumes  and an additional million decrease resulting from lower volumes of other fruit and vegetable processing equipment 
the decline in profitability was partially offset by a million increase in the freezing  portioning and cooking equipment businesses  primarily attributable to the positive impact of reduced expenses 
compared with the increase in foodtech s revenue in primarily reflected a million favorable effect of foreign currency translation compared with  largely attributable to the weakening of the us dollar against the euro and the swedish krona 
sales of cooking equipment in north america contributed million to the increase in revenue 
partially offsetting these favorable effects was a significant decrease in sales of freezing equipment  reflecting competitive pressure in the north american market and a weaker european economy in compared with  foodtech s operating profit increased  reflecting the positive impact of foreign currency translation of million  net  as the increase in revenue resulting from foreign currency translation was largely offset by the negative impact on profitability resulting from translation of the corresponding expenses 
in addition  a million favorable adjustment relating to foreign sales taxes in contributed to the increase in operating profit 
these increases in operating profit were largely offset by the unfavorable impact resulting from lower sales volumes of freezing equipment  and the impact of lower citrus margins  reflecting competitive pressures 
because our us agricultural harvester product line no longer fit the strategic initiatives of our foodtech business  we divested the product line in  resulting in a pre tax loss of million 
outlook for our foodtech business performance is expected to be essentially level with results 
we anticipate an increase in profitability from food processing equipment  primarily related to sterilizer and canning equipment  and from the freezer and food handling product lines 
the increase in profitability is expected to be offset by lower citrus results  attributable in large part to the impact of the hurricane damage on the florida citrus crop 

table of contents airport systems compared with airport systems revenue increased in compared with higher revenues from sales of jetway passenger boarding bridges and ground support equipment each represented million of the increase 
stronger sales of jetway passenger boarding bridges reflected increased deliveries to domestic airlines and  to a lesser extent  airport authorities 
ground support equipment revenue increased as a result of higher sales to ground handlers and cargo handling companies  primarily in north america  and the positive impact of foreign currency translation of million 
airport services sales grew by million over the same period in the prior year due to new projects in the dallas and los angeles airports 
these increases were partially offset by the million decrease in halvorsen loader revenue  as deliveries decreased from units in to units in sales of halvorsen loaders fluctuate based on the status of government approval of funding and the requirements of the us air force 
airport systems operating profit in increased compared with  primarily attributable to the volume increases in jetway and ground support equipment  which contributed to million in incremental operating profit for the year 
reduced volume in halvorsen loaders caused a million decrease in operating profit for compared with airport systems revenue decreased in compared with as weak demand from commercial airlines and airport municipalities continued to negatively affect airport systems in sales of jetway passenger boarding bridges and halvorsen loaders were lower compared with by million and million  respectively  the latter reflecting a lower level of deliveries to the us air force 
halvorsen loader deliveries decreased from units in to units in increased sales of automated guided vehicle systems of million and the positive impact of foreign currency translation of million partially offset the decrease in revenue from the same period in airport systems operating profit in decreased compared with  primarily due to lower volumes of halvorsen loaders  which contributed to a million decline in operating profit  partially offset by an improvement in profitability of million from our ground support equipment business 
the negative impact of the jetway business lower volumes in was partially offset by higher margins  reflecting the benefit of cost cutting initiatives implemented in prior periods  resulting in a net decline in operating profit of million from the same period in outlook for we are projecting operating profit at airport systems to be up slightly in world airline passenger traffic is anticipated to grow at approximately in however  the traditional major airlines continue to suffer the challenges of higher fuel costs  low airfares and high labor costs  which are delaying the industry s recovery 
while we have received an order for halvorsen loaders for delivery  the total halvorsen loader volume of units in is lower than volume 
we expect our commercial businesses  principally the ground support equipment business  to offset the impact of the forecasted decline in halvorsen loader shipments 

table of contents inbound orders and order backlog inbound orders represent the estimated sales value of confirmed customer orders received during the reporting period 
inbound orders year ended december  in millions energy production systems energy processing systems intercompany eliminations subtotal energy systems foodtech airport systems intercompany eliminations total inbound orders order backlog is calculated as the estimated sales value of unfilled  confirmed customer orders at the reporting date 
order backlog december  in millions energy production systems energy processing systems intercompany eliminations subtotal energy systems foodtech airport systems intercompany eliminations total order backlog the portion of total order backlog at december   that we project will be recorded as revenue after fiscal year amounts to approximately million 
higher order backlog for energy production systems at december   was primarily attributable to orders received for subsea systems in full year of billion  including significant projects for norsk hydro  statoil  bp and total 
order backlog for surface systems was higher compared with the prior year as a result of favorable market conditions  including higher gas and oil prices 
order backlog for floating production systems declined as the sonatrach project neared its completion 

table of contents energy processing systems order backlog at december  decreased compared to december  the unfavorable comparison related primarily to material handling systems  which had million in order backlog at year end relating to a coal fired power generation bulk conveying system 
to a lesser extent  lower order backlog was also attributable to loading systems and measurement equipment  the latter the result of shipments of metering systems outpacing inbound orders  reducing year end order backlog 
foodtech s order backlog at december   was higher compared with december   primarily attributable to higher order backlog for canning and freezing equipment 
the increase was partially offset by order backlog for food handling equipment  which was lower at december   compared with the prior year 
airport systems order backlog at december   declined compared with the prior year as a result of a reduction in the order backlog for halvorsen loaders 
in addition  several large automated material handling projects  which were included in order backlog at year end  were nearing completion at december  these decreases were partially offset by higher backlog in airport services 
corporate items gain on conversion of investment in modec international llc modec international llc was a joint venture between fmc technologies and a subsidiary of modec  inc we had a interest in the joint venture  which was a supplier of floating production offloading systems and other offshore installations such as tension leg platforms 
in  we elected to convert our interest in modec international llc as provided for in the joint venture agreement 
the terms of that agreement gave us the right to exchange our joint venture interest for proceeds based on the relative contribution of the operating results of the joint venture to the income of modec  inc for the preceding two fiscal years 
at modec  inc s option  the proceeds could consist of cash or shares of common stock of modec  inc  or a combination thereof 
in november  we received proceeds from modec  inc of million in exchange for our interest in modec international llc and recorded a gain of million million after tax 
the proceeds consisted of billion yen  or million  and million common shares of modec  inc  representing of modec  inc  valued at million 
at december   the fair value of this investment was million 
there is a risk that we will be unable to fully realize our investment in modec  inc  due to its potential even likely illiquidity 
corporate expense corporate expense in was higher when compared with the prior year  due primarily to higher sarbanes oxley compliance costs

in  we began recording expense for stock options in accordance with sfas no 
 and our prior period results have been restated to reflect this change 
the decrease in other expense  net  from the prior year is attributable to million in lower stock based compensation expense  million in reduced costs related to our outsourcing of employee benefits administration and million in favorable changes in foreign currency hedging results 
these declines were partially offset by a million increase in pension expense caused by lower discount rate and asset return assumptions 
other expense  net  was higher in than largely due to higher pension expense of million and the absence of a gain of million on the sale of the corporate aircraft 
we anticipate that other expense  net  will increase in  largely due to higher expenses related to stock based compensation and lifo inventory 
net interest expense net interest expense is comprised of interest expense related to external debt financing less interest income earned on cash equivalents and marketable securities 
when compared with the prior year  net interest expense decreased in  primarily attributable to lower average debt levels 
in  net interest expense was lower compared with  reflecting lower average debt levels as well as lower interest rates during in  lower interest rates were partly attributable to our use of commercial paper as a short term funding source beginning in the first quarter of as well as the maturity in of interest rate swaps which held higher fixed interest rates 
we obtained interest rate swaps in the second quarter of that fix the effective annual interest rate on million of our commercial paper at an average all in rate of 
these interest rate swaps mature in june we expect net interest expense for full year to be lower than due to lower average debt levels 
income tax expense income tax expense for the year ended december   resulted in an effective tax rate of

income tax expense in and was restated in connection with the change in accounting for stock based compensation  which we chose to apply retroactively 
this restatement resulted in a reduction of income tax expense of million and million in and  respectively 
the differences between the effective tax rates for these years and the statutory us federal income tax rate relate primarily to differing foreign tax rates  taxes on intercompany dividends and deemed dividends for tax purposes  the settlement of the tax dispute and audits  and non deductible expenses 
for full year  we currently anticipate our effective income tax rate to average just over

we reduced our net debt during with cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options of million 
we also received cash of million in connection with the conversion of our interest in modec international llc 
we utilized cash in to fund million in capital expenditures  repay million of outstanding debt and contribute million to our pension plans 
cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended december   were as follows year ended december  in millions cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations cash required by discontinued operations cash required by investing activities cash required by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating cash flows cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations for the year ended december  was lower compared with the same period in as a result of higher working capital requirements during for our long term contracts 
cash payments for inventory grew by million over the prior year  primarily in the energy production systems segment 
cash flows from accounts receivable and advance payments were lower than the prior year by million and million  respectively  as a result of higher sales volumes and the timing of customer payments 
these uses of cash were partially offset by higher balances of accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities  which provided million and million  respectively  of incremental operating cash flow in the accounts payable and other liabilities balances grew as a result of higher spending driven by increasing sales volumes 
during  we contributed million to our pension plans compared to million in the prior year 
the entire contribution to our domestic qualified pension plan of million was discretionary 
compared with the same period in  the increase in cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations for the year ended december  reflected an increase of million in net income 
additionally  changes in working capital requirements resulted in net cash 
table of contents inflows of million 
the changes in working capital requirements included an increase in cash from advance payments primarily from our energy production systems customers partially offset by the impact of higher accounts receivable balances in cash required by discontinued operations cash required by discontinued operations in was relatively flat compared with and these cash outflows represent payments for claims  claims administration and insurance coverage for product liabilities associated with equipment which had been manufactured by our discontinued businesses 
investing cash flows cash required by investing activities decreased by million in compared to higher cash outflows in were principally due to the million outflow for the cds acquisition and the retirement of million of sale leaseback obligations 
the decrease in cash required by investing activities is also attributable to the million cash inflow from the conversion of our interest in modec international llc in  as well as a million reduction in capital expenditures 
compared to  the increase in cash required by investing activities in reflected cash paid for a majority ownership interest in cds 
also in  we retired sale leaseback obligations and replaced them with lower cost balance sheet debt 
in  investing cash flows reflected the retirement of sale leaseback obligations relating to our corporate aircraft  offset by proceeds from its subsequent sale 
financing cash flows cash required by financing activities increased slightly in we made payments on our outstanding debt obligations of million compared to net payments of million during we received million in proceeds from the issuance of million shares of common stock upon the exercise of vested employee stock options in  which was a million increase from the prior year amount 
as of december   million vested stock options remained outstanding  all of which had exercise prices that were less than the closing price of our stock on december  during  our financing cash flows reflected the repayment of million of short and long term debt  which was replaced with borrowings of million under our newly established commercial paper program 
this shift allowed us to substantially lower the interest cost on our debt 
in the second quarter of  we entered into interest rate swaps that fixed the effective annual interest rate on million of our commercial paper at an average all in rate of for five years

the five year revolving credit facility maturing april carries an effective annual interest rate of basis points above the one month libor 
we had no borrowings outstanding under our five year million revolving credit facilities at december  and million outstanding at december  at december   we had an interest rate swap agreement that matured in june related to million of the long term borrowings that fixed the interest rate thereon at 
during the second quarter of  we repaid the revolving credit facility borrowings  partly with proceeds from our commercial paper program  and the interest rate swap agreement matured 
our uncommitted credit includes domestic money market facilities and international lines of credit 
borrowings under these uncommitted facilities totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
prior to its cancellation in october  we also had an uncommitted credit agreement with modec international llc  a owned joint venture  whereby modec international llc loaned its excess cash to us 
under the terms of the credit agreement  the interest rate was based on the monthly weighted average interest rate we pay on our domestic credit facilities and

our annual payments associated with this obligation total million 
other domestic and international borrowings totaled million at both december  and outlook for we are authorized to repurchase up to two million shares of common stock 
we have announced plans to begin the repurchase of shares of our outstanding common stock during the timing and amount of repurchases will depend on market conditions 
we plan to meet our cash requirements in with cash generated from operations  our available credit facilities and commercial paper 
in  we expect to pay previously accrued income taxes of approximately million  primarily due to the completion of significant subsea projects in norway 
we included this obligation on our consolidated balance sheet in current income taxes payable at december  and in current deferred income taxes at december  for  we estimate capital expenditures will be in the range of million  compared with capital spending of approximately million 
the anticipated increase in the level of capital spending is partly attributable to expenditures planned in malaysia and angola by energy production systems to support our subsea business 
we expect to fund approximately million to our pension plans  a substantial portion of which will be made at management s discretion 
we will make a discretionary contribution of million to our domestic qualified pension plan 
using our current assumptions  we will not have a minimum funding requirement on the domestic qualified pension plan until we continue to evaluate acquisitions  divestitures and joint ventures in the ordinary course of business

we were in compliance with all covenants at december   however  any violation of debt covenants  event of default  or change in our credit rating could have a material impact on our ability to maintain our committed financing arrangements 
b in the normal course of business  we enter into agreements with our suppliers to purchase raw materials or services 
these agreements include a requirement that our supplier provide products or services to our specifications and require us to make a firm purchase commitment to our supplier 
as substantially all of these commitments are associated with purchases made to fulfill our customers orders  the costs associated with these agreements will ultimately be reflected in cost of sales and services on our consolidated statements of income

in addition  we also have a commitment to acquire the remaining ownership interest in cds in at a purchase price of slightly less than times the average of of cds and earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
at the current time  we are unable to estimate the amount of this commitment

in order to obtain these financial instruments  we pay fees to various financial institutions in amounts competitively determined in the marketplace 
our ability to generate revenue from certain contracts is dependent upon our ability to obtain these off balance sheet financial instruments 
these off balance sheet financial instruments may be renewed  revised or released based on changes in the underlying commitment 
historically  our commercial commitments have not been drawn upon to a material extent  consequently  management believes it is not likely that there will be claims against these commitments that will have a negative impact on our key financial ratios or our ability to obtain financing 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and certain equity prices 
in order to manage and mitigate our exposure to these risks  we may use derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we do not use derivative financial instruments where the objective is to generate profits solely from trading activities 
at december  and  our derivative holdings consisted of foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swap agreements 
these forward looking disclosures only address potential impacts from market risks as they affect our financial instruments 
they do not include other potential effects which could impact our business as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  commodity prices or equity prices 
foreign currency exchange rate risk when we sell or purchase products or services  transactions are frequently denominated in currencies other than the particular operation s functional currency 
generally  we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency transactions if a natural hedge exists  whereby purchases and sales in the same foreign currency and with similar maturity dates offset one another 
when natural hedges are not available  we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with third parties 
our hedging policy is designed to reduce the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements  and we expect any gain or loss in the hedging portfolio to be offset by a corresponding gain or loss in the underlying exposure being hedged 

table of contents we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in the foreign currency exchange rates 
we also hedge firmly committed  anticipated transactions in the normal course of business 
the majority of these instruments mature during we use a sensitivity analysis to measure the impact on derivative instrument fair values of an immediate adverse movement in the foreign currency exchange rates 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar and all other variables are held constant 
we expect that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments will offset the changes in fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities on the balance sheet 
to the extent that our derivative instruments are hedging anticipated transactions  a decrease in the value of the us dollar would result in a decrease of million in the net fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december  changes in the derivative fair value will not have an impact on our results of operations unless these contracts are deemed to be ineffective 
we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure related to our investment in modec  inc  which was acquired during and is denominated in japanese yen 
as an available for sale investment  we account for changes in value through other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
an immediate adverse movement in the value of the us dollar against the japanese yen would result in a decrease in fair value of the investment of million 
interest rate risk our debt instruments subject us to market risk associated with movements in interest rates 
we did not have significant unhedged variable rate debt at december  in june  we entered into three floating to fixed interest rate swaps related to million of our commercial paper borrowings 
the effect of these interest rate swaps is to fix the effective annual interest rate on these borrowings at an average rate of until the swaps mature in june we use a sensitivity analysis to measure the impact on fair values for interest rate swaps of an immediate adverse movement in the interest rates 
this analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a change in interest rates 
a decrease in the applicable interest rates  or approximately  would result in a decrease of million in the net fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december  equity price risk we have equity price risk exposure related to our investment in the common stock of modec  inc  which was acquired during as an available for sale investment  we account for changes in the equity price through other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
a decline in the value of the equity price would result in a decrease in fair value of investments of million at december  
table of contents critical accounting estimates we prepare the consolidated financial statements of fmc technologies in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
on an ongoing basis  our management re evaluates these estimates  judgments and assumptions for reasonableness because of the critical impact that these factors have on the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed this disclosure 
revenue recognition using the percentage of completion method of accounting we record revenue on construction type manufacturing and assembly projects using the percentage of completion method  where revenue is recorded as work progresses on each contract 
there are several acceptable methods of measuring progress toward completion 
most frequently  we use the ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs to measure this progress  however  there are also types of contracts where we consistently apply the ratio of units delivered to date or units of work performed as a percentage of total units because we have determined that these methods provide a more accurate measure of progress toward completion 
total estimated contract cost is a critical accounting estimate because it can materially affect net income and it requires us to make judgments about matters that are uncertain 
revenue recorded using the percentage of completion method amounted to  million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
a significant portion of our total revenue recorded under the percentage of completion method relates to the energy production systems business segment  primarily for subsea petroleum exploration equipment projects that involve the design  engineering  manufacturing and assembly of complex  customer specific systems 
the systems are not built from standard bills of material and typically require extended periods of time to construct 
we execute contracts with our customers that clearly describe the equipment  systems and or services that we will provide and the amount of consideration we will receive 
after analyzing the drawings and specifications of the contract requirements  our project engineers estimate total contract costs based on their experience with similar projects and then adjust these estimates for specific risks associated with each project  such as technical risks associated with a new design 
costs associated with specific risks are estimated by assessing the probability that conditions will arise that will affect our total cost to complete the project 
after work on a project begins  assumptions that form the basis for our calculation of total project cost are examined on a monthly basis and our estimates are updated to reflect new information as it becomes available 
it is reasonably possible that we could have used different estimates of total contract costs in our calculation of revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method 
if we had used a 
table of contents different estimate of total contract costs for each contract in progress at december   a increase or decrease in the estimated margin earned on each contract would have increased or decreased total revenue and pre tax income for the year ended december   by million 
inventory valuation inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
in order to determine net realizable value  we evaluate each component of inventory on a regular basis to determine whether it is excess or obsolete 
we record the decline in the carrying value of estimated excess or obsolete inventory as a reduction of inventory and as an expense included in cost of sales in the period it is identified 
our estimate of excess and obsolete inventory is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period 
in addition  it requires management to make judgments about the future demand for inventory 
in order to quantify excess or obsolete inventory  we begin by preparing a candidate listing of the components of inventory that have not demonstrated usage within the most recent two year period 
this list is then reviewed with sales  production and materials management personnel to determine whether this list of potential excess or obsolete inventory items is accurate 
management considers as part of this evaluation whether there has been a change in the market for finished goods  whether there will be future demand for on hand inventory items and whether there are components of inventory that incorporate obsolete technology 
it is reasonably possible that we could have used different assumptions about future sales when estimating excess or obsolete inventory 
had we assumed that future sales would be higher or lower than those used in our forecast  the effect on our estimate of excess or obsolete inventory and pre tax income for the year ended december   would have been an increase or decrease of million  on a current cost basis 
accounting for income taxes in determining our current income tax provision we assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
when we maintain deferred tax assets we must assess the likelihood that these assets will be recovered through adjustments to future taxable income 
to the extent we believe recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we record an allowance reducing the asset to a value we believe will be recoverable based on our expectation of future taxable income 
we believe the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period as it requires management to make assumptions about our future income over the lives of the deferred tax assets  and the impact of increasing or decreasing the valuation allowance is potentially material to our results of operations 
forecasting future income requires us to use a significant amount of judgment 
in estimating future income  we use our internal operating budgets and long range planning projections 
we develop our budgets and long range projections based on recent results  trends  economic and industry forecasts influencing our segments performance  our backlog  planned timing of new 
table of contents product launches  and customer sales commitments 
significant changes in the expected realizability of the deferred tax asset would require that we provide an additional valuation allowance against the gross value of our total deferred tax assets  resulting in a reduction of net income 
as of december   we estimated that it is not likely that we will generate future taxable income in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we have cumulative net operating losses and  therefore  we have provided a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets 
as of december   we estimated that it is more likely than not that we will have future taxable income in the united states to utilize our domestic deferred tax assets 
therefore  we have not provided a valuation allowance against any domestic deferred tax assets 
with respect to domestic deferred tax assets  it is reasonably possible we could have used a different estimate of future taxable income in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
if our estimate of future taxable income was lower than the estimate used  we would still generate sufficient taxable income to utilize such deferred tax assets 
retirement benefits we provide most of our employees with certain retirement pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefits 
in order to measure the expense and obligations associated with these retirement benefits  management must make a variety of estimates  including discount rates used to value certain liabilities  expected return on plan assets set aside to fund these costs  rate of compensation increase  employee turnover rates  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
we update these estimates on an annual basis or more frequently upon the occurrence of significant events 
these accounting estimates bear the risk of change due to the uncertainty attached to the estimate as well as the fact that these estimates are difficult to measure 
different estimates used by management could result in our recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time 
we use third party specialists to assist management in evaluating our assumptions as well as appropriately measuring the costs and obligations associated with these retirement benefits 
the discount rate and expected return on plan assets are based primarily on investment yields available and the historical performance of our plan assets 
they are critical accounting estimates because they are subject to management s judgment and can materially affect net income 
pension expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the discount rate used affects the periodic recognition of the interest cost component of net periodic pension cost 
the discount rate is based on rates at which the pension benefit obligation could effectively be settled on a present value basis 
we develop the assumed weighted average discount rate utilizing investment yields available at our determination date based on aa rated corporate long term bonds 
significant changes in the discount rate  such as those caused by changes in the yield curve  the mix of bonds available in the market  the duration of selected bonds  and the timing of expected benefit payments may result in volatility in pension expense and minimum pension liabilities 
we reduced the discount rate for our domestic and certain of our international plans during the weighted average discount rate declined from to in  after decreasing in from in 
table of contents it is reasonably possible that we could have used a different estimate for the weighted average discount rate in calculating annual pension expense 
holding other assumptions constant  for every reduction in the discount rate  annual pension expense would increase by approximately million before taxes 
holding other assumptions constant  for every increase in the discount rate  annual pension expense would decrease by approximately million before taxes 
our actual returns on plan assets on trailing year and trailing year bases have exceeded the estimated long term rate of return of 
our actual returns on plan assets were and in and  respectively 
the weighted average rate was adjusted in from the previous estimate of due to the expectation that more modest returns will be obtained in the near future 
the expected return on plan assets is recognized as part of the net periodic pension cost 
the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is amortized over the expected remaining service life of employees  so there is a lag time between the market s performance and its impact on plan results 
it is reasonably possible that we could have used a different estimate for the weighted average rate of return on plan assets in calculating pension expense 
holding other assumptions constant  for every reduction in the expected rate of return on plan assets  annual pension expense would increase by approximately million before taxes

the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act was signed into law on december  the act introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare medicare part d as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a prescription drug benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
under fsp  issued in january  we elected to defer recognizing the effect of the act until the pending authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy was issued 
in may  the fasb issued fsp  which provides guidance on accounting for the effects of the act and also requires certain disclosures 
under fsp  plan sponsors are 
table of contents required to determine whether their retiree drug coverage is actuarially equivalent to the medicare part d coverage 
sponsors are also allowed the option of deferring recognition if it has not been concluded whether benefits under their plan are actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
regulations providing clarification about how to determine whether a sponsor s plan qualifies for actuarial equivalency are pending until the us department of health and human services completes its interpretative work on the act 
without clarifying regulations related to the act  we have been unable to determine the extent to which the benefits provided by our plan are actuarially equivalent to those under medicare part d  therefore  our reported net periodic benefit cost does not reflect any amount associated with the federal subsidy 
when we obtain clarification  we will evaluate whether the benefits provided under our plan are actuarially equivalent 
as part of this evaluation  we may consider amending our retiree health program to coordinate with the new medicare prescription drug program or to receive the direct subsidy from the government 
if benefits provided by our plan are found to be actuarially equivalent to medicare part d  and the effects of the subsidy on the plan are significant  we will perform a measurement of plan assets and obligations as of the date that actuarial equivalency is determined consistent with the requirements of fsp any effect on the accumulated benefit obligation due to the subsidy shall be reflected as an actuarial gain 
in addition  the net periodic benefit cost for subsequent periods would reflect the effects of those measurements
