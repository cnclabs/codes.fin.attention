item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with item selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this filing 
some of the statements in the following discussion are forward looking statements 
see forward looking statements 
general we are a leading provider of information technology solutions and systems engineering and integration services to government customers as measured by revenue 
we design  integrate  maintain and upgrade state of the art information systems for national defense  intelligence  emergency response and other high priority government missions 
we also provide many of our government customers with the systems analysis  integration and program management skills necessary to manage their mission systems development and operations 
we have a broad customer and contract base and a diverse contract mix 
we currently serve over  us federal government customers in more than government agencies  as well as state and foreign governments 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenue was derived from contracts with the dod and intelligence agencies  and approximately from civilian agencies of the us federal government 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenue was from contracts where we were the lead  or prime  contractor 
our diverse contract base has approximately active contracts and more than  active task orders 
for the year ended december   our largest contract or task order accounted for approximately of our revenues 
we have a diverse mix of contract types  with approximately   and of our revenues for the year ended december  derived from time and materials  cost plus and fixed price contracts  respectively 
we generally do not pursue fixed price software development contracts that may create financial risk 
additionally  we have contracts with an estimated remaining contract value of billion as of december   of which million is funded backlog 
our contracts have a weighted average term of approximately years 
from december  to december   our estimated remaining contract value increased at a compounded annual growth rate  including the effect of acquisitions 
description of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates including those related to uncollected accounts receivable  contingent liabilities  revenue recognition  goodwill and other intangible assets 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable at the time the estimates are made 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that our critical accounting policies which require more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are revenue recognition  costs of revenues  goodwill impairment  long lived assets and identifiable intangible asset impairment and business combinations 
revenue recognition during the year ended december   we estimate that approximately of our revenues were derived from services and approximately from product sales 
services are performed under contracts that may be categorized into three primary types time and materials  cost plus reimbursement and firm fixed price 
revenue for time and materials contracts is recognized as time is spent at hourly rates  which are negotiated with the customer plus the cost of any allowable material costs and out of pocket expenses 
time and materials contracts are typically more profitable than cost plus contracts because of our ability to negotiate rates and manage costs on those contracts 
revenue is recognized under cost plus contracts on the basis of direct and indirect costs incurred plus a negotiated profit calculated as a percentage of costs or as performance based award fee 
cost plus type contracts provide relatively less risk than other contract types because we are reimbursed for all direct costs and certain indirect costs  such as overhead and general and administrative expenses  and are paid a fee for work performed 
for certain cost plus type contracts  which are referred to as cost plus award fee type contracts  we recognize the expected fee to be awarded by the customer at the time such fee can be reasonably estimated  based on factors such as our prior award experience  communications with the customer regarding our performance  including any interim performance evaluations rendered by the customer or our average historical award fee rate for the company 
for the years ended december  and  revenue for award fees accrued under cost plus award fee type contracts was million and million  respectively 
under substantially all fixed price contracts  which are predominantly level of effort contracts  revenues are recognized using the cost to cost method for all services provided 
for non service related fixed price contracts  revenues are recognized as units are delivered the units of delivery method 
in addition  we evaluate our contracts for multiple deliverables which may require the segmentation of each deliverable into separate accounting units for proper revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues under our us federal government contracts when a contract is executed  the contract price is fixed and determinable  delivery of the services or products has occurred  the contract is funded and collectibility of the contract price is considered probable 
our contracts with agencies of the us federal government are subject to periodic funding by the respective contracting agency 
funding for a contract may be provided in full at inception of the contract or ratably throughout the term of the contract as the services are provided 
from time to time  we may proceed with work on unfunded portions of existing contracts based on customer direction pending finalization and signing of contractual funding documents 
we have an internal process for approving any such work 
all revenue recognition is deferred during periods in which funding is not received 
costs incurred during such periods are deferred if the receipt of funding is assessed as probable 
in evaluating the probability of funding being received  we consider our previous experiences with the customer  communications with the customer regarding funding status  and our knowledge of available funding for the contract or program 
if funding is not assessed as probable  costs are expensed as they are incurred 
historically  we have not recorded any significant write offs because funding was not ultimately received 
we recognize revenues under our cost based us federal government contracts based on allowable contract costs  as mandated by the us federal government s cost accounting standards 
the costs we incur under us federal government contracts are subject to regulation and audit by certain agencies of the us federal government 
historically  contract cost disallowances resulting from government audits have not historically been significant 
our incurred costs have been audited through contract revenue recognition inherently involves estimation 
examples of such estimates include the level of effort needed to accomplish the tasks under the contract  the cost of those efforts  and a continual assessment of our progress toward the completion of the contract 
from time to time  circumstances may arise which require us to revise our estimated total revenue or costs 
typically  these revisions relate to contractual changes 
to the extent that a revised estimate affects contract revenue or profit previously recognized  we record the cumulative effect of the revision in the period in which it becomes known 
in addition  the full amount of an anticipated loss on any type of contract is recognized in the period in which it becomes known 
we may be exposed to variations in profitability if we encounter variances from estimated fees earned under award fee contracts and estimated costs under fixed price contracts 
we generally do not pursue fixed price software development work that may create material financial risk 
we do  however  provide services under fixed price labor hour and fixed price level of effort contracts  which represent similar levels of risk as time and materials contracts 
our contract mix was approximately time and materials  cost plus and fixed price a substantial majority of which are firm fixed price level of effort during the year ended december  the contract mix can change over time depending on contract awards and acquisitions 
under cost plus contracts with the us federal government  operating profits are statutorily limited to but typically range from to 
under fixed price and time and materials contracts  margins are not subject to statutory limits 
however  the us federal government s objective in negotiating such contracts is to seldom allow for operating profits in excess of and  due to competitive pressures  operating profits on such contracts are often less than 
we maintain reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable which may arise in the normal course of business 
historically  we have not had significant write offs of uncollectible accounts receivable 
however  we do perform work on many contracts and task orders  where on occasion issues may arise  which would lead to accounts receivable not being fully collected 
costs of revenues our costs are categorized as either direct or indirect costs 
direct costs are those that can be identified with and allocated to specific contracts and tasks 
they include labor  fringe vacation time  medical dental  k plan matching contribution  tuition assistance  employee welfare  worker s compensation and other benefits  subcontractor costs  consultant fees  travel expenses and materials 
indirect costs are either overhead or general and administrative expenses 
indirect costs cannot be identified with specific contracts or tasks  and to the extent that they are allowable  they are allocated to contracts and tasks using appropriate government approved methodologies 
costs determined to be unallowable under the federal acquisition regulations cannot be allocated to projects 
our principal unallowable costs are interest expense  amortization expense for separately identified intangibles from acquisitions and certain general and administrative expenses 
a key element to our success has been our ability to control indirect and unallowable costs  enabling us to profitably execute our existing contracts and successfully bid for new contracts 
in addition  with the acquisition of new companies  we have been able to manage our indirect costs and improve operating margins by integrating the indirect cost structures and realizing opportunities for cost synergies 
costs of revenues are considered to be a critical accounting policy because of the direct relationship to revenue recognized 
goodwill impairment goodwill relating to our acquisitions represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired  and has a carrying amount of approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the majority of the increase in goodwill in was related to the acquisitions of sti and imsi in july and august  respectively 
we completed our annual impairment analyses as of september  and  noting no indications of impairment for any of our reporting units 
as of december   there have been no events or circumstances that would indicate an impairment test should be performed sooner than our planned annual test as of september  long lived assets and identifiable intangible asset impairment the carrying amount of long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
of the million at december   approximately million of the assets are related to our recent acquisitions of sti and imsi 
long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets  excluding goodwill  are evaluated for impairment when events occur that suggest that such assets may be impaired 
such events could include  but are not limited to  the loss of a significant customer or contract  decreases in us federal government appropriations or funding of certain programs  or other similar events 
none of these events occurred for the year ended december  we determine if an impairment has occurred based on a comparison of the carrying amount of such assets to the future undiscounted net cash flows  excluding charges for interest 
if considered impaired  the impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair value  as determined by an analysis of discounted cash flows using a discounted interest rate based on our cost of capital and the related risks of recoverability 
during the year ended december   we recognized an impairment charge of approximately  included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations  to write down the carrying value of a building held for sale to its estimated fair market value 
in evaluating impairment  we consider  among other things  our ability to sustain our current financial performance on contracts and tasks  our access to and penetration of new markets and customers and the duration of  and estimated amounts from  our contracts 
any uncertainty of future financial performance is dependent on our ability to maintain our customers and the continued funding of our contracts and tasks by the government 
over the past four years  we have been able to win the majority of our contracts that have been recompeted 
in addition  we have been able to sustain financial performance through indirect cost savings from our acquisitions  which have generally resulted in either maintaining or improving margins on our contracts and tasks 
if we are required to record an impairment charge in the future  it would have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
business combinations we apply the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  whereby the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their estimated fair market values at the acquisition date 
the purchase price in excess of the estimated fair market value of the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired represents goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price related to our business combinations involves significant estimates and management judgement that may be adjusted during the allocation period  but in no case beyond one year from the acquisition date 
costs incurred related to successful business combinations are capitalized as costs of business combinations  while costs incurred by us for unsuccessful or terminated acquisition opportunities are expensed when we determine that such opportunities will no longer be pursued 
costs incurred related to probable business combinations are deferred 
statements of operations the following is a description of certain line items from our audited consolidated statements of operations  which include the acquisitions of imsi  sti and isi since the dates of the acquisitions 
costs of revenues include direct labor and fringe costs for program personnel and direct expenses incurred to complete contracts and task orders 
costs of revenues also include depreciation  overhead  and other direct contract costs  which include subcontract work  consultant fees  and materials 
overhead consists of indirect costs relating to operational managers  rent facilities  administration  travel and other expenses 
general and administrative expenses are primarily for corporate functions such as management  legal  finance and accounting  contracts and administration  human resources  company management information systems and depreciation  and also include other unallowable costs such as marketing  certain legal fees and reserves 
amortization expenses relate to the costs associated with intangible assets from our acquisitions 
these intangible assets represent the fair value assigned to contract backlog and customer relationships as part of our acquisitions 
amortization expenses also include costs associated with certain non compete agreements related to the isi acquisition 
other income is from non core business items such as gains on the sales of businesses  fair market value adjustments to the retirement savings plan and a settlement agreement we entered into with the former owners of sherikon  which resulted in our paying a reduced amount of the subordinated note payable 
secondary offering expenses relate to costs associated with the selling of our common stock in underwritten offerings during the years ended december  and the company sold no shares and received no proceeds in these offerings 
therefore  we were required to classify the related costs as expenses 
interest expense is primarily related to our term loans and revolving credit facility  our subordinated debt  our senior subordinated notes which were due in  or the notes  interest rate swaps and amortization of deferred financing costs 
none of our notes remained outstanding after june funded backlog and estimated remaining contract value each year a significant portion of our revenue is derived from existing contracts with our government customers  and a portion of the revenue represents work related to maintenance  upgrade or replacement of systems under contracts or projects for which we are the incumbent provider 
proper management of contracts is critical to our overall financial success and we believe that effective management of costs makes us competitive on price 
historically  we believe that our demonstrated performance record and service excellence have enabled us to maintain our position as an incumbent service provider on more than of our contracts that have been recompeted 
we have increased our estimated remaining contract value by approximately million  from billion as of december   to billion at december   of which approximately million was funded backlog as of december  funded backlog increased approximately million to million at december   from million as of december  our estimated remaining contract value represents the aggregate contract revenue we estimate will be earned over the remaining life of our contracts 
when more than one company is awarded a contract for a given work requirement  we include in estimated remaining contract value only our estimate of the contract revenue we expect to earn over the remaining term of the contract 
funded backlog is based upon amounts actually appropriated by a customer for payment for goods and services 
because the us federal government operates under annual appropriations  agencies of the us federal government typically fund contracts on an incremental basis 
accordingly  the majority of the estimated remaining contract value is not funded backlog 
our estimated remaining contract value is based on our experience under contracts and we believe our estimates are reasonable 
however  there can be no assurance that our existing contracts will result in actual revenues in any particular period or at all 
these amounts could vary depending upon government budgets and appropriations 
acquisitions  divestitures and business closures the following table summarizes our acquisitions  divestitures and business closures since january revenues for the most recently completed twelve month period ended prior name status acquisition date to acquisition in thousands acquisitions isi acquired may  sti acquired july  imsi acquired august  revenues for the twelve months ended prior to name status divestiture closure date divestiture closure in thousands divestitures closures displaycheck sold april acquisitions we have completed and integrated eight strategic acquisitions since since january  we have acquired three businesses information spectrum  inc  simulation technologies inc  and integrated management services  inc

divestitures closures displaycheck through our acquisition of a t in june  we acquired expertise in electronic testing of liquid crystal displays and other microdisplay products that utilize liquid crystal on silicon technologies 
this newly emergent market was pursued to determine business feasibility 
while we were successful in generating a limited amount of revenue from our test equipment products  we decided not to make any further investments in this market 
operations ceased in august operating losses of  on revenues of  were incurred in the year ended december  displaycheck generated an operating loss of  on revenue of  in on april   we sold all of the assets and transferred certain liabilities of the business for an aggregate sale price of  results of operations our historical consolidated financial statements do not reflect the full year impact of the operating results of a number of our acquisitions  divestitures and closures  since their operating results are only included or excluded from our results from the date of acquisition  divestiture or closure  as applicable 
the following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations based on the amounts and percentage relationship of the items listed to revenues during the period shown years ended december  in thousands  except percentages revenues    costs of revenues    gross profit    costs and expenses general and administrative

we define organic growth as the increase in revenues excluding the revenues associated with acquisitions  divestitures and closures of businesses in comparable periods 
we believe organic growth is a useful supplemental measure to revenue 
management uses organic growth as part of its evaluation of core operating results and underlying trends 
for the year ended december   our organic growth was  or million 
the acquisitions of sti and imsi accounted for approximately million of the revenue growth for the year ended december  the increase in revenues attributable to organic growth was primarily driven by growth in the following business areas task orders in support of a wide range of federal government agencies under our gsa answer and management and business services mobis contracts  engineering and technical services for deploying enabling technologies with the us navy  engineering and technical support to the us army s program executive office for simulation  training and instrumentation  foreign military sales logistics support  and task orders under our naval sea systems command navsea multiple award contract 
costs of revenues for the year ended december   costs of revenues increased by million  or  to billion from million for year ended december  the increase in costs of revenues was due in part to the corresponding growth in revenues resulting from organic growth and the acquisition of sti and imsi and the increase in employee headcount 
the majority of the increase in costs of revenues for the year ended december  was due to increases of million and million in direct labor and other direct contract costs  respectively 
gross profit for the year ended december   gross profit increased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  gross profit for the year ended december   as a percentage of revenues remained relatively consistent 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   as a percentage of revenues  decreased to from 
this decline in the percentage of revenues was driven primarily by operational cost efficiencies achieved in connection with acquisitions and their successful integration 
the dollar increase was primarily attributable to the corresponding growth in revenues and additional expenses related to compliance with provisions of  and rules promulgated in connection with  section of the sarbanes oxley act of amortization for the year ended december   amortization expenses increased  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in amortization expense was a result of additional amortization related to intangible assets acquired in connection with the purchase of sti and imsi

other income for the year ended december   other income was  as compared to zero for the year ended december  the increase in other income was primarily related to a settlement agreement we entered into in july with the former owners of sherikon  a company we acquired in october under the provisions of the settlement agreement  the principal amount of the subordinated note payable was reduced from million to million  and we paid the reduced note amount  without interest 
this resulted in other income of approximately  net of legal expenses 
interest expense  net for the year ended december   interest expense  net of interest income  decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the repurchase of our notes and the refinancing of our credit facility 
in december  we reduced the balance on our notes to approximately million from million by utilizing the proceeds from the million in term loan b borrowings made under the credit facility 
in june  we repurchased the remaining million principal amount outstanding of our notes 
in conjunction with the repurchase in  we paid a tender premium of  which was included in interest for in  we incurred a million bond premium and consent payment   of fees and wrote off million of deferred financing fees to interest expense 
secondary offering expenses on october   affiliates of and companies managed by caxton iseman capital  inc  including azimuth technologies  lp  azimuth tech ii llc and frederick j 
iseman  which we refer to collectively as the caxton iseman stockholders  sold  shares of our common stock in an underwritten offering pursuant to a shelf registration statement on form s filed with the sec commission file no 

neither we nor any of our executive officers participated in the sale of shares in this offering 
in connection with this offering  we incurred  of expenses for the year ended december   for which we were not reimbursed in accordance with the terms of our registration rights agreement with certain of our stockholders  as amended 
on september   certain of our stockholders  including caxton iseman stockholders  sold  shares of our common stock in an underwritten offering pursuant to a registration statement on form s filed with the sec commission file nos 
and 
in the fourth quarter of  the underwriters of this offering partially exercised their over allotment option with respect to additional shares held by the selling stockholders 
as a result  on october   certain of the selling stockholders sold an additional  shares of our common stock in a second closing pursuant to the same underwritten offering 
in connection with this offering  we incurred approximately  of expenses for the year ended december   which amounts were reimbursed by certain of the selling stockholders and recorded by us as an expense and a contribution to additional paid in capital 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was  compared with for the year ended december  the effective tax rate reflects a benefit for federal research and experimentation credits from amending prior years tax returns  state legislative changes and a non recurring benefit from nontaxable other income resulting from the settlement with the former owners of sherikon  which resulted in a stock basis difference  for which a deferred tax liability was not required to be recorded 
compared with revenues for the year ended december   revenues increased by million  or  to billion from million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues was attributable to organic growth and the acquisition of isi 
for the year ended december   our organic growth was  or million 
the acquisition of isi accounted for approximately million of the growth for the year ended december  the increase in revenue was primarily driven by growth in the following contracts saftas  battlefield information collection exploitation systems  contracts with the us army for military operations on urban terrain  answer  our professional engineering services schedule contract  our other gsa contracts  and contracts with dhs 
in  approximately of our revenues were derived from dhs 
in addition  our revenues derived from dod increased from approximately in to in costs of revenues for the year ended december   costs of revenues increased by million  or  to million from million for year ended december  the increase in costs of revenues was due in part to the corresponding growth in the revenues resulting from organic growth and the acquisition of isi 
the majority of the increase in costs of revenues for the year ended december  was due to increases of million  million  and million in direct labor  fringe costs  and other direct contract costs  respectively 
the increases in direct labor  fringe costs and other direct contract costs were offset in part by reductions in certain overhead expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   as a percentage of revenues  decreased to from 
this decline in the percentage of revenues was driven primarily by operational cost efficiencies achieved in connection with the isi acquisition and its successful integration 
the dollar increase was primarily attributable to the corresponding growth in revenues 
amortization for the year ended december   amortization expenses increased  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in amortization expense was a result of additional amortization related to intangible assets acquired in connection with the purchase of isi and a related non compete agreement

excluding the interest expense related to our refinancing including the million bond premium and consent payment for our notes  the write off of million of deferred financing fees  and  of fees  interest expense for the year ended december  would have been approximately million  which would have represented a decrease from our debt balance as of december  exceeds the debt balance as of december  the debt balance increased due to million in new term loan borrowings made under the credit facility offset  in part  by the repayment of approximately million in existing term loans and million in our notes 
this amendment and restatement is discussed further in liquidity and capital resources 
secondary offering expenses in connection with an underwritten offering of approximately  shares of our common stock by certain of our stock holders  we incurred approximately  of expenses for the year ended december   which amounts were reimbursed by certain of the selling stockholders and recorded by us as a contribution to additional paid in capital 
other income we did not have any other income for the year ended december  other income for the year ended december  included a gain on the sale of displaycheck assets and receipt of insurance proceeds for misappropriated equipment previously recorded as a loss 
provision for income taxes as a result of certain non deductible secondary offering expenses referred to above  state legislative changes and other federal and state credits and incentives  our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was  compared with for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources cash flow for the years ended december  and we generated million in cash from operations for the year ended december  by comparison  we generated million in cash from operations for the year ended december  accounts receivable days sales outstanding  or dso  increased to days for the year ended december  from days for the year ended december  the day increase in dso is largely the result of payment delays related to customer process changes 
contract receivables increased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  accounts receivable at december  represented of total assets at that date 
as a result of our acquisitions of sti and imsi  accounts receivable increased by approximately million 
the remaining increase was attributable to the overall growth of our business and the increase in dso 
for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was million  which was attributable primarily to our acquisitions of sti and imsi 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily related to the borrowings under our existing credit facility 
prior to september   our credit facility provided  among other things  a term loan b in the amount of million with a maturity date of december   and the extension of the maturity date of the revolving loan portion of our credit facility to december  in addition  the credit facility permits us to raise up to million of additional debt in the form of additional term loans  subordinated debt or revolving loans with certain restrictions on the amount of revolving loans 
all borrowings under our credit facility are subject to financial covenants customary for such financings  including  but not limited to maximum ratio of net debt to ebitda and maximum ratio of senior debt to ebitda  as defined in the credit facility 
for the year ended december   we complied with all of the financial covenants 
additionally  as a result of changes made in the amendment and restatement  revolving loans are now based upon an asset test or maximum ratio of net eligible accounts receivable to revolving loans 
historically  our primary liquidity requirements have been for debt service under our credit facility and notes and for acquisitions and working capital requirements 
we have funded these requirements primarily through internally generated operating cash flow and funds borrowed under our existing credit facility 
on september   we entered into a second amendment to our credit facility 
this amendment provided an additional million of borrowing by increasing our term loan b to million  and lowered the interest rates on term loan b borrowings by 
the additional million in borrowings did not reduce the million in potential additional borrowings described below 
as of december   total debt outstanding was million  consisting of million of term loan b  and million outstanding under the revolving loan portion of our credit facility 
the total funds available to us under the revolving loan portion of our credit facility as of december  were million 
under certain conditions related to excess annual cash flow  as defined in our credit facility  and the receipt of proceeds from certain asset sales and debt or equity issuances  we are required to prepay  in amounts specified in our credit facility  borrowings under the term loan b 
our principal working capital need is for funding accounts receivable  which has increased with the growth of our business 
for the year ended december   working capital increased by million to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in working capital was primarily the result of the increase in dso referenced above 
our principal sources of cash to fund our working capital needs are cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
in addition  we are scheduled to pay quarterly installments of  under the term loan b until the credit facility matures on december  as of december   we did not have any capital commitments greater than million 
we have relatively low capital investment requirements 
capital expenditures were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily for leasehold improvements and office equipment 
our business acquisition expenditures relating to sti and imsi were million in the acquisitions were financed through borrowings under our credit facility 
in the past  we have engaged in acquisition activity  and we intend to do so in the future 
historically  we have financed our acquisitions through a combination of bank debt  subordinated debt  subordinated public and private debt and equity investments 
we expect to be able to finance any future acquisitions either with cash provided from operations  borrowings under our credit facility  bank loans  equity offerings  or some combination of the foregoing 
we intend to  and expect over the next twelve months to be able to  fund our operating cash  capital expenditure and debt service requirements through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
over the longer term  our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance  which will be affected by a range of economic  competitive and business factors  many of which are outside our control
