in  we raised net proceeds of million 
this includes million of net funds from the sale of class a common stock in january  million of net funds from the april issuance of our senior secured floating rate notes due and million of net funds from the november issuance of our convertible senior notes due  and million in cash proceeds in connection with gm s exercise of a warrant to purchase million shares of our class a common stock at an exercise price of per share 
in january  we received an additional million in net proceeds from the exercise of the over allotment option on the november issuance of our convertible senior notes due from january  to december   we eliminated  repaid or redeemed million of carrying value  including accrued interest  of debt and preferred securities  or approximately million face value at maturity  through the issuance of million shares of class a common stock and the payment of million of cash 
in total  these de leveraging transactions eliminated over million in future interest  dividends  accretion and principal payments as well as million shares of incremental potential dilution 
during  we settled with insurers representing approximately of the insurance coverage on xm rock and xm roll for a total recovery of approximately million 
provided that we meet the revenue  expense and cash flow projections of our business plan  we expect to be fully funded and will not need to raise additional financing to continue operations 
we will continue to incur operating losses until we substantially increase the number of our subscribers and develop a stream of cash flow sufficient to cover operating costs 
we are focused on managing growth and containing costs while increasing subscribers and scaling processes 
we also have significant outstanding contracts and commercial commitments that need to be paid in cash or through credit facilities over the next several years  including to fund subsidies and distribution costs  particularly under our arrangement with general motors  programming costs  repayment of long term debt  lease payments and service payments  as further described below under the heading liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
our ability to become profitable also depends upon other factors identified below under the heading liquidity and capital resources future operating and capital resource requirements 
inc was incorporated in delaware in and xm became a holding company in early we emerged from the development stage in the fourth quarter of  following the commencement of our service in two test markets on september  and nationwide launch on november  this annual report on form k is filed by xm satellite radio holdings inc xm 
xm satellite radio inc inc 
is filing separately 
the principal differences between the financial condition of xm and inc  which are not significant in amount  are the ownership by xm of the corporate headquarters building since august  and the lease of the building from xm by inc  the presence at xm of additional indebtedness not guaranteed by inc  and the existence of cash balances at xm 

table of contents accordingly  the results of operations for inc and its subsidiaries are substantially the same as the results for xm and its subsidiaries discussed above except that inc incurs additional rent  less depreciation and amortization expense and less other income  in each case principally related to inc s rental of its corporate headquarters from xm  which are intercompany transactions that have been eliminated in the xm financial statements  less interest expense principally related to the additional indebtedness at xm  and less interest income because of the additional cash balances at xm 
results of operations to explain our performance  we discuss our results of operations using the following revenue and expense categories that reflect the drivers of the business 
subscription revenue subscription includes revenues from basic and premium services  net of subscription related promotions 
activation revenue activation includes amortization of subscription activation fees over the estimated average life of a subscriber 
equipment revenue equipment includes revenue from xm s direct sales of radios  radio accessories  merchandise and any related shipping fees 
net ad sales revenue net ad sales includes revenue from sales of advertisements and programming sponsorships to advertisers on the xm radio network  net of agency commissions 
cost of revenue costs of revenue are those expenses directly related to the generation of subscriber and advertising revenue and have variable and fixed components 
cost of equipment  revenue share royalties  along with customer care billing tend to fluctuate along with increases and decreases in revenues and or subscribers 
ad sales  which includes internal and external costs directly associated with selling advertisements on the xm network  tends to fluctuate with increases and decreases in advertising revenue 
satellite terrestrial  broadcast operations and programming content are not expected to fluctuate directly with changes in revenue and or subscribers 
research development research development is a discretionary expense used primarily to drive new product development and radio component and radio unit cost reductions 
general administrative general administrative expenses include legal  human resources  accounting and other overhead costs 

table of contents marketing marketing includes retention support  which are those indirect costs  primarily labor  that are not associated with gaining a subscriber and are not expected to fluctuate directly with changes in revenue and or subscribers  subsidies distribution  which includes commissions to radio manufacturers and distribution partners that are based on the number of radios or vehicles manufactured or the number of new subscribers added in the period  marketing  which are those discretionary costs including advertising  media and events  as well as marketing materials for retail and automotive dealer points of presence 
amortization of the gm liability includes the straight line accounting treatment of the fixed obligation to general motors 
we consider subscriber acquisition costs sac to include radio manufacturer subsidies  certain sales  activation and installation commissions  and hardware related promotions 
these costs are reported in subsidies distribution on the consolidated statement of operations 
subscriber acquisition costs also include the negative margins on equipment sales 
subscriber acquisition costs do not include ongoing loyalty payments to retailers and distribution partners  payments under revenue sharing arrangements with radio manufacturers and distributors and the amortization of the gm liability 
we consider cost per gross addition cpga to include the amounts in sac  as well as advertising  media and marketing expenses except for retention and support and the amortization of the gm liability 
ebitda net loss before interest income  interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization is commonly referred to in our business as ebitda 
ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles

table of contents as xm activated vehicles for which we have a contractual right to receive payment for the use of our service 
radios that are revenue generating are counted individually as subscribers 
oem promotional subscribers 
oem promotional subscribers are subscribers who have either a portion or all of their subscription fee paid for by an oem for a fixed period following the initial purchase or lease of the vehicle 
currently  at the time of sale  vehicle owners generally receive a month prepaid trial subscription 
xm generally receives two months of the month trial subscription from the vehicle manufacturer 
promotional periods generally include the period of trial service plus days to handle the receipt and processing of payments 
the automated activation program provides activated xm radios on dealer lots for test drives 
gm and honda generally indicate the inclusion of months free of xm service on the window sticker of xm enabled vehicles 
we measure the success of these programs based on the percentage that elect to receive the xm service and convert to self paying subscribers after the initial promotion period we refer to this as the conversion rate 
the oems started to offer promotional programs in late at that time  the xm enabled vehicles were delivered to the dealers with inactive radios 
dealers or vehicle purchasers were required to call xm to activate a radio similar to an aftermarket consumer customer  not all xm enabled vehicles were activated for the promotional subscription period 
to streamline the process  in late september  we began implementing an auto activation program whereby the xm radios are being activated automatically upon delivery of the car to the dealer 
in the first quarter of  we started activating xm radios at the completion of the car manufacturing process  which further reduces manual intervention in the process 
under our oem promotional programs that ran from late through mid september the primary program was the gm triple play promotion  subscribers were included in our oem promotional subscriber count from the time of sign up on the system until such time as they transferred into our aftermarket  oem and other subscriber count or were deactivated for non payment in accordance with our normal collection procedures 
under the auto activation programs  subscribers are included in our oem promotional subscriber count from the time of vehicle purchase or lease  through the period of trial service plus an additional days 
we measure conversion rate three months after the period in which the trial service ends 
based on our experience it may take up to days after the trial service ends for subscribers to respond to our marketing communications 
the conversion rate for the gm triple play program that ran through mid september averaged approximately 
the conversion rate for the year ended december  was and reflects the auto activation program  with all xm enabled vehicles activated for the promotional period 
the fully automated factory activation program has increased the number of subscribers provided by our oem distribution channel  and we are focused on increasing the conversion rate by developing more refined marketing programs to convert promotional subscribers to self paying subscribers 
xm activated vehicles with rental car companies 
our subscribers also include  activated vehicles with rental car companies 
for the initial model year xm enabled rental vehicles  xm receives payments based on the use of xm service 
customers are charged per day per vehicle for use of the xm service  on which xm receives a revenue share 
for subsequent model year and later vehicles  xm receives per subscription per month 
subscription revenue 
subscription revenue was million during compared to million in  an increase of million 
subscription revenue consists primarily of our monthly subscription fees charged to consumers  commercial establishments and fleets  which are recognized as the service is provided 
revenues received from vehicle manufacturers for promotional service programs are included in subscription revenue 
at the time of sale  vehicle owners generally receive a three month trial subscription and are included in oem promotional subscribers 
beginning in  a standard promotion of months free was placed on the window sticker of all xm enabled gm vehicles 
we generally receive payment for two months of the three month trial subscription period from the vehicle manufacturer 
for  subscription revenue included million from related parties for subscription fees paid under certain promotional agreements  compared with million in subscription revenue also includes revenues from premium channels and weather services 
our 
table of contents subscriber arrangements are cancelable without penalty 
promotions and discounts are treated as a reduction to revenue during the period of the promotion 
sales incentives  consisting of rebates to subscribers  offset revenue 
discounts on equipment sold with service are allocated to equipment and service based on relative fair value 
in february  we announced that we are expanding our basic service package and that the monthly subscription price for our basic service will increase to from beginning april  existing customers may lock in a discounted rate by signing up for a pre paid plan of up to five years prior to april  the expanded basic service will include the internet service xm radio online previously per month and the high voltage channel previously per month  both of which were premium services prior to this change 
average monthly subscription revenue per subscriber 
average monthly subscription revenue per subscriber arpu was approximately during and during arpu from our aftermarket  oem and other subscribers was during  compared to during the difference from our retail rate of is due primarily to multi year prepayment plan and family plan discounts 
arpu from our oem promotional subscribers was during  compared to during arpu from our rental car fleet subscribers was during  compared to during average monthly subscription revenue per subscriber is derived from the total of earned subscription revenue net of promotions and rebates divided by the monthly weighted average number of subscribers for the period reported 
average monthly revenue per subscriber is a measure of operational performance and not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
average monthly revenue per subscriber will fluctuate based on promotions implemented in  as well as the adoption rate of multiyear prepayment plans  multiradio discount plans such as the family plan  premium and data services 
we expect that average monthly revenue per subscriber will increase in the increase in the monthly subscription price takes effect for all billing cycles on or after april   and therefore  will be implemented over time 
activation revenue 
activation revenue is comprised of one time activation charges billed to customers 
activation fees are non refundable  and are recognized on a pro rata basis over the estimated month life of the subscriber relationship 
this estimate may be further refined in the future as additional historical data becomes available

the growth in activation revenue will be impacted by the amount of discounts given as a result of the competitive environment  as well as changes  if any  in the estimated life of the subscriber relationship 
equipment revenue 
equipment revenue is comprised of revenues from any direct sales of radios 
through december   the direct sales of radios have generally been for promotional purposes 
during  we recognized million in equipment revenue compared to million during for  equipment revenue included  from direct sales of radios to related parties compared with million in related to a one time promotion that ended in we expect revenue from the sale of equipment to increase proportionately with the increase in direct sales promotional activities as well as kiosk sales 
net ad sales revenue

personnel related expenses comprise the majority of retention and support 
in  these costs were million compared to million in  an increase of million or 
the increase is due to an increase in headcount and costs for professional services 
subsidies distribution 
we currently provide incentives and subsidies for the manufacture  purchase  installation and activation of xm radios to attract and retain our manufacturing and distribution partners 
our subsidy and distribution costs are significant and totaled approximately million during  compared with million during  an increase of million or 
this increase is due 
table of contents primarily to the increase in subscribers  new activations  and gm vehicles equipped with xm radios 
subsidy and distribution expense will increase as the number of xm radios that are manufactured  installed and activated increase  however  we expect the cost per new subscriber to decrease slightly 
subscriber acquisition costs 
we consider subscriber acquisition costs to include radio manufacturer subsidies  certain sales  activation and installation commissions  and hardware related promotions 
these costs are reported in subsidies distribution 
the negative margins from equipment sales are also included in subscriber acquisition costs 
subscriber acquisition costs do not include ongoing loyalty payments to retailers and distribution partners  payments under revenue sharing arrangements with radio manufacturers and distributors and certain guaranteed payments to general motors 
during the years ended december   and  we incurred expenses of million  and million  respectively  related to subscriber acquisition costs 
our average subscriber acquisition cost was and during and  respectively 
the decline in sac for as compared to is due primarily to the decline in manufacturer subsidies

activities comprising these expenses include media  advertising  events and direct marketing programs 
advertising marketing costs were million during  compared with million during  an increase of million or 
the increase is due primarily to our increased retail marketing and media advertising expenses 
cost per gross addition

in our financial statements  sac costs are captured in subsidies distribution and the negative margins from equipment sales  while cpga costs are primarily captured by the combination of subsidies distribution  advertising marketing  plus the negative margins from equipment sales 
cpga does not include marketing staff included in retention support or the amortization of the gm guaranteed payments included in amortization of gm liability 
during the years ended december  and we incurred cpga expenses of million  and million  respectively 
cpga for and was and  respectively 
the decline in cpga for as compared to is due to the combined impacts of the declines in manufacturer subsidies  discretionary advertising and marketing expenses and an increase in the number of activations 
we expect cpga to decline slightly in amortization of gm liability 
these costs include the amortization of annual fixed guaranteed payment commitments to general motors  aggregating to million  under our long term distribution agreement with the onstar division of gm providing for the installation of xm radios in gm vehicles 
amortization of the gm liability was million for  compared with million for the distribution agreement was amended in june and then again in january  as described under the captions liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
as a result of the january amendment and gm s current roll out plans  commencing in february we began recognizing the fixed payments  which approximate million  on a straight line basis through september in january  we expensed the pro rata portion of the fixed payment that was based on the june amendment to the agreement 
we expect these expenses to remain at million per annum through september depreciation amortization 
depreciation amortization expense was million during  compared with million during  a decrease of million or 
the decrease was due primarily to lower depreciation on xm rock and xm roll as a result of the august insurance proceeds of approximately million reducing the carrying values of our satellites in august depreciation and amortization expense is expected to increase in when xm is placed into service 
interest income 
interest income was million during  compared with million during  an increase of million or 
the increase was the result of higher average balances of cash and cash equivalents in as well as higher yields on our investments due to market conditions

other income consists primarily of income from rental of office space in our corporate headquarters to third parties 
other income was million in and million in provision for deferred income taxes 
we recorded a provision for deferred income taxes expense of million and during and the increase was the result of our recording of a deferred tax liability related to indefinite lived assets that are amortized and deducted for tax purposes but are not amortized under generally accepted accounting principles 
we will continue to incur tax expense as the indefinite lived assets are amortized for tax purposes over the next years 
net loss 
net loss for was million  compared with million for  an increase of million or 
the increase primarily reflects increases in operating expenses due to our subscriber growth  the provision for deferred income taxes and an increase in losses associated with de leveraging transactions  offset in part by the growth in our revenue and a decrease in interest expense 
ebitda 
net loss before interest income  interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization is commonly referred to in our business as ebitda 
ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
ebitda during was million  compared with million during included in ebitda are losses of million in and million in recorded from the deleveraging transactions 
the increased loss reflects our increase in operating costs as a result of our subscriber growth and increase in losses associated with de leveraging transactions  offset in part by revenue growth and margin improvement as well as a decline in the costs to acquire each new subscriber 
consistent with regulatory requirements  ebitda includes loss from deleveraging transactions and other income 
we believe ebitda is often a useful measure of a company s operating performance and is a significant basis used by our management to measure the operating performance of our business 
because we have funded and completed the build out of our system through the raising and expenditure of large amounts of capital  our results of operations reflect significant charges for depreciation  amortization and interest expense 
ebitda  which excludes this information  provides helpful information about the operating performance of our business  apart from the expenses associated with our physical plant or capital structure

ebitda does not purport to represent operating activities  as those terms are defined under generally accepted accounting principles  and should not be considered as an alternative to those measurements as an indicator of our performance 
the reconciliation of net loss to ebitda is as follows in thousands

our revenue consists of subscription fees  activation charges  limited direct sales of radios  advertising sales  and revenue earned from royalties and invoice fees 
in  we recognized million in total revenue  compared to million in  an increase of million 
during  subscription revenue comprised over of our total revenues 
subscribers 
as of december   we had  subscribers  compared to  at december   an increase of  subscribers 
our subscribers at december  included  self paying subscribers   subscribers in oem promotional periods typically ranging from three months to one year in duration paid for by the vehicle manufacturers and  xm activated vehicles with rental car companies 
at the time of sale  vehicle owners generally receive a month trial subscription and are included in oem promotional subscribers 
xm generally receives two months of the month trial subscription from the vehicle manufacturer 
the number of subscribers electing to continue with the xm service beyond the initial oem promotional period  the conversion rate  has ranged from through the end of and averaged approximately for beginning in late september  we began an interim auto activation program whereby xm enabled radios in new vehicles manufactured by general motors and honda are automatically activated to receive the xm service as a subscriber at the time of the sale to the vehicle purchaser 
in march  we began a fully automated factory activation program whereby xm enabled radios in new vehicles manufactured by general motors are activated to receive the xm service at the time of manufacture 
these vehicles are not included in our subscriber count until the vehicle is sold to a customer who becomes an oem promotional subscriber 
the fully automated factory activation program was initiated to streamline the process for activating the xm service in vehicles that previously required the auto manufacturers dealers to contact our listener care center 
the fully automated factory activation program also provides activated radios on the dealer lots for test drives 
in addition  gm will now provide standard on the window sticker months free of xm service with every xm enabled vehicle 
we expect that the implementation of the fully automated factory activation program will increase the number of subscribers provided by our oem distribution channel  but will result in a decline in our overall conversion rate due to a larger number of cars activated for trial service 
our subscribers also include  xm activated vehicles with rental car companies

future operating and capital resource requirements our funding requirements are based on our current business plan  which in turn is based on our operating experience to date and our available resources

our plan contemplates our focusing on the new automobile market where we have relationships with automobile manufacturers  the continuing introduction of lower priced and more user friendly radio technology in the retail aftermarket and the use of our most productive distribution channels 
we expect that our future working capital  capital expenditures  and debt service requirements will be satisfied from existing cash and cash equivalents and by cash generated from operations 
provided that we meet the revenue  expense and cash flow projections of our business plan  we expect to be fully funded and will not need to raise additional financing to continue operations

our costs may exceed or our revenues may fall short of our estimates  our estimates may change  and future developments may affect our estimates 
any of these factors may increase our need for funds  which would require us to seek additional financing to continue implementing our current business plan

with this plan  even if there is a problem putting xm into operation  we believe we will be able to launch additional satellites prior to the time the solar array output power degradation issue might cause our broadcast signal strength to fall below minimum acceptable levels 
satellite contract xm rock and xm roll 
as of december   we had paid approximately million  including financing charges and interest under the satellite contract related to xm rock  or xm  xm roll  or xm  xm and xm we originally entered into its satellite contract in march with boeing satellite systems international  inc  or bss  and have subsequently amended the contract  including in july and december under the satellite contract  bss has delivered two satellites in orbit  xm rock and xm roll  supplied ground equipment and software used in the xm radio system and provided certain launch and operations support services 
satellite contract and other costs xm construction of our xm satellite has been completed  including certain modifications to correct the solar array degradation issues experienced by xm rock and xm roll discussed below  as well as other changes agreed with bss discussed below 
as of december   with respect to xm  we have deferred million at an interest rate of through january  in may  
table of contents we repaid in full a million loan plus accrued interest outstanding from boeing capital 
in february we launched our xm satellite 
in addition to the modifications to address the solar array degradation issues  bss made certain alterations to optimize xm  launched in february  for the specific orbital slot into which it will be placed 
the aggregate remaining cost  excluding the above million deferral  of the launch  optimization for the specific orbital slot  appropriate software and certain pre and post launch services of approximately million was paid during the first half of further  bss has the right to earn performance incentive payments of up to million  excluding interest  based on the in orbit performance of xm over its design life of fifteen years 
satellite insurance xm in addition to the xm related costs noted above  we acquired and paid for launch and in orbit insurance in january in connection with the launch of xm satellite contract and other costs xm we have committed in our satellite contract  as amended in july  and by a separate august contract with sea launch company  llc  or sea launch  to acquire from bss a fourth satellite  xm  which should be available for shipment to the launch services provider by the end of  and from sea launch the associated launch services for the satellite 
the fixed prices for xm and the associated launch services total million  excluding in orbit performance incentives and financing charges on certain amounts deferred prior to launch 
as of december   satellite construction costs aggregating approximately million were incurred  of which million was paid  and million are deferred 
interest accrues monthly at a rate of per annum through december and is payable thereafter on a current basis  pursuant to the december amendment  which extended the deferral into early unless the satellite is launched earlier 
most of the remaining portion of the fixed costs for xm and the associated launch services are payable during construction with the last payment due one month following launch 
after launch of xm  bss has the right to earn performance incentive payments of up to million  plus interest  over the first twelve years of in orbit life  up to million for performance above specification during the first fifteen years of in orbit life  and up to million for continued high performance across the five year period beyond the fifteen year design life 
if xm operates satisfactorily  we may elect  under the above contracts  to defer launch of xm and  as a result  approximately million in payments related to launch services could be postponed until the timeframe 
options to procure fifth satellite and associated launch services 
we also have obtained fixed price options to acquire a fifth satellite from bss  under the july amendment  on pricing and performance incentive terms similar to those applicable to xm and associated launch services from sea launch under the august contract

the agreement is subject to renegotiation at any time based upon the installation of radios that are compatible with a common receiver platform or capable of receiving sirius satellite radio s service 
the agreement is subject to renegotiation if as of november  and at two year intervals thereafter  gm does not achieve and maintain specified installation levels of gm vehicles capable of receiving the company s service 
the specified installation level of  units by november was achieved in the specified installation levels in future years will increase by the lesser of  units per year or amounts proportionate to target market shares in the satellite digital radio service market 
there can be no assurances as to the outcome of any such renegotiations 
general motors exclusivity obligations will discontinue if  by november and at two year intervals thereafter  we fail to achieve and maintain specified minimum market share levels in the satellite digital radio service market

lease obligations 
we have noncancelable operating leases for office space and terrestrial repeater sites and noncancelable capital leases for equipment that expire over the next ten years 
in december  we determined that the planned number of terrestrial repeater sites could be reduced due to the relative signal strength provided by our satellites 
we recognized a charge of million with respect to terrestrial repeater sites no longer required

in connection with our granting to them of large supply contracts  some of these strategic companies have become large investors in us and have been granted rights to designate directors or observers to our board of directors 
the negotiation of these supply contracts and investments primarily occurred at or prior to the time these companies became related parties 
we are a party to a long term distribution agreement with onstar corporation  a subsidiary of general motors that provides for the installation of xm radios in general motors vehicles  as further described in note in connection with the development of our terrestrial repeater network  we were a party to a contract with hughes electronics corporation 
directv has provided consulting services in connection with the development of our customer care center and billing operations 
hughes and directv ceased to be related parties during the three month period ended march  we have arrangements with american honda relating to the promotion of the xm service to new car buyers  the use of bandwidth on the xm system and the development of telematics services and technologies

premiere radio networks  a subsidiary of clear channel communications  had served as one of our advertising sales representatives 
we also run advertisements on a spot and network basis on radio stations owned by clear channel 
in addition  we lease sites for our terrestrial repeaters from clear channel communications

as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include those pertaining to the following policies 
senior management has discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of estimates and assumptions required for the following accounting policies revenue recognition revenue from subscribers consists of our monthly subscription fee  which is recognized as the service is provided  and a non refundable activation fee  which is recognized on a pro rata basis over an estimated term of the subscriber relationship currently months  which was based upon market studies and management s judgment 
we expect to refine this estimate as more data becomes available 
promotions and discounts are treated as an offset to revenue during the period of promotion 
sales incentives  consisting of discounts and rebates to subscribers  offset earned revenue 
discounts to equipment which is sold with service are allocated to equipment and service based on relative fair value 
if the actual term of our subscriber relationships is significantly greater or less than our current estimate of months  the period over which we recognize the non refundable activation fee will be extended or shortened to reflect the actual term of our subscriber relationships 
subscription and activation revenue accounted for more than of our total revenue 
estimates of payments due to manufacturers and distributors payments owed to manufacturing and distribution partners are expensed during the month in which the manufacture  sale  and or activation of 
table of contents the radio unit occurs 
the amounts of these expenses are dependent upon units provided by our internal systems and processes  such as subscriber management system and supply chain management system and partner systems and processes 
however  due to lags in receiving manufacturing and sales data from partners  estimates of amounts due are necessary in order to record monthly expenses 
in subsequent months when lagged data is received from partners  expenses are reconciled  and adjusted where necessary 
since launching commercial operations  we continue to refine the estimation process based on an increased understanding of the timing lags  and close working relationships with our partners 
generally  estimates recorded on our books are adjusted to actuals within one month 
useful life of satellites and spacecraft control facilities following receipt of our satellites  we extended their expected lives from years  the initial design life  to years based upon updated technical estimates we received from our satellite provider following our satellite launches 
however  based on the consistency of the degradation trends with no substantial improvement to date and continuing analyses by boeing satellite systems and us  as described above under the heading liquidity and capital resources future operating and capital resource requirements  we adjusted the estimated useful life of our in orbit satellites with effect from september  to the period running through first quarter of approximately years from launch 
we continue to monitor the situation and may need to re adjust the estimated useful lives of our in orbit satellites based on future information 
we are not recording an impairment at this time  due to our forecasted cash flows which are sufficient to recover the system assets  however  should we reduce or not meet our forecasted cash flows or reduce further the estimated useful lives of the satellites  we may be required to record an impairment which may be substantial at that time 
an impairment  if recorded  would be calculated as the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows 
at december   the combined carrying value of xm and xm is million 
we have not adjusted the estimated useful lives of our spacecraft control facilities  as we believe that these facilities will continue to be used in our xm system 
a significant decrease in the estimated useful life of our satellites and spacecraft control facilities could have a material adverse impact on our operating results in the period in which the estimate is revised and in subsequent periods 
programming agreements we have entered into various programming agreements 
under the terms of these agreements  we are obligated to provide payments and commissions to other entities that may include fixed payments  advertising commitments and revenue sharing arrangements 
fixed amounts due under programming agreements are recognized on a straight line basis though the termination and or renegotiation date defined in the agreements 
revenue share agreements that contain minimum guarantees are recorded as an expense based upon the greater of the revenue share amount or a pro rata portion of the guarantee over the guarantee period 
distribution agreement with general motors we have significant payment obligations under our distribution agreement with general motors  which was amended on january  to provide that we could make certain payments by issuance of indebtedness or shares of class a common stock 
the agreement is subject to renegotiation if as of november  and at two year intervals thereafter  gm does not achieve and maintain specified installation levels of gm vehicles capable of receiving the company s service 
the specified installation level of  units by november was achieved in the specified installation levels in future years will increase by the lesser of  units per year or amounts proportionate to target market shares in the satellite digital radio service market 
in light of gm s initial roll out plans  the june amendment of the distribution agreement and management s assessment of the likelihood of renegotiating during the period ending  we recognized the fixed payment obligations due to gm for the period through november  which approximate million  on a straight line basis 
in light of the january amendment of the distribution agreement and gm s current roll out plans which demonstrate a likelihood of gm exceeding minimum installation targets  in we are prospectively recognizing fixed payment obligations to gm  which approximate million  on a straight line basis through the remaining term of the agreement in september additional fixed payment obligations beyond range 
table of contents from million to approximately million through  aggregating approximately million 
dars license 
we determined that our dars license was an intangible asset having an indefinite useful life 
while the dars license has a renewable eight year term  we believe that the administrative fees necessary to renew the license are expected to be de minimis compared to the initial fee to obtain the license  and we have met all of the established milestones specified in the dars license agreement 
we also anticipate no difficulties in renewing the license as long as we continue to adhere to the various regulatory requirements established in the license grant 
although we face competition from a variety of sources  we do not believe that the risk of the technology becoming obsolete or that a decrease in demand for the dars service is significant 
further  we believe that our license is comparable with the licenses granted to other broadcasters  which are also classified as indefinite lived intangible assets 
we understand that there continues to be deliberations concerning the application of this standard regarding the effect of the costs to renew fcc licenses 
our application of this standard could change depending upon the results of these deliberations 
subscriber count 
we consider subscribers to be those who are receiving and have agreed to pay for our service  either by credit card or by invoice  including those that are currently in promotional periods  as well as xm activated radios in vehicles for which we have a contractual right to receive payment for the use of our service 
radios that are revenue generating are counted individually as subscribers 
approximately of our subscribers at year end were in promotional periods with sponsored accounts 
a change in our methodology of counting subscribers that excluded subscribers in promotional periods with sponsored accounts would delay the timing of the recognition of the subscriber until the end of the promotional period  which is generally months 
subscribers with delinquent account balances are included in the subscriber count until such time as the radio is deactivated for non payment in accordance with our normal procedures 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas r requires recognition of compensation expense for stock options granted to employees 
the expense is equal to the grant date fair value of the options granted  and the expense is recorded over the vesting period 
xm s employee stock purchase plan espp is also considered compensatory under the new standard  because we offer a discount greater than and a look back option 
we are in the process of evaluating whether we should make modifications to our espp 
xm is required to adopt sfas r in the rd quarter of compensation expense will need to be recorded for new option awards and for the remaining vesting period of existing option grants 
we expect that compensation expense of approximately million will be recorded in the second half of from the vesting of existing option grants 
the amount of compensation expense that we record after adoption of sfas r in and beyond will depend on the amount and timing of option activity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we do not have any derivative financial instruments 
we do not hold or issue any free standing derivatives 
we invest our cash in short term commercial paper  investment grade corporate and government obligations and money market funds 
we have existing obligations related to our long term debt agreements 
as of december   we did not have significant cash flow exposure to changing interest rates on our long term debt because the interest rates of the majority of those securities are fixed 
however  the estimated fair value of the fixed rate debt is subject to market risk 
as of december   we had approximately million in fixed rate debt 
we run the risk that market rates will decline and the required payments will exceed those based on current market rates 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 

table of contents presented below is an analysis of our financial instruments as of december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the tables demonstrate the change in market value of the instruments calculated for an instantaneous parallel shift in interest rates  plus or minus basis points  or bps  bps and bps 
with respect to our fixed rate debt  the sensitivity table below illustrates market values  or the price at which the debt would trade should interest rates fall or rise in the range indicated  assuming similar terms and similar assessment of risk by our lenders 
market values are determined using quoted market prices or market rates on comparable instruments as of december  interest rate risk in millions as of december  valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of x basis points no change in interest rates valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of x basis points bps bps bps fair value bps bps bps senior secured notes due senior secured discount notes due senior secured notes due convertible senior notes due mortgage this sensitivity analysis provides only a limited  point in time view of the market risk sensitivity of certain of our financial instruments 
the actual impact of market interest rate changes on our financial instruments may differ significantly from the impact shown in the sensitivity analysis 
the senior secured discount convertible notes due  with an estimated combined fair value of approximately billion at december  are not included in the above analysis as the fair value of the notes is not significantly exposed to interest rate changes 
the holders of the notes may convert their notes into class a common stock at a conversion price of per share at any time prior to maturity 
due to the conversion feature of the instrument  coupled with the current price of our class a common stock  the fair value of the notes is linked largely to the price of class a common stock 
included in our fixed rate debt are million of capital leases and notes payable that are not included in the analysis as the carrying amounts approximate fair value because of their short maturity 
as of december   we had million of variable rate debt  an increase of million from december  accordingly  any changes in interest rates would be more significant as of december  in comparison to december  a change of one percentage point in the interest rate applicable to the million of variable rate debt at december  would result in a fluctuation of approximately million in our annual interest expense 
we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is not material to our results of operations
