item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction terra industries inc produces and markets nitrogen products for agricultural and industrial markets with production facilities located in north america and the united kingdom 
in addition  we own a interest in an ammonia production joint venture in the republic of trinidad and tobago 
nitrogen products are commodity chemicals that are sold at prices reflecting global supply and demand conditions 
the nitrogen products industry has cycles of oversupply  resulting in lower prices and idled capacity  followed by supply shortages  resulting in high selling prices and higher industry wide production rates 
to be viable in this industry  a producer must be among the low cost suppliers in the markets it serves and have a financial position that can sustain it during periods of oversupply 
on december   we acquired mississippi chemical corporation 
in order to achieve the full benefits of this acquisition  our management will emphasize the successful integration of mcc s business with ours in a timely manner 
natural gas is the most significant raw material in the production of nitrogen products 
north american natural gas costs have increased substantially since since some of our products compete with nitrogen products imported from regions with lower natural gas costs  we and other north american producers have not been able to increase selling prices to levels necessary to cover the natural gas cost increases 
this has resulted in curtailments of north american nitrogen production 
these curtailments contributed to reductions in global nitrogen product supplies 
imports  most of which are produced at facilities with access to fixed price natural gas supplies  account for a significant portion of us nitrogen product supply 
imported products natural gas costs have been and could continue to be substantially lower than the delivered cost of natural gas to our facilities 
off shore producers are most competitive in regions close to north american points of entry for imports  including the gulf coast and east coast 
our sales volumes depend primarily on our plants operating rates 
we may purchase product from other manufacturers or importers for resale  but gross margins on those volumes are rarely significant 
profitability and cash flows from our nitrogen products business are affected by our ability to manage our costs and expenses other than natural gas  most of which do not materially change for different levels of production or sales 
other factors affecting our nitrogen products results include the number of planted acres  transportation costs  weather conditions particularly during planting season  grain prices and other variables described in items and business and properties of this annual report on form k 

table of contents we also produce methanol in the us similar to nitrogen products  methanol is a commodity chemical manufactured from natural gas 
consequently  natural gas costs and the supply demand balance for methanol significantly affect methanol earnings and cash flows 
a significant portion of us methanol demand is met by imports from regions with natural gas costs lower than those available to us producers 
us methanol demand has declined over the past year and is expected to continue to decline due to reduced us consumption of mtbe  a gasoline oxygenate and octane enhancer that uses methanol as a feedstock 
in december  we entered into contracts with the methanex corporation methanex assigning it our sales contracts and providing it exclusive rights to all methanol production at the beaumont facility for five years as more fully described in items and business and properties of this report 
as permitted under these contracts  methanex elected to shut down the beaumont facility as of december  as long as the beaumont facility remains idle through the december termination of the methanex contract  we will continue to realize revenues relating to the facility of up to million per year due to million from annual amortization of deferred revenues plus one half of the annual cash margin based on the plant s methanol production capacity  methanol reference prices and natural gas costs 
overview of consolidated results terra reported net income loss of million in  million in and million in with diluted earnings loss per share of  and  respectively 
revenues from continuing operations totaled  million in   million in and  million in our net loss included a million charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for goodwill per share and a million loss from discontinued operations per share 
at the beginning of  we implemented statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and determined that million of assets classified as excess of cost over net assets of acquired businesses suffered impairment and had no value 
income loss from continuing operations was million in  million in and million in the net income was increased by million of income tax benefits due to a favorable settlement with a foreign taxing authority 
the net income also included million attributable to an insurance recovery of product claim costs representing million of operating income less million of related income taxes and an million loss from the early retirement of long term debt there were no tax benefits associated with this loss 
during  we recorded a million net charge for the impairment of our blytheville facility representing a million impairment charge to operating income less million allocated to minority interest and million of income tax benefit 
the net loss was reduced by million of income tax benefits for a reduced assessment by a foreign taxing authority and reversals of tax reserves that had been provided in prior years 
other fluctuations to our income loss from continuing operations for through are primarily related to changes in the selling prices of nitrogen products and methanol and changes in the cost of natural gas  our primary raw material 

table of contents factors that affect operating results factors that may affect our operating results include the relative balance of supply and demand for nitrogen fertilizers  industrial nitrogen and methanol  the availability and cost of natural gas  the number of planted acres which is affected by both worldwide demand and government policies  the types of crops planted  the effect of general weather patterns on the timing and duration of field work for crop planting and harvesting  the effect of environmental legislation on supply and demand for our products  the availability of financing sources to fund seasonal working capital needs  and the potential for interruption to operations due to accidents or natural disasters 
the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen products and methanol is natural gas 
natural gas costs in accounted for approximately of our total costs and expenses excluding the plants acquired in the mcc acquisition 
a significant increase in the price of natural gas that is not hedged or recovered through an increase in the price of our nitrogen and methanol products would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results 
a portion of global nitrogen products and methanol production is at facilities with access to fixed price natural gas supplies that have been  and could continue to be  substantially lower priced than natural gas costs at our north american and uk facilities 
our point lisas nitrogen limited facility is located in trinidad with access to such lower cost natural gas 
we enter into forward pricing contracts for some of our natural gas requirements when such arrangements would not result in costs greater than expected north american and uk selling prices for our finished products 
our current natural gas forward pricing policy is to fix or cap the price of between and of our natural gas requirements for a rolling month period and up to of our natural gas requirements for the subsequent month period through supply contracts  financial derivatives and other instruments 
we notify the board of directors when we deviate from the policy 
our december  forward positions covered of our expected natural gas requirements and none beyond excluding the natural gas requirements of point lisas nitrogen limited which purchases its gas under contract with the natural gas company of trinidad and tobago 
prices for nitrogen products are influenced by the world supply and demand balance for ammonia and other nitrogen based products 
long term demand is affected by population growth and rising living standards that determine food consumption 
short term demand is affected by world economic conditions  international trade decisions and grain prices 
supply is affected by increasing worldwide capacity and the availability of nitrogen product exports from major producing regions such as the former soviet union  the middle east and south america 
methanol is used as a raw material in the production of formaldehyde  methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe  acetic acid and numerous other chemical derivatives 
the price of methanol is influenced by the supply and demand for each of these products 
environmental initiatives to ban or reduce the use of mtbe as a fuel additive  such as those currently underway in the united states  will affect demand for methanol 
weather can have a significant effect on demand for our nitrogen products 
weather conditions that delay or intermittently disrupt field work during the planting and growing seasons may cause agricultural customers to use forms of nitrogen fertilizer that are more or less favorable to our sales 
weather conditions following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall 
weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields  which lowers the income of growers and could impair their ability to pay for crop inputs purchased from our dealer customers 

table of contents our nitrogen business segment is seasonal  with the majority of nitrogen products consumed during the second quarter in conjunction with spring planting activity 
due to the business seasonality and the relatively brief periods during which customers consume nitrogen products  our customers and we generally build inventories during the second half of the year in order to ensure product availability during the peak sales season 
for our current level of sales  we require lines of credit to fund inventory increases and to support customer credit terms 
we believe that our credit facilities are adequate for expected sales levels 
our manufacturing operations may be subject to significant interruption if one or more of our facilities were to experience a major accident or were damaged by severe weather or other natural disaster 
we currently maintain insurance  including business interruption insurance  which we believe is sufficient to allow us to cover major damage to any of our facilities 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for reporting purposes 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that reflect significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
our critical accounting policies are described below 
impairment of long lived assets we will record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of these items 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
estimates of future cash flows are subject to significant uncertainties and assumptions 
accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from such estimates 
during  events occurred that necessitated an evaluation of recoverability of assets at our beaumont facility 
at december   the beaumont facility had a carrying value  net of million of deferred revenues  of approximately million 
we estimated the remaining useful life of this facility at years assuming normal investment in maintenance and replacement capital throughout this period 
our estimated cash flows over this period  based on our best estimate of future market and operating conditions at december   exceeded the carrying value of these assets and consequently  no impairment charge was recorded for the beaumont facility 

table of contents these cash flow estimates assume beaumont will remain idle through the term of our contract with methanex and  that once restarted  it will produce at historical rates and selling prices will be adequate to realize historical margins over natural gas 
actual results for the beaumont facility could vary substantially from such estimates 
equity investments terra s investments in companies that are accounted for on the equity method of accounting consist of the following ownership interest in point lisas nitrogen limited  which operates an ammonia production plant in trinidad interest in an ammonia storage joint venture located in houston  texas and interest in a joint venture in oklahoma co partnership  located in verdigris  oklahoma which produces co at terra s plant 
equity investments are carried at original cost adjusted for our proportionate share of the investees income  losses and distributions 
we periodically assess the carrying value of our equity investment and will record a loss on equity investments when management concludes a decline in the fair value of the investment is other than temporary 
pension assets and liabilities pension assets and liabilities are affected by the estimated market value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets and discount rates 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets will affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized 
our pension liabilities were million at december   which was million higher than pension plan assets 
the december  liability was computed based on an average discount rate  which was based on yields for high quality corporate bonds with a maturity approximating the duration of our pension liability 
in addition  the pension liability for our uk pension plan  which includes provisions to adjust benefit payments for general inflation rates  was estimated based on an average annual inflation rate 
declines in comparable bond yields or higher uk inflation rates would increase our pension liability 
our net pension liability  after deduction of plan assets  could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate 
post retirement benefits post retirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by assumptions including the discount rate and expected trends in health care costs 
changes in the discount rate and differences between actual and expected health care costs will affect the recorded amount of post retirement benefits expense ultimately recognized 
accounting for acquisitions on december   we acquired mississippi chemical corporation mcc for a purchase price valued at million consisting of million common shares   series b preferred shares and cash of million  including costs directly related to the acquisition 
the acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting with the purchase price allocated to the net assets acquired based upon their estimated fair market values 
this allocation was based on preliminary estimates and may be revised at a later date 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue is recognized when title to finished product passes to the customer 
revenue is recognized as the net amount to be received after deducting estimated amounts for discounts and trade allowances 
revenue includes amounts paid by customers for shipping and handling 
revenues include gains or losses associated with the settlement of nitrogen derivative contracts 
deferred income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect a differences between financial statement carrying amounts and corresponding tax bases and b temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
deferred tax assets also include the expected benefits of carrying forward our net operating losses 
we regularly review deferred tax assets for recoverability and reduce them if we can not sufficiently determine that they will be realized 
we base this determination on projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
at december   deferred tax assets representing future benefits for our us net operating loss carryforwards totaled million 
since we have not generated us taxable income since  we do not have a basis to conclude that future taxable earnings are likely to be available to utilize benefits associated with loss carryforwards 
accordingly  through december   we have reduced our deferred tax assets for us operations by million 
further  we do not expect to recognize additional us tax benefits for future losses until we realize taxable income or generate additional deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences 
if there is a material change in the effective tax rates or time period when temporary difference become taxable or deductible  we may have to additionally reduce all or a significant portion of our deferred tax assets 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realizable value 
the average cost of inventories is determined by using the first in  first out method 
the nitrogen and methanol industries are characterized by rapid change in both demand and pricing 
rapid declines in demand could result in temporary or permanent curtailment of production  while rapid declines in price could result in a lower cost or market adjustment 
intangible assets intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated period of benefit  ranging from two to fourteen years 
we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists 
all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization 
no impairments of intangible assets have been identified during any of the periods presented 

table of contents derivative and financial instruments terra accounts for derivatives in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of derivatives in the balance sheet and the measurement of these instruments at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in earnings unless the normal purchase or sale exception applies or hedge accounting is elected 
terra enters into derivative instruments including future contracts  swap agreements  and purchased options to cap or fix prices for a portion of natural gas production requirements 
terra uses similar derivative instruments to fix or set floor prices for a portion of its nitrogen sales volumes 
terra has designated  documented and assessed accounting hedge relationships  which mostly resulted in cash flow hedges that require the recording of the derivative assets or liabilities at their fair value on the balance sheet with an offset in other comprehensive income 
amounts are removed from other comprehensive income as the underlying transactions occur and realized gains or losses are recorded 

table of contents results of continuing operations compared with consolidated results we reported net income of million on revenues of  million compared with a net loss of million on revenues of  million 
diluted income loss per share for was compared with for results for and were favorably affected by income tax benefits of million and million  respectively  for reduced assessments by a foreign taxing authority and reversals of tax reserves established in prior years 
the net income also included million attributable to an insurance recovery of product claim costs representing million of operating income less million of related income taxes and a million loss from the early retirement of long term debt primarily related to our redemption of million in second priority senior secured notes due there were no tax benefits associated with this loss 
the net loss included a million net charge for the impairment of our blytheville facility representing million impairment charge to operating income less million allocated to minority interest and million income tax benefit 
we classify our operations into two business segments nitrogen products and methanol 
the nitrogen products segment represents the sale of nitrogen products including that produced at our ammonia manufacturing and upgrading facilities 
the methanol segment represents sales of methanol including that produced at our two methanol manufacturing facilities 
mcc revenues and expense are included from the december  acquisition date and are not material 
total revenues and operating income loss by segment for the years ended december  and follow in thousands revenues nitrogen products methanol other revenues operating income loss nitrogen products impairment of long lived assets nitrogen products methanol other expense net 
table of contents nitrogen products volumes and prices for and follow volumes and prices quantities in thousands of tons sales volumes average unit price sales volumes average unit price ammonia nitrogen solutions urea ammonium nitrate after deducting outbound freight costs nitrogen products revenues increased by million to  million for compared with  million for primarily as the result of higher sales prices 
selling prices were higher as the result of increased demand and lower fertilizer supplies caused by industry wide production curtailments since mid price increases also reflected higher imported product costs as the result of us currency declines relative to other currencies and increased international freight rates 
sales volumes in were lower than those of the previous year due mostly to the blytheville production facility s permanent closure in may nitrogen products operating income  excluding charges for the impairment of long lived assets  increased by million to million for from million for higher selling prices and recovery of product claim costs contributed million and million  respectively  to operating income 
these factors were partly offset by higher natural gas costs and increased expenses 
natural gas costs increased million from as unit costs  net of forward pricing gains and losses  were per million british thermal units mmbtu during compared to mmbtu during as a result of forward price contracts  natural gas costs for the nitrogen products segment were million lower than spot prices 
selling  general and administrative expenses assigned to the nitrogen products business segment totaled million for compared to million for the increase is primarily due to incentive pay accruals based on net income  professional fees associated with sarbanes oxley compliance and changes in the allocation methods of centralized expense centers between the nitrogen products and methanol business segments 
during  million of our selling  general and administrative expenses were allocated to the methanol business segment 
those allocations were discontinued in as a result of contracts transferring the marketing rights for our methanol production to methanex 
impairment of long lived assets during  we recorded a million charge for the impairment of the blytheville facility as we concluded that future market conditions may not justify ongoing investment in the maintenance and replacement capital required to operate the blytheville facility for its established useful life 
the blytheville production capabilities were permanently closed in may 
table of contents methanol methanol revenues were million for the year ended december  approximately of methanol revenues were realized under a contract providing methanex with exclusive rights to all methanol production at our beaumont facility 
that contract was executed in december and requires us to sell the beaumont production to methanex at a price which will generally approximate cash production costs 
in addition  methanex pays us one half of the cash margin attributable to beaumont s production based on realized methanol prices and actual natural gas costs 
other contract related revenues include amounts received at signing that are deferred and recognized over the life of the contract on a straight line basis 
during  we realized million of margin sharing and deferred revenues under the methanex contract 
methanol operating income also includes depreciation charges related to the beaumont facility and earnings realized on methanol sales from our woodward facility 
during  methanol segment revenues were derived from market based sales to third party customers 
operating income was largely a function of revenues over production costs  including natural gas  and operating expenses 
other operating activities net we had million of charges from other operating activities in compared to million in these losses represent charges for amortization of deferred financing costs and legal fees related to general corporate activities not allocable to any particular business segment 
interest expense net net interest expense was million in compared with million in the reduction in interest expense primarily related to higher cash balances and the fourth quarter million redemption of senior notes due in minority interest minority interest represents interest in the earnings of the publicly held common units of terra nitrogen company  lp tnclp 
the minority interest charge of million reflected nitrogen earnings for tnclp  which were included in their entirety in consolidated operating results 
minority interest benefits of million were recorded in as the result of tnclp losses  which included an impairment charge for the blytheville facility 
these amounts are directly related to tnclp losses and earnings 
income taxes terra s income tax benefit was million in and included reductions to tax reserves totaling million for a reduced assessment by a foreign taxing authority 
the benefit was net of a million charge to eliminate tax benefits associated with us losses for reasons discussed more fully under critical accounting policies

table of contents nitrogen products revenues increased by million to  million for compared with million in as the result of higher sales prices  partially offset by lower sales volumes 
sales prices were higher as the result of lower fertilizer supplies caused by increased demand and industry wide production curtailments 
sales volumes in were lower than the previous year due to our own production curtailments including a decision to suspend production during the third quarter at the blytheville facility because of high natural gas costs and the seasonal decline in nitrogen fertilizer demand and prices 
higher selling prices contributed million to results and were only partially offset by higher natural gas costs 
natural gas costs increased million from as unit costs  net of forward pricing gains and losses  were per million british thermal units mmbtu during compared to mmbtu during as a result of forward price contracts  natural gas costs for the nitrogen products segment were million higher than spot prices 
impairment of long lived assets on june   we suspended production at our blytheville facility due to expectations that the facility would not cover its cash costs because of continuing high natural gas costs and the seasonal decline in nitrogen fertilizer demand and prices 
in response to this action  and as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the disposal of long lived assets  a million charge was recorded during the second quarter as discussed more fully above 
methanol methanol revenues were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
sales prices increased from gallon in to gallon in  but sales volumes declined from to million gallons 
the sales decline was due  in part  to production outages related to a scheduled plant turnaround 
the methanol segment generated million operating income in compared to million operating income in the lower operating income reflects increased costs and lower volumes  only partially offset by higher prices 
the major cost increase was to natural gas costs which  net of million of cost increases from forward pricing contracts  were mmbtu for compared to mmbtu for other operating activities net we had million of charges from other operating activities in compared to million in these losses represent charges for amortization of deferred financing costs and legal fees related to general corporate activities not allocable to any particular business segment 
the increased loss from was primarily due to amortization of financing costs on the refinancing of senior notes due in 
table of contents interest expense net net interest expense was million in compared with million in the increased interest expense primarily related to higher interest rates paid on the refinancing of senior notes due in minority interest minority interest benefits of million were recorded in as the result of tnclp losses  which included an impairment charge for the blytheville facility  that were included in their entirety in consolidated operating results 
the minority interest charge of million reflected nitrogen earnings for tnclp  which were included in their entirety in consolidated operating results 
these amounts are directly related to tnclp losses and earnings 
income taxes income tax benefits were recorded at an effective rate of for compared with for the benefit includes reductions to tax reserves totaling million for a reduced assessment by a foreign taxing authority and reversal of tax reserves provided in prior years 
these benefits were offset by million of income tax provisions that reduced our deferred tax assets to equal net deferred tax liabilities for reasons discussed more fully above under critical accounting policies 
liquidity and capital resources our primary uses of funds are to fund our working capital requirements  make payments on our debt and other obligations and make payments for plant turnarounds and capital expenditures 
the principle sources of funds will be cash flow from operations and borrowings under available bank facilities 
during  cash and short term investments increased million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million 
cash provided from financing activities was million  primarily for the million issuance of series a perpetual preferred shares less the redemption of million of senior notes due in cash used for investing activities was million  primarily for acquisition of mississippi chemical corporation mcc as well as capital expenditures and plant turnaround costs 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  composed of million of cash provided from operating activities and million provided by lower net working capital balances 
net working capital balances declined primarily due to an increase in customer prepayments as the result of higher prices and demand for such arrangements 
we had million in customer prepayments at december  for the selling price and delivery costs of nitrogen products that we will deliver during the first half 
on december   we acquired the outstanding common stock of mcc for a combination of our common shares  series b preferred shares and cash totaling million 
in addition  we assumed million of mcc s existing debt obligations  million of unfunded pension liabilities and net deferred tax liabilities of million 
the series b preferred shares have a liquidation value of million and we have the option to redeem the series b shares for million common shares at any time before october  if the series b preferred shares are not redeemed  the shares will earn a cumulative 
table of contents dividend equal to plus the october  yield on our second priority senior secured notes due the mcc debt obligations were amended to extend their maturity to december  and are repayable at of par 
the mcc debt obligations bear cash interest at the higher of a floating base rate plus and 
we also provided the debt holders five year warrants to purchase million of our common shares at per share  which were valued at million at mcc closing 
the mcc debt obligations  which are secured by certain mcc assets  also require that we adhere to certain limitations on additional debt  capital expenditures  acquisitions  liens  asset sales  investments  prepayments of subordinated indebtedness  changes in lines of business and transactions with affiliates 
on february   we announced plans to prepay million of the mcc debt obligations on march  during the fourth quarter  we issued cumulative convertible perpetual series a preferred shares with a liquidation value of million for net proceeds of million 
the series a preferred shares are not redeemable by us  are convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of per common share at the option of the holder and may at our option be automatically converted to common shares after december  if the closing price for our common shares exceeds of the conversion price for any twenty days within a consecutive thirty day period prior to such conversion 
upon the occurrence of a fundamental change to our capital structure  including a change of control  merger  or sale of the company  holders of the series a preferred shares may require us to purchase any or all of their shares at a price equal to their liquidation value plus any accumulated  but unpaid  dividends 
we also have the right  under certain conditions  to require holders of the series a preferred shares to exchange their shares for convertible subordinated debentures with similar terms 
on november   we redeemed million second priority senior secured notes due for million  including redemption premiums 
during and  we funded plant and equipment purchases of million and million  respectively  primarily for replacement or stay in business capital needs 
we expect plant and equipment purchases to approximate million consisting primarily of expenditures for replacement of equipment at manufacturing facilities 
plant turnaround costs represent cash used for the periodic scheduled major maintenance of our continuous process production facilities that is performed at each plant generally every two years 
we funded million and million of plant turnaround costs in and we estimate plant turnaround costs will approximate million 
on december   we entered into revolving credit facilities totaling million that expire in june borrowing availability under the credit facility is generally based on eligible cash balances  of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventory  less outstanding letters of credit 
these facilities include million only available for the use of tnclp  one of our consolidated subsidiaries 
at december   borrowing availabilities exceeded the credit facilities million maximum 
there were no outstanding revolving credit borrowings and there were million in outstanding letters of credit  resulting in remaining borrowing availability of approximately million under the facilities 
we are required to maintain a combined minimum unused borrowing availability of million 
the credit facility also requires that we adhere to certain limitations on 
table of contents additional debt  capital expenditures  acquisitions  liens  asset sales  investments  prepayments of subordinated indebtedness  changes in lines of business and transactions with affiliates 
in addition  if our borrowing availability falls below a combined million  we are required to have generated million of operating cash flows  or earnings before interest income taxes  depreciation  amortization and other non cash items as defined in the credit facility for the preceding four quarters 
our ability to meet credit facility covenants will depend on future operating cash flows  working capital needs  receipt of customer prepayments and trade credit terms 
failure to meet these covenants could result in additional costs and fees to amend the credit facility or could result in termination of the facility 
access to adequate bank facilities is critical to funding our operating cash needs 
based on our december  financial position and current market conditions for our finished products and natural gas  we anticipate that we will be able to meet our covenants through our ability to manage our exposure to commodity price risk in the purchase of natural gas through the use of financial derivatives may be affected by limitations imposed by our bank agreement covenants 
contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments were as follows at december  payments due in in millions less than one year one to three years three to five years thereafter long term debt operating leases capital lease obligations interest expense on fixed rate debt ammonia purchase contract other purchase obligations total we have a contractual obligation to purchase one half of the ammonia produced by point lisas nitrogen limited  our joint venture ammonia plant located in trinidad 
the purchase price is based on the average market price of ammonia  fob caribbean  less a discount 
obligations in the above table are based on purchasing  short tons per year at the december average price paid 
this contract expires in october our pension liabilities were million at december   which was million higher than our pension plan assets 
the pension liability was computed based on a discount rate  which was based on yields for high quality corporate bonds moody s investor service aa rated or equivalent with a maturity approximating the duration of our pension liability 
future declines in comparable bond yields would increase our pension liability and future increases in bond yields would decrease our pension liability 
our pension liability net of plan assets could increase or decrease depending on the extent that returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate 
in addition  the pension liability for our uk pension plan  which includes provisions to adjust benefit payments for general inflation rates  was estimated based on a inflation rate 
our pension liability could increase or decrease based on actual uk inflation rates 
our cash contributions to pension plans were million in and are 
table of contents estimated at million in and actual contributions could vary from these estimates depending on actual returns for plan assets  legislative changes to pension funding requirements and or plan amendments 
expenditures related to environmental  health and safety regulation compliance are primarily composed of operating costs that totaled million in because environmental  health and safety regulations are expected to continue to change and generally to be more restrictive than current requirements  the costs of compliance will likely increase 
we do not expect compliance with such regulations will have a material adverse effect on the results of operations  financial position or net cash flows 
we incurred million of capital expenditures to ensure compliance with environmental  health and safety regulations 
we may be required to install additional air and water quality control equipment  such as low nitrous oxide burners  scrubbers  ammonia sensors and continuous emission monitors to continue to achieve compliance with the clean air act and similar requirements 
these equipment requirements typically apply to competitors as well 
we estimate that the cost of complying with these existing requirements in and beyond will be less than million  including the plants acquired in the mcc acquisition 
we own of the common units of tnclp which  in accordance with the partnership agreement  permits us to call all common units that we do not own 
during  and  we distributed million  million and million  respectively  to the minority tnclp common unitholders 
in addition  million of distributions are payable to the minority tnclp common unitholders on february  tnclp distributions are based on available cash as defined in the partnership agreement 
cash balances at december  were million  all of which is unrestricted

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management and financial instruments market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage risk in the areas of a foreign currency fluctuations  b changes in natural gas prices and c changes in nitrogen prices and d changes in interest rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the use of derivative financial instruments 
our policy is to avoid unnecessary risk and to limit  to the extent practical  risks associated with operating activities 
our management may not engage in activities that expose terra to speculative or non operating risks and is expected to limit risks to acceptable levels 
the use of derivative financial instruments is consistent with our overall business objectives 
derivatives are used to manage operating risk within the limits established by our board of directors  and in response to identified exposures  provided they qualify as hedge activities 
as such  derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations  to hedge specific assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency  to hedge firm commitments and forecasted natural gas purchase transactions  to set a floor for nitrogen selling prices and to protect against foreign exchange rate movements between different currencies that impact revenue and earnings expressed in us dollars 
the use of derivative financial instruments subjects terra to some inherent risks associated with future contractual commitments  including market and operational risks  credit risk associated with counterparties  product location basis differentials and market liquidity 
terra continuously monitors the valuation of identified risks and adjusts the portfolio based on current market conditions 
foreign currency fluctuations our policy is to manage risk associated with foreign currency fluctuations by entering into forward exchange and option contracts covering specific currency obligations or net foreign currency operating requirements  as appropriate 
such hedging is limited to the amounts and duration of the specific obligations being hedged and  in the case of operating requirements  no more than of the forecasted requirements 
the primary currencies to which we are exposed are the canadian dollar and the british pound 
at december   we had nominal forward currency positions that were matched with committed capital expenditures 
natural gas prices north american operations natural gas is the principal raw material used to manufacture nitrogen and methanol 
natural gas prices are volatile and we mitigate some of this volatility through the use of derivative commodity instruments 
our current policy is to hedge of our natural gas requirements for the upcoming months and up to of requirements for the following month period  provided that such arrangements would not result in costs greater than expected selling prices for our finished products 
we notify the board of directors when we deviate from this policy 
annual north american natural gas requirements are approximately million mmbtu 
we have hedged of our expected north american requirements and none of our requirements beyond december  the fair value of these 
table of contents instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices from brokers  realized gains or losses and our computations 
these instruments and other natural gas positions fixed natural gas prices at million more than published prices for december  forward markets 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in price 
as of december  our market risk exposure related to future natural gas requirements being hedged was million based on a sensitivity analysis 
changes in the market value of these derivative instruments have a high correlation to changes in the spot price of natural gas 
since we forward price only a portion of our natural gas requirements  this hypothetical adverse impact on natural gas derivative instruments would be more than offset by lower costs for all natural gas we purchase 
natural gas prices trinidad operation the natural gas requirements of point lisas nitrogen limited  an ammonia production joint venture in which terra has a interest  are supplied under contract with the natural gas company of trinidad and tobago 
the cost of natural gas to the joint venture fluctuates based on changes in the market price of ammonia 
natural gas prices united kingdom operations to meet natural gas production requirements at our united kingdom production facilities  we generally enter into one or two year gas supply contracts and fix prices for of total volume requirements 
annual procurement requirements for uk natural gas are approximately million mmbtu 
as of december   we had fixed price contracts for of our expected uk natural gas requirements and none of our natural gas requirements 
our uk fixed price contracts for natural gas purchases were at prices million higher than published prices for december  forward markets 
we do not use derivative commodity instruments for our united kingdom natural gas needs 
nitrogen prices the prices for nitrogen products can be volatile and we mitigate some of this volatility through the use of derivative commodity instruments 
our current policy is to hedge no more than of our expected production for the upcoming months and no more than of any single month s expected production 
we notify the board of directors when we exceed this policy 
we have hedged less than of our expected north american sales of nitrogen solutions 
the fair value of these instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices from brokers  realized gains or losses and our computations 
these instruments fixed nitrogen solution prices at million less than published prices for december  forward markets
