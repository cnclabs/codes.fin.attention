critical accounting policies 
the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates based on historical experience  current market conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
nevertheless  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following is a summary of the company s most critical accounting policies  which are defined as those policies whereby judgments or uncertainties could affect the application of those policies and materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
for a summary of all of the company s significant accounting policies  see note i summary of significant accounting policies 
effects of regulation the company is subject to regulation by certain state and federal authorities 
the company  in its distribution segment  has accounting policies which conform to the fasb standard  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  and which are in accordance with the accounting requirements and ratemaking practices of the regulatory authorities 
the application of these accounting policies allows the company to defer expenses and revenues on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that those expenses and income will be allowed in the ratemaking process in a period different from the period in which they would have been reflected in the income statement by an unregulated company 
these deferred assets and liabilities are then flowed through the results of operations in the period in which the same amounts are included in rates and recovered from or refunded to customers 
management s assessment of the probability of recovery or pass through of regulatory assets and liabilities requires judgment and interpretation of laws and regulatory commission orders 
if  for any reason  the company ceases to meet the criteria for application of regulatory accounting treatment for all or part of its operations  the regulatory assets and liabilities related to those portions ceasing to meet such criteria would be eliminated from the consolidated balance sheet and included in the consolidated statement of operations for the period in which the discontinuance of regulatory accounting treatment occurs 
the aggregate amount of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected in the consolidated balance sheets are  and  at december   and  and  at june  and  and  at june   respectively 
long lived assets long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangibles comprise a significant amount of the company s total assets 
the company makes judgments and estimates about the carrying value of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation methods and useful lives 
the company also reviews these assets for impairment on a periodic basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of an asset s fair value with its carrying value  if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in an amount equal to that excess 
management s determination of an asset s fair value requires it to make long term forecasts of future revenues and costs related to the asset  when the asset s fair value is not readily apparent from other sources 
these forecasts require assumptions about future demand  future market conditions and regulatory developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
during june  the company evaluated goodwill for impairment 
the determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows attributable to the company s reporting units that have goodwill  as compared to the carrying value of those reporting units net assets 
as of june   and december  pursuant to the fasb standard  goodwill and other intangible assets  no impairment had been indicated 
in connection with the company s cash flow improvement plan announced in july  the company began the divestiture of certain non core assets 
as a result of prices of comparable businesses for various non core properties and pursuant to the fasb standard  impairment of long lived assets and assets to be disposed of  a goodwill impairment loss of  was recognized in depreciation and amortization on the consolidated statement of operations for the quarter ended september  investments in securities at december   the company owned common and preferred stock in non public companies whose value is not readily determinable 
these investments were accounted for under the cost method 
a judgmental aspect of accounting for these securities involves determining whether an other than temporary decline in value has been sustained 
management reviews these securities on a quarterly basis to determine whether a decline in value is other than temporary 
factors that are considered in assessing whether a decline in value is other than temporary include  but are not limited to earnings trends and asset quality  near term prospects and financial condition of the issuer  financial condition and prospects of the issuer s region and industry  and southern union s intent and ability to retain the investment 
if management determines that a decline in value is other than temporary  a charge will be recorded on the consolidated statement of operations to reduce the carrying value of the investment security to its estimated fair value 
in december  the company recorded a total non cash charge of  to recognize an other than temporary impairment of the carrying value of its investment in advent 
this impairment was comprised of a write down of  and  to the company s investment and convertible notes receivable accounts  respectively 
the company reevaluated the fair value of its investment in advent as a result of advent s recent efforts to raise additional capital from private investors  which placed a significantly lower valuation on advent than reflected in the carrying value of the company s investment in advent 
the foregoing  as well as certain other factors  led to the non cash charge discussed above 
after the non cash write down  the company s remaining investment in advent as of december   is  this remaining investment may be subject to future market risk 
additionally  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company has guaranteed a  line of credit between advent and a bank 
advent remains current and is not in default in this line of credit 
in september and june  southern union determined that declines in the value of its investment in pointserve were other than temporary 
accordingly  the company recorded non cash charges of  and  during the quarters ended september  and june   respectively  to reduce the carrying value of this investment to its estimated fair value 
the company recognized these valuation adjustments to reflect significant lower private equity valuation metrics and changes in the business outlook of pointserve 
pointserve is a closely held  privately owned company and  as such  has no published market value 
the company s remaining investment of  at december  may be subject to future market value risk 
the company will continue to monitor the value of its investment and periodically assess the impact  if any  on reported earnings in future periods 
pensions and other postretirement benefits the company follows the fasb standards employers accounting for pensions and employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions to account for pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs  respectively 
these statements require liabilities to be recorded on the balance sheet at the present value of these future obligations to employees net of any plan assets 
the calculation of these liabilities and associated expenses require the expertise of actuaries and are subject to many assumptions including life expectancies  present value discount rates  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase and anticipated health care costs 
any change in these assumptions can significantly change the liability and associated expenses recognized in any given year 
however  the company expects to recover substantially all of its net periodic pension and other post retirement benefit costs attributable to employees in its distribution segment in accordance with the applicable regulatory commission authorization 
for financial reporting purposes  the difference between the amounts of pension cost and post retirement benefit cost recoverable in rates and the amounts of such costs as determined under applicable accounting principles is recorded as either a regulatory asset or liability  as appropriate 
derivatives and hedging activities the company follows the fasb standard  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  to account for derivative and hedging activities 
in accordance with this statement all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value 
on the date the derivative contract is entered into  the company designates the derivative as either i a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment fair value hedge  ii a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid in conjunction with a recognized asset or liability cash flow hedge  or iii an instrument that is held for trading or non hedging purposes a trading or non hedging instrument 
for derivatives treated as a fair value hedge  the effective portion of changes in fair value are recorded as an adjustment to the hedged debt 
the ineffective portion of a fair value hedge is recognized in earnings if the short cut method of assessing effectiveness is not used 
upon termination of a fair value hedge of a debt instrument  the resulting gain or loss is amortized to income through the maturity date of the debt instrument 
for derivatives treated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of changes in fair value is recorded in other comprehensive income until the related hedge items impact earnings 
any ineffective portion of a cash flow hedge is reported in earnings immediately 
for derivatives treated as trading or non hedging instruments  changes in fair value are reported in current period earnings 
fair value is determined based upon mathematical models using current and historical data 
the company formally assesses  both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods 
the company discontinues hedge accounting when i it determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item  ii the derivative expires or is sold  terminated  or exercised  iii it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur  or iv management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate 
in all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding  the company will carry the derivative at its fair value on the balance sheet  recognizing changes in the fair value in current period earnings 
see note xi derivative instruments and hedging activities 
commitments and contingencies the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to environmental and other matters 
accounting for contingencies requires significant judgments by management regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to potential liability 
for further discussion of the company s commitments and contingencies  see note xviii commitments and contingencies 
purchase accounting the company s acquisition of panhandle energy was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the fasb standard  business combinations 
cce holdings  a joint venture in which southern union owns a equity interest  also applied the purchase method of accounting for its acquisition of crosscountry energy on november  under this statement  the purchase price paid by the acquirer  including transaction costs  is allocated to the net assets acquired as of the acquisition date based on their fair value 
determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
southern union has generally used outside appraisers to assist in the determination of fair value 
the appraisals related to southern union s acquisition of panhandle energy were finalized in the outside appraisals to be completed for cce holdings purchase of crosscountry energy are to be completed in accordingly  any changes in the preliminary allocations of fair value due to the completion of the appraisals will be reflected through the company s investment in  and the equity earnings from  cce holdings at the time such changes are known 
accounting pronouncements in accordance with fasb financial staff position fsp  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  the medicare prescription drug act the benefit obligation and net periodic post retirement cost in the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes do not reflect the effects of the medicare prescription drug act on the company s post retirement healthcare plan because the company is unable to conclude whether benefits provided by the plan are actuarially equivalent to medicare part d under the medicare prescription drug act 
the method of determining whether a sponsor s plan will qualify for actuarial equivalency was published january  by the center for medicare and medical services 
once the determination of actuarial equivalence for current and future years is complete  if eligible  the company will account for the subsidy as an actuarial gain  pursuant to the guidelines of this standard 
in december  the fasb issued r  share based payment revised 
the statement revises fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  supersedes the accounting principal board opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
the statement will be effective for the company in the first interim reporting period beginning after june  and will require the company to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in its consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the adoption of the statement will require additional accounting and disclosure related to the income tax and cash flow effects resulting from share based payment arrangements 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of this statement on its consolidated financial statements 
on october   the american jobs creation act of the act was signed 
the act raises a number of issues with respect to accounting for income taxes 
on december   the fasb issued a staff position regarding the accounting implications of the act related to the deduction for qualified domestic production activities fsp fas which is effective for periods subsequent to december  the guidance in the fsp otherwise applies to financial statements for periods ending after the date the act was enacted 
in fsp fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of  the fasb decided that the deduction for qualified domestic production activities should be accounted for as a special deduction under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  and rejected an alternative view to treat it as a rate reduction 
accordingly  any benefit from the deduction should be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on the tax return 
in most cases  a company s existing deferred tax balances will not be impacted at the date of enactment 
for some companies  the deduction could have an impact on their effective tax rate and  therefore  should be considered when determining the estimated annual rate used for interim financial reporting 
the company is currently evaluating the impact  if any  of this fsp on its consolidated financial statements 
in november  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc issued an industry wide proposed accounting release that  if enacted as written  would require pipeline companies to expense rather than capitalize certain costs related to mandated pipeline integrity programs 
the accounting release is proposed to be effective january following a period of public comment on the release 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of this release on its consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has long term debt and revolving credit facilities  which subject the company to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
at december   the company had issued fixed rate long term debt aggregating  in principal amount excluding premiums on panhandle energy s debt of  and having a fair value of  these instruments are fixed rate and  therefore  do not expose the company to the risk of earnings loss due to changes in market interest rates 
however  the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately  if interest rates were to decline by from their levels at december  in general  such an increase in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if the company were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments in the open market prior to their maturity 
the company s floating rate obligations aggregated  at december  and primarily consisted of the bridge loan  the  panhandle notes that were swapped to a floating rate  the term note  the debt assumed under the panhandle acquisition related to the trunkline lng facility  and amounts borrowed under the long term facility 
the floating rate obligations under these agreements expose the company to the risk of increased interest expense in the event of increases in short term interest rates 
if the floating rates were to increase by from december  levels  the company s consolidated interest expense would increase by a total of approximately  each month in which such increase continued 
the risk of an economic loss is reduced at this time as a result of the company s regulated status with respect to its distribution segment operations 
any unrealized gains or losses are accounted for in accordance with the fasb standard  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  as a regulatory asset or liability 
the change in exposure to loss in earnings and cash flow related to interest rate risk from june  to december  is not material to the company 
see note xiii debt and capital lease 
in connection with the acquisition of the pennsylvania operations  the company assumed a guaranty with a bank whereby the company unconditionally guaranteed payment of financing obtained for the development of pei power park 
in march  the borough of archbald  the county of lackawanna  and the valley view school district together the taxing authorities approved a tax incremental financing plan tif plan for the development of pei power park 
the tif plan requires that i the redevelopment authority of lackawanna county raise  of funds to be used for infrastructure improvements of the pei power park  ii the taxing authorities create a tax increment district and use the incremental tax revenues generated from new development to service the  debt  and iii pei power corporation  a subsidiary of the company  guarantee the debt service payments 
in may  the redevelopment authority of lackawanna county borrowed  from a bank under a promissory note tif debt  which was refinanced and modified in may beginning may  the tif debt bears interest at a variable rate equal to three quarters percent 
lower than the national prime rate of interest with no interest rate floor or ceiling 
the tif debt matures on june  interest only payments were required until june   and semi annual interest and principal payments are required thereafter 
as of december   the interest rate on the tif debt was and estimated incremental tax revenues are expected to cover approximately of the annual debt service 
based on information available at this time  the company believes that the amount provided for the potential shortfall in estimated future incremental tax revenues is adequate as of december  the balance outstanding on the tif debt was  as of december  the company is party to interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of  as of december  that fix the interest rate applicable to floating rate long term debt and which qualify for hedge accounting 
for the six months ended december   the amount of swap ineffectiveness was not significant 
as of december   floating rate libor based interest payments are exchanged for weighted average fixed rate interest payments of  which does not include the spread on the underlying variable debt rate of 
as such  payments or receipts on interest rate swap agreements  in excess of the liability recorded  are recognized as adjustments to interest expense 
as of december   june  and june   the fair value liability position of the swaps was   and  respectively 
as of december   approximately  of net after tax gains included in accumulated other comprehensive income related to these swaps is expected to be reclassified to interest expense during the next twelve months as the hedged interest payments occur 
current market pricing models were used to estimate fair values of interest rate swap agreements 
the company was also party to an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of  at june  that fixed the interest rate applicable to floating rate long term debt and which qualified for hedge accounting 
the fair value liability position of the swap was  at june  in october  the swap expired and  of unrealized after tax losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income relating to this swap was reclassified to interest expense during the quarter ended december  in march and april  the company entered into a series of treasury rate locks with an aggregate notional amount of  to manage its exposure against changes in future interest payments attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate prior to the anticipated issuance of fixed rate debt 
these treasury rate locks expired on june   resulting in a  after tax loss that was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized into interest expense over the lives of the associated debt instruments 
as of december   approximately  of net after tax losses in accumulated other comprehensive income will be amortized into interest expense during the next twelve months 
the notional amounts of the interest rate swaps are not exchanged and do not represent exposure to credit loss 
in the event of default by a counterparty  the risk in these transactions is the cost of replacing the agreements at current market rates 
in march  panhandle energy entered into interest rate swaps to hedge the risk associated with the fair value of its  senior notes 
these swaps are designated as fair value hedges and qualify for the short cut method under fasb standard  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
under the swap agreements  panhandle energy will receive fixed interest payments at a rate of and will make floating interest payments based on the six month libor 
no ineffectiveness is assumed in the hedging relationship between the debt instrument and the interest rate swap 
as of december  and june   the fair values of the swaps are included in the consolidated balance sheet as liabilities and matching adjustments to the underlying debt of  and  respectively 
during the year ended june   the company acquired natural gas commodity swap derivatives and collar transactions in order to mitigate price volatility of natural gas passed through to utility customers 
the cost of the derivative products and the settlement of the respective obligations are recorded through the gas purchase adjustment clause as authorized by the applicable regulatory authority and therefore do not impact earnings 
the fair value of the contracts is recorded as an adjustment to a regulatory asset liability in the consolidated balance sheet 
as of december  and june   the fair values of the contracts  which expire at various times through march  are included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets and matching adjustments to deferred cost of gas of  and  respectively

all unauthorized trading activity was subsequently closed in march and april of resulting in a cumulative cash expense of  net of taxes  and deferred income of  at june  for the six months ended december   and the years ended june   and  the company recorded    and  respectively  through other income relating to the expiration of contracts resulting from this trading activity 
the remaining deferred liability of  at december  related to these derivative instruments will be recognized as income in the consolidated statement of operations over the next year based on the related contracts 
the company established new limitations on trading activities  as well as new compliance controls and procedures that are intended to make it easier to identify quickly any unauthorized trading activities
