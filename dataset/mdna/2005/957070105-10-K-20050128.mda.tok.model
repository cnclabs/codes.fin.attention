item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion is intended to assist in the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the results of operations and financial condition of westaff  inc  together with its consolidated subsidiaries

except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed should be considered forward looking statements and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on those statements 
the forward looking statements in this discussion are made based on information available as of the date hereof and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s actual results and financial position to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements and to be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  those discussed in item factors affecting future operating results 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events  except as required by applicable laws and regulations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the amounts and disclosures reported within those financial statements 
these estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis by management and generally affect revenue recognition  collectibility of accounts receivable  workers compensation costs  impairment of goodwill  income taxes  including the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  and contingencies and litigation 
management s estimates and assumptions are based on historical experiences and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results under circumstances and conditions different than those assumed could result in differences from the estimated amounts in the financial statements 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies are those most significantly affected by management s assumptions or the use of estimates  and are important to the understanding of its business operations and results from operations 
revenue recognition 
the company accounts for revenue and the related direct costs in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
 reporting revenue gross versus net as an agent 
revenue generated by franchise agents and related costs of services are included as part of the company s consolidated revenue and costs of services  respectively  since the company has the direct contractual relationships with the customers  holds title to the related customer receivables and is the legal employer of the temporary employees 
franchise agents sales represented  and of the company s revenue for fiscal  and  respectively 
the company also has a licensing program in which the licensee has the direct contractual relationships with the customers  holds title to the related customer receivables and is the legal employer of the temporary employees 
accordingly  sales and costs of services generated by the license operation are not included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
fees are paid to the company based either on a percentage of sales or of gross profit generated by the licensee and such license fees are recorded by the company as license fees and included in revenue 
as of october   the company had only one remaining licensee and is no longer offering license agreements to new prospects 
collectibility of accounts receivable 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts on its accounts receivable balances for estimated losses projected to result from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
these allowances  which are million each at october  and november   are largely determined based on customers financial conditions  the company s historical experiences  interactions with customers and industry trends 
if the financial condition of these customers were to deteriorate to the point it would impair their ability to make the required payments  additional allowances may be required  which could materially adversely affect the financial condition of the company 
workers compensation costs 
the company self insures the deductible amount related to workers compensation claims  which was  per claim for policy year and  per claim for policy year  and maintains accruals for these obligations 
these accruals amounted to million and million at october  and november   respectively 
the company accrues the estimated costs of these claims based upon the expected loss rates incurred within the various temporary employment categories provided by the company 
at least annually  the company obtains an independent actuarially determined calculation of the estimated costs of claims actually made to date  as well as claims incurred but not yet reported 
the resulting calculation is partially based on the company s historical loss development trends as well as overall industry trends 
as a result of updates in the actuary s valuation  revisions may be made to recorded liabilities 
whereas management believes the recorded liabilities are adequate  there are inherent limitations in the estimation process whereby future actual loss rates may exceed projected loss rates  which could materially adversely affect the financial condition of the company 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
effective november   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized but instead be evaluated for impairment by applying a fair value based test at least annually or if events or circumstances change that may indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its book value 
intangible assets with finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the company utilizes an independent third party valuation firm to determine the fair value of its individual reporting units 
the valuation methodologies considered include analyses of discounted cash flows at the reporting unit level  publicly traded companies multiples within the temporary staffing industry and historical control premiums paid by acquirers purchasing companies similar to westaff 
as a result of the initial impairment tests upon adoption of sfas no 
 the company recorded a non cash charge of million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in its australia operations 
this charge is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended november  the company performs its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
income taxes 
the company records income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
a valuation allowance is established when management determines it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset is not realizable in the foreseeable future 
at october   substantially all of the company s net deferred tax assets were offset with a valuation allowance of million and at november   of the company s net deferred tax assets were offset with a valuation allowance of million 
the allowances were recorded because the company assessed it unlikely that these deferred taxes would be realized in future years 
if  in future assessments of the realizability of the deferred tax assets  the company determines that a reduction in the allowance is required  both the valuation allowance and income tax expense would be reduced in the period of such determination 
contingencies and litigation 
in the ordinary course of its business  the company is periodically threatened with or named as a defendant in various lawsuits  claims and pending actions 
the principal risks that the company insures against are workers compensation  general liability  automobile liability  property damage  alternative staffing errors and omissions  fiduciary liability and fidelity losses 
if a potential loss arising from these lawsuits  claims and actions is probable and reasonably estimable  the company records the estimated liability based on circumstances and assumptions existing at the time 
whereas management believes the recorded liabilities are adequate  there are inherent limitations in the estimation process whereby future actual losses may exceed projected losses  which could materially adversely affect the financial condition of the company 
executive overview fiscal marks the company s highest revenue since fiscal  both for the fourth fiscal quarter and for the fiscal year 
the company is also very pleased to report a return to profitability during fiscal  with annual earnings per share of and fourth quarter earnings per share of 
domestic revenue grew steadily quarter over quarter during the year to conclude at a annual increase over fiscal international revenue increased for the year  aided by favorable currency exchange rates 
on a constant currency basis  international revenue increased 
as the company has been reporting  in recent years gross margins for the staffing industry have been negatively impacted by higher workers compensation and state unemployment costs  as well as continued competitive pricing pressures 
the company is encouraged  however  by the increased demand for temporary staffing services throughout fiscal this  and the company s continued focus on growing direct hire revenue  leads the company to believe that the margin erosion is slowing and a turn around in margins may be forthcoming in the foreseeable future  but there can be no assurances that this will occur 
the company closed fiscal with an improved financial position and ample borrowing capacity to meet expected working capital requirements for fiscal the company s strong operating performance enabled it to negotiate amendments to its credit facilities that considerably increased its borrowing capacity 
the company was also able to successfully negotiate with its insurance carrier the return of million in cash that was being held as collateral for its workers compensation obligations in exchange for million in letters of credit 
in addition  the company was able to reduce its outstanding surety bond from million to million  and anticipates elimination of the surety bond completely in the third fiscal quarter of the company believes it is well positioned  both strategically and financially  to take advantage of a more stable and growing economy as it moves into fiscal discontinued operations during fiscal  the company discontinued its medical business western medical principally through a sale to intrepid usa under the terms of the sale  the company retained the majority of accounts receivable  including trade and medicare accounts receivable balances 
prior to fiscal  the company appealed western medical s medicare cost report settlement 
during the first quarter of fiscal  as a result of the favorable appeal settlement  the company recognized  of income from discontinued operations 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company resolved certain significant legal and liability claims and evaluated future risks associated with remaining pending claims 
as a result   of income from discontinued operations was recorded for the fiscal year ended october  results of continuing operations the table below sets forth  for the three most recent fiscal years  certain results of continuing operations data as a percentage of revenues 
fiscal year revenue costs of services gross profit franchise agents share of gross profit selling and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization arbitration expenses restructuring charges operating income loss from continuing operations interest expense interest income income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income tax provision benefit income loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle less than fiscal compared to fiscal revenue increased million or for fiscal  as compared to fiscal domestic revenue increased  while international revenue  before discounting the effects of favorable exchange rates  increased over fiscal the domestic revenue increase is the result of an increase in billed hours of coupled with a modest increase in average bill rates of 
the growth in domestic billed hours reflects new business as well as increases in volume with various existing customers 
excluding the effect of exchange rate fluctuations  international revenue increased  with an increase of in billed hours and  on a constant currency basis  an increase in average bill rates of 
fiscal consecutive quarterly revenue increases for the company were   and  respectively  for the first  second  third and fourth quarters as compared to fiscal for the first two four week accounting periods in fiscal  consolidated revenue for the company increased as compared to the same periods in fiscal based on the company s view of industry trends as well as recent trends in temporary staffing as reported by the bureau of labor statistics  the company expects these revenue increases to moderate during fiscal costs of services include hourly wages of temporary employees  employer payroll taxes  state unemployment and workers compensation insurance and other employee related costs 
costs of services increased million  or  in fiscal  as compared to fiscal gross margin declined from for fiscal to for fiscal the margin decline reflects the industry wide strain on domestic margins due to competitive pressures and higher relative state unemployment and workers compensation costs 
as a percent of direct labor  domestic state unemployment rates increased percentage points and domestic workers compensation rates increased percentage points over the fiscal rates 
international gross margins increased from for fiscal to for fiscal  with margin improvements in australia  norway and the united kingdom driven largely by increases in direct hire fees 
it is currently anticipated that gross margins will remain relatively flat  or increase slightly  in fiscal as a result of higher direct hire fees and increases in bill rates relative to costs partially offset by expected increases in domestic state unemployment insurance rates and increased workers compensation costs 
the company s workers compensation costs tend to vary depending upon the mix of business between clerical administrative and light industrial staffing 
unexpected adverse development of open claims and increases in the company s incurred but not reported ibnr claims can also significantly affect the level of accruals needed to cover workers compensation costs 
the company reviews interim and annual actuarial estimates and monitors claim activity to ensure that accruals remain appropriate in light of loss trends 
however  unanticipated adverse loss development trends can result in a need for additional charges to be recorded 
based on the results of its annual actuarial valuation  the company recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal to increase its domestic workers compensation reserves 
the fourth quarter of fiscal included a similar charge of million 
approximately million of the fiscal charge related to adverse loss development for policy years prior to  with approximately million of that amount relating to policy years and earlier 
the company aggressively works to close out claims associated with these earlier years  however  many older claims remain problematic 
accordingly  the company strengthened its overall workers compensation reserves to take into account these negative historical trends 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s efforts to control workers compensation costs will be effective or that loss development trends will not require additional increases in workers compensation accruals in future periods 
franchise agents share of gross profit represents the net distribution paid to franchise agents based either on a percentage of the sales or gross profit generated by the franchise agents operations 
as a percentage of consolidated revenue  franchise agents share of gross profit was for both fiscal and fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  the company sold one of its franchise agents operations back to the franchise agent 
these sold operations comprised of total domestic revenue for the fiscal year ended october   and represented four of the company s franchise agent offices in operation on october  selling and administrative expenses increased million  or for the fiscal year as compared fiscal primarily due to higher exchange rates used to translate international local currency expenses into us dollars 
as a percentage of revenue these expenses decreased from to largely as a result of the company generating revenue increases of in the current year while limiting selling and administrative expenditure increases to only 
selling and administrative expenses for the fiscal year include a million gain on the sale of the company s remaining unoccupied corporate headquarters building 
depreciation and amortization decreased million or  primarily due to reduced capital expenditures  assets becoming fully depreciated and the sales of the company s corporate headquarters buildings 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company received an unfavorable arbitration ruling relating to a contract dispute with one of its vendors 
total costs associated with this claim  including the arbitration award plus related attorneys fees  were million for fiscal fiscal included a charge of million for an unfavorable california appellate court decision  which reversed a superior court ruling regarding a binding arbitration award issued in january of interest expense increased million for fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily as a result of higher average borrowings outstanding during the year combined with higher average interest rates 
additionally  fiscal interest expense includes million of interest expense related to the unfavorable arbitration ruling discussed above 
it is currently anticipated that average interest rates will continue to rise during fiscal effective november   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
provides that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but rather are evaluated for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
during fiscal  the company performed tests for impairment in accordance with the new standard 
in the initial test under the transitional provisions of sfas no 
 the company determined that an impairment of million existed in its australia reporting unit 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the impairment was classified as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and resulted in a restatement of the company s net loss for the first fiscal quarter of the company performed its annual impairment valuations in the fourth quarters of fiscal and no additional impairments were identified 
fiscal compared to fiscal total revenue increased million  or for fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to the effect of favorable exchange rates on international revenue 
increases in revenue as a result of slight increases in average bill rates were substantially offset by decreased bill hours 
domestic revenue declined 
the decline was largely attributable to a reduction in sales for certain high volume  low margin government business  as well decreased demand for staffing services due to the lingering effects of the us economic downturn and competitive pricing pressures on bill rates 
the revenue decline also reflects the company s closure or consolidation of underperforming branches 
international revenue increased over fiscal excluding the effect of exchange rate fluctuations  international revenue in fiscal increased with increases of in the united kingdom and in australia offset by net declines in the other international operations 
costs of services increased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal gross margin declined from in fiscal to in fiscal primarily due to decreases in the average markup of bill rates over pay rates  due largely to the highly competitive environment surrounding the temporary staffing industry during fiscal the decline in gross margin was also caused by increased workers compensation costs and higher state unemployment insurance costs  most notably in the states of california  illinois and texas which comprised approximately of total domestic temporary payroll 
workers compensation costs rose to million  or of direct labor for fiscal  up from million  or of direct labor for fiscal continued upward trends in the company s actuarially estimated ultimate costs for all open policy years resulted in an increase in the company s workers compensation accruals for these estimated costs 
although the frequency of the company s claims decreased  rising medical costs and the adverse development of several open claims resulted in the need for increased accruals in fiscal franchise agents share of gross profit increased million  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  franchise agents share of gross profit was for fiscal and for fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company sold its operations in hawaii and these were converted to franchise offices 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  one licensee s operations converted to the franchise agent program and two additional company owned branches were sold and converted to franchise offices 
selling and administrative expenses decreased million  or for fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease  partially offset by higher exchange rates for the international operations  reflects reduced costs through personnel reductions  office closures and controlled spending 
as a percent of revenue  selling and administrative expenses decreased from in fiscal to fiscal the decrease in depreciation and amortization primarily reflects the cessation of goodwill amortization under sfas no 
as noted in goodwill under critical accounting policies above 
in february  a favorable arbitration ruling reduced a january adverse arbitration award and the company determined that million of the recorded liabilities were no longer needed 
subsequent to that ruling  the claimants filed a motion with the superior court to correct and confirm the january arbitration ruling 
the motion was denied  and the claimants then filed an appeal of the denial 
the appellate court overturned the superior court ruling and  as a result  the company recorded a charge to earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal for  interest expense decreased million  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to lower debt levels 
interest income decreased million or during the same period as a result of reduced cash levels 
the provision for income taxes for fiscal consisted of international income tax provisions of million partially offset by certain domestic net tax benefits 
at november   the company maintained valuation allowances equivalent to of its outstanding deferred tax assets  which amounted to million 
liquidity and capital resources the company requires significant amounts of working capital to operate its business and to pay expenses relating to employment of temporary employees 
the company s traditional use of cash is for financing of accounts receivable  particularly during periods of economic upswings and growth and during periods where sales are seasonally high 
temporary personnel are generally paid on a weekly basis while payments from customers are generally received to days after billing 
the company finances its operations primarily through cash generated by its operating activities and borrowings under its revolving credit facilities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the fiscal year ended october  compared to net cash used by operating activities of million for the fiscal year ended november  the increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal is primarily due to positive net income combined with a more beneficial funding program for its workers compensation obligations  whereby the company was able to satisfy its collateral requirements through issuance of letters of credit rather than cash 
these increases were partially offset by increased trade accounts receivable as a result of fiscal s revenue growth 
in fiscal  the company was required to fully fund its workers compensation obligations through cash deposits 
cash used for capital expenditures  which are primarily for management information systems initiatives  other software  computers and peripherals  and office furniture and equipment  totaled million for fiscal the company continues to invest in enhancements and upgrades to its computer based technologies 
on august   the company entered into a license agreement for a new back office system

at november   and through the first quarter of fiscal  the company was out of compliance with certain financial covenants under its multicurrency credit agreement  including a minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda covenant 
in february a fourth amendment to the agreement was executed which  among other things  allowed certain one time addbacks to ebitda for the fiscal period ended november   which corrected the covenant defaults and reset the ebitda and certain other covenants going forward 
effective july   the company and the lenders executed a fifth amendment to the multicurrency credit agreement 
the amendment increased the eligible trade accounts receivable the company uses in calculating the amount it is allowed to borrow  and eliminated previously in place reserves that had reduced the available borrowings  significantly increasing the availability compared to prior periods 
in addition  the amendment lowered the range of margins on bank borrowings and outstanding irrevocable letters of credit  reset the consolidated ebitda covenant going forward and increased allowable capital expenditures for the fiscal year to million 
on january   a sixth amendment to the multicurrency credit agreement was executed 
the amendment  among other things  allows a million add back adjustment to the ebitda covenant at october   for the additional workers compensation charges the company incurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal  as discussed above in results of operations for the fiscal year the add back will assist the company in maintaining its minimum ebitda and fixed charge covenants throughout fiscal at october   the company had million available under the credit facilities and was in compliance with all covenants under its credit agreements

the advance plus accrued interest was repaid on august  the company works to balance its worldwide cash needs through dividends from and loans to its international subsidiaries 
these loans and dividends are limited by the immediate future cash availability and needs of each respective subsidiary  restrictions imposed by the company s senior secured debt facilities and  in some cases  statutory regulations of the subsidiary 
the us operations cannot directly draw on the excess borrowing availability of the uk or australian operations  however  the company may request dividends from the uk 
during fiscal  the uk utilized cash from operations and excess borrowing capacity to pay dividends to the us totaling million 
the us can also request repayments on its intercompany loan to australia  along with intercompany interest and royalties  although any significant remittances from australia are currently restricted under the terms of the australia credit facility 
however  as a result of positive operating performance in australia in fiscal and fiscal  the company was notified by its australian lender that these restrictions will be reduced or eliminated during fiscal outstanding principal on the intercompany loan to australia was million on october the company is responsible for and pays workers compensation costs for its temporary and regular employees and is self insured for the deductible amount related to workers compensation claims  per claim for fiscal year and  per claim for fiscal each policy year the terms of the agreement with the insurance carrier are renegotiated

at october   the company had million of outstanding letters of credit to secure its domestic workers compensation obligations 
during fiscal  the company was cash collateralizing its fiscal policy year through payments totaling million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company and its insurance carrier negotiated the return of this cash collateral and the company issued million of letters of credit in its place

contractual obligations the following summarizes the company s contractual cash obligations in future fiscal years in millions as of october  payment due by period contractual obligations total less than one fiscal year to fiscal years to fiscal years more than fiscal years credit facilities promissory note operating leases workers compensation policy year capital lease total contractual obligations the credit agreement expires in may  but the company s lenders could require accelerated payment of amounts outstanding under the credit facilities in the event of default on one or more of the debt covenants contained therein 
payments under the promissory note are subject to certain restrictions regarding borrowing capacity and compliances within the company s senior secured credit facilities 
workers compensation obligations for policy year are based on estimates 
if actual results differ from these estimates the company could be required to make additional payments to  or receive refunds from  its insurance carrier in years subsequent to item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks from transactions that are entered into during the normal course of business 
the company s primary market risk exposure relates to interest rate risk 
at october   the company s outstanding debt under variable rate interest borrowings was approximately million 
a change of in the interest rates would cause a change in interest expense of approximately million on an annual basis 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates is not significant with respect to interest income  as its investment portfolio is not material to its consolidated balance sheet 
the company currently has no plans to hold an investment portfolio that includes derivative financial instruments 
for the fiscal year ended october   the company s international operations comprised of its revenue and  as of the end of that period  of its total assets 
the company is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily due to its investments in foreign subsidiaries 
the company s multicurrency credit facility  which allows the company s australia and united kingdom subsidiaries to borrow in local currencies  partially mitigates the exchange rate risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency denominated net investments in these subsidiaries in relation to the us dollar 
the company does not currently hold any market risk sensitive instruments entered into for hedging transaction risks related to foreign currencies 
in addition  the company has not entered into any transactions with derivative financial instruments for trading purposes
