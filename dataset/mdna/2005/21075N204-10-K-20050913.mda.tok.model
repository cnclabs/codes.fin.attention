item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and other information included elsewhere in this report 
overview contango is a houston based  independent natural gas and oil company 
the company s core business is to explore  develop  produce and acquire natural gas and oil properties primarily offshore in the gulf of mexico and onshore along the gulf coast 
as a recent addition to our business  we will begin acting as an operator on certain offshore prospects through our wholly owned subsidiary  contango operators  inc coi 
the company also owns a interest in a limited partnership formed to develop an lng receiving terminal in freeport  texas  and holds investments in the alternative energy venture capital market with a focus on environmentally preferred energy technologies 
revenues and profitability 
our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and oil and on our ability to find  develop and acquire natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable and the completion and successful operation of our freeport lng project 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets  liabilities and proved natural gas and oil reserves 
we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our natural gas and oil activities 
reserve replacement 
generally  our producing properties onshore along the gulf coast and offshore in the gulf of mexico have high initial production rates  followed by steep declines 
as a result  we must locate and develop or acquire new natural gas and oil reserves to replace those being depleted by production 
substantial capital expenditures are required to find  develop and acquire natural gas and oil reserves 
sale of proved properties 
from time to time as part of our business strategy  we have sold  and in the future may sell some or a substantial portion of our proved reserves to capture current value  using the sales proceeds to further our exploration  lng and alternative energy investment activities 

table of contents use of estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates with regard to these financial statements include estimates of remaining proved natural gas and oil reserves and the timing and costs of our future drilling  development and abandonment activities 
please see risk factors on page for a more detailed discussion of a number of other factors that affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations the following is a discussion of the results of our operations for the fiscal year ended june   compared to the fiscal year ended june  and for the fiscal year ended june   compared to the fiscal year ended june  revenues 
all of our revenues are from the sale of our natural gas and oil production and the settlement of hedging contracts associated with our natural gas and oil production 
our revenues may vary significantly from year to year depending on changes in commodity prices and production volumes 
the table below sets forth revenue and production data for both continuing and discontinued operations the fiscal years ended june   and year ended june  year ended june  revenues natural gas and oil sales gain loss from hedging activities total revenues production natural gas million cubic feet oil and condensate thousand barrels total million cubic feet equivalent natural gas million cubic feet per day oil and condensate thousand barrels per day total million cubic feet per day equivalent average sales price natural gas per thousand cubic feet oil and condensate per barrel operating expenses exploration expenses depreciation  depletion and amortization impairment of natural gas and oil properties general and administrative expenses interest expense interest income gain on sale of marketable securities gain on sale of assets and other not meaningful 
table of contents natural gas and oil sales 
we reported natural gas and oil sales of approximately million for the year ended june   down from approximately million reported for the year ended june  the decrease in revenue was primarily the result of the sale of our south texas natural gas and oil interests for million  completed in december of the million of revenue reported for the year period ended june   million was attributed to the sold properties 
the remaining million of revenue reflects mainly added production from newly added reserves and production from the south texas properties that were not included in the sale 
this compares to million of revenue  excluding revenue from the sold properties  for the year period ended june  we reported natural gas and oil sales of approximately million for the year ended june   down from approximately million reported for the year ended june  this decrease was principally attributable to normal production declines in our existing south texas properties and the sale of non core producing properties in brooks county  texas 
these declines were partially offset by increases in average prices received for our natural gas and oil production 
natural gas and oil production and average sales prices 
our net natural gas production for the year ended june  was approximately mmcf d  down from approximately mmcf d for the year ended june  net oil production for the comparable periods decreased from barrels of oil per day to barrels of oil per day 
the decrease in natural gas and oil production was primarily the result of the sale of our south texas natural gas and oil interests  offset by increased production resulting from additional wells drilled after june  for the year ended june   prices for natural gas and oil were per mcf and per barrel  compared to per mcf and per barrel for the year ended june  for the year ended june   our net natural gas production was approximately mmcf d  down from approximately mmcf d for the year ended june  net oil production for the period was down from barrels of oil per day to barrels of oil per day 
these decreases primarily were due to normal production declines in our existing south texas properties and the sale of non core producing properties in brooks county  texas 
for the year ended june   prices for natural gas and oil were per mcf and per barrel  up from per mcf and per barrel for the year ended june  gain loss from hedging activities 
the company did not engage in any hedging activity for the year ended june  we reported a gain from hedging activities for the year ended june  of approximately  for the year ended june   we reported a loss from hedging activities of approximately million 
this loss included an approximate million realized loss on various swap  put and call agreements that was offset by an unrealized gain of about  operating expenses 
operating expenses  including severance taxes  for the year ended june  were approximately million 
included in this amount was approximately million of lease operating expense  approximately million for workover costs and a million credit for production and severance taxes 
the railroad commission of texas has extended a natural gas incentive allowing for severance tax reduction on tight sand gas wells 
as a result  some of our south texas queen city formation properties are eligible for severance tax reduction 
comparable low levels of severance taxes should not necessarily be expected in future reporting periods 
operating expenses  including severance taxes  for the year ended june  were approximately million  down from the million reported for the year ended june  of the million reported for the year ended june   approximately million was attributable to lease operating expense and approximately million was attributable to production and severance taxes 
the decrease in operating expenses for the year ended june  was attributable to lower production and the extension of a natural gas incentive by the railroad commission of texas to allow for severance tax reduction on tight sand gas wells 
as a result  some of our south texas queen city formation properties were eligible for severance tax reduction 

table of contents exploration expense 
we reported approximately million of exploration expenses for the year ended june  of this amount  approximately million was related to unsuccessful wells drilled in south texas million and the gulf of mexico million during the period  approximately million was attributable to the cost to acquire and reprocess d seismic data both onshore along the gulf coast and offshore in the gulf of mexico  and million was attributable to the cost of delay rentals 
we reported approximately million of exploration expenses for the year ended june  of this amount  approximately million was attributable to dry holes drilled in south texas million and to our unsuccessful well drilled in france million  approximately million was attributable to seismic costs and delay rentals associated with activities onshore in south texas and approximately million was attributable to seismic costs and delay rentals associated with activities offshore in the gulf of mexico 
we reported approximately million of exploration expenses for the year ended june  of this amount  approximately million was attributable to the cost to acquire and reprocess d seismic data offshore in the gulf of mexico  approximately million was the cost to shoot and to acquire d seismic in south texas and approximately million was related to dry hole costs in south texas 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization for the year ended june  was approximately million 
for the year ended june   we recorded approximately million of depreciation  depletion and amortization 
the decrease in depreciation  depletion and amortization was primarily the result of the sale of our south texas properties 
there was no depreciation  depletion and amortization expense recorded in the second and third quarters of related to those properties since those properties were classified as held for sale as of october depreciation  depletion and amortization for the fiscal years ended june  and were approximately million and million  respectively 
depreciation  depletion and amortization for these periods was attributable primarily to depletion and amortization related to production onshore in south texas 
the decrease in was primarily due to lower levels of production and a lower unit depreciation  depletion and amortization rate 
impairment of natural gas and oil properties 
we reported an impairment of natural gas and oil properties of approximately million for the year ended june  this was attributable in part to a million write down of costs associated with offshore lease properties owned by our subsidiary  magnolia offshore exploration  of which contango owns 
the remaining million was attributable to a write down of costs associated with a small barnett shale exploratory play undertaken during the summer of that has had only marginal success 
impairment expense for the year ended june  and was approximately  and  respectively 
these related to impairment of properties held by rex and moe 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  were approximately million  up from million for the year ended june  major components of general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  included approximately million in salaries and benefits  million in bonuses  million in office administration and other expenses  million in insurance costs  million in legal and other professional fees and other administrative expenses  and million related to the cost of expensing stock options

also included in total general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  was approximately million related to the cost of expensing stock options  million related to our gulf of mexico exploration activities  million for board compensation expense and million in other expenses 

table of contents interest expense 
interest expense for the fiscal years ended june   and were approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
the higher levels of interest for the fiscal years and were attributable to higher levels of bank debt during such periods 
the lower level of interest in fiscal year was attributable to the company retiring all of its long term debt in the second quarter of fiscal year gain on sale of assets and other 
we reported other income of approximately million for the year ended june   which represented a million gain on the sale of our south texas natural gas and oil interests  a million unrealized gain recorded as a result of a mark to market increase in the value of our alternative energy investments  offset by approximately million in operating losses related to our alternative energy investments 
for the year ended june   we reported an approximate million gain on the sale of assets 
in september  we sold properties within our south texas exploration program consisting of wells in brooks county  texas for million  reporting a gain of approximately million attributable to this producing property sale 
in december  contango and its owned subsidiary  republic exploration llc  sold their producing gulf of mexico leases for approximately million 
as a result of this sale  contango recorded a gain of approximately million as of june  properties included in the sale were eugene island  grand isle and high island l 
because the interests sold were unearned back in working interests  contango had no proved reserves attributable to the properties sold 
capital resources and liquidity cash inflow 
during the year ended june   we funded our investing and financing activities with internally generated cash flow from operations of million  net of income taxes 
during the year we drilled a total of wells  four of which were successful and nine of which were dry holes 
in december  we completed the sale of the majority of our south texas natural gas and oil interests to edge petroleum corporation 
proceeds from the asset sale after netting adjustments were million 
cash outflow 
during the year ended june   we invested million in exploration and development activities net of reimbursements and advances  million in our prospect generation and exploration subsidiaries  million in our owned freeport lng project  and million in alternative energy companies vis vis our investment in the contango capital partners fund  lp the fund 
during the year ended june   we paid a net of million on financing activities  which included the net repayment of million in long term debt and million in preferred stock dividends  offset by million received through the exercise of stock options and warrants and a million tax benefit related to the exercise of stock options 
we invested excess cash proceeds of million in short term investments consisting of a portfolio of periodic auction reset par securities  which have coupons that periodically reset to market interest rates at intervals ranging from to days 
these par securities are being classified as short term investments and consist of aaa rated tax exempt municipal bonds 
par securities are highly liquid and have minimal interest rate risk 
subsequent sources and uses of cash 
in july  the fund invested million in its fifth portfolio company  moblize  which develops real time diagnostics and field optimization solutions for the oil and gas industry initially  and by using open standards based technologies 
our limited partnership investment share was approximately million 
on july   we sold million of our series d preferred stock to a group of private investors 
the series d preferred stock is perpetual and cumulative  is senior to our common stock and is 
table of contents convertible at any time into shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the dividend on the series d preferred stock can be paid quarterly in cash at a rate of per annum or paid in kind at a rate of per annum 
on september   we purchased an additional of our partially owned subsidiary rex for million and an additional of coe for million from jex 
as a result of these two purchases  our equity ownership interest in these partially owned subsidiaries increased from to in rex and from to in coe 
as of september  we have approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments and have no debt 
the company currently has production of approximately  mcf d 
based on current prices and production rates  the company anticipates ebitdax of approximately million per month 
capital budget 
our current capital expenditure budget for prospect generation  exploration and development activities for the remainder of calendar year is projected to be approximately million  which calls for us to drill two offshore wells as the operator  six onshore wells as non operator  and to be carried in another two offshore wells as a non operator 
the onshore portion of our capital budget calls for us to invest approximately million in the acquisition of additional fayetteville shale lease acreage  and approximately million in drilling costs related to onshore prospects 
in the offshore portion where we will participate as a non operator  we will be fully carried in the main pass and west cameron prospects 
in the offshore portion of our capital budget where coi will invest and operate  we will drill two prospects  eugene island our dutch prospect and grand isle our liberty prospect 
we expect to begin drilling our two offshore exploration wells prior to calendar year end though the after effects of hurricane katrina could significantly alter expected rig availability and timing 
contango s combined capital commitment for both wells is estimated at million  or million per well 
this represents a major increase in the risk profile of the company which has never operated and which in the past has limited its dry hole risk exposure on any one well to approximately million 
our estimated cost commitment could be significantly larger if we encounter difficultly in drilling these wells 
a majority of the projected million capital commitment for prospect generation  exploration and development is concentrated in three prospects our fayetteville shale play at million and two offshore exploration prospects at million each 
thus a total of million will be risked on just three prospects 
these significantly larger capital commitments greatly increase the potential risk and reward to the company in comparison to our historical commitments made for prospects 
in addition to our capital expenditure budget for prospect generation  exploration and development activities  we expect to invest an additional million at our freeport lng project for the remaining calendar year  which includes our share of the budgeted costs for phase i construction as well as budgeted costs required for the engineering and development of a possible phase ii expansion 
in addition  we expect to invest an additional million in the contango capital partners fund  lp in order to fulfill our million commitment made in january we believe that our cash on hand  our cash equivalents  our short term investments and our anticipated cash flow from operations will be adequate to provide working capital for on going operations  to fund our exploration and development programs  to maintain our limited partnership interest in freeport lng  including any potential expansion in terminal capacity  to fund our remaining commitment to the fund  and to satisfy general corporate needs 
we may seek additional equity  sell assets or seek other financing to fund our exploration program and to take advantage of other opportunities that may become available 
the availability of such funds will depend upon prevailing market conditions and other factors over which we have no control  as well as our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents income taxes 
during the year ended june   we paid million in estimated income taxes  in large part related to the sale of our south texas natural gas and oil interests 
contractual obligations presented below are our contractual commitments for the periods indicated 
see credit facility below for a description of our secured  reducing revolving bank line of credit 
fiscal year ending june  total thereafter office lease office equipment total credit facility the company s credit facility with guaranty bank  fsb is a secured  revolving line of credit  secured by the company s natural gas and oil reserves 
as of june   the company had no long term debt outstanding 
as of june   the company s long term debt totaled million  all of which was outstanding under tranche a of the line of credit 
the average interest rate on the company s long term debt at june  was 
prior to the closing the sale of its south texas natural gas and oil interests to edge petroleum corporation in december  the company repaid all of its long term debt outstanding under the facility 
our south texas properties that were sold to edge petroleum constituted the bulk of the assets used to secure our existing bank line 
although the company has no debt outstanding as of june   the revolving line of credit is being maintained and provides for a borrowing capacity of million and matures on june  borrowings will bear interest  at the company s option  at either i libor plus two percent or ii the bank s base rate plus one fourth percent per annum 
additionally  the company pays a quarterly commitment fee of three eighths percent per annum on the average availability 
the hydrocarbon borrowing base is subject to semi annual redetermination based primarily on the value of our proved reserves 
the credit facility requires the maintenance of certain ratios  including those related to working capital  funded debt to ebitdax  and debt service coverage  as defined in the credit agreements 
additionally  the credit agreements contain certain negative covenants that  among other things  restrict or limit our ability to incur indebtedness  sell assets  pay dividends and reacquire or otherwise acquire or redeem capital stock 
failure to maintain required financial ratios or comply with the credit facility s covenants can result in a default and acceleration of all indebtedness under the credit facility 
as of june   the company was in compliance with its financial covenants  ratios and other provisions of its credit facility 
as of september  the company had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments and no debt 
critical accounting policies the application of generally accepted accounting principles involves certain assumptions  judgments  choices and estimates that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
thus  the application of these principles can result in varying results from company to company 
contango s critical accounting principles  which are described below  relate to the successful efforts method for costs related to natural gas and oil activities  and consolidation principles 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the 
table of contents financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates with regard to these financial statements include the estimate of proved natural gas and oil reserve quantities and the related present value of estimated future net cash flows therefrom see supplemental oil and gas disclosures and the mark to market valuation of the fund see footnote 
revenue recognition 
revenues from the sale of natural gas and oil produced are recognized upon the passage of title  net of royalties 
revenues from natural gas production are recorded using the sales method 
when sales volumes exceed the company s entitled share  an overproduced imbalance occurs 
to the extent the overproduced imbalance exceeds the company s share of the remaining estimated proved natural gas reserves for a given property  the company records a liability 
at june  and  the company had no overproduced imbalances 
cash equivalents 
cash equivalents are considered to be highly liquid investment grade debt investments having an original maturity of days or less 
as of june   the company had  in cash and cash equivalents  of which  was invested in highly liquid aaa rated tax exempt money market funds 
cash equivalents are considered to be all highly liquid debt investments having an original maturity of three months or less 
as of june   the company had cash and cash equivalents of short term investments 
as of june   the company had  invested in a portfolio of periodic auction reset par securities  which have coupons that periodically reset to market interest rates at intervals ranging from to days 
these par securities are being classified as short term investments and consist of aaa rated tax exempt municipal bonds 
par securities are highly liquid and have minimal interest rate risk 
marketable equity securities 
all of the company s marketable securities were related to an investment in cheniere energy  inc common stock  which was sold in fiscal year resulting in a gain of  recognized under gain on sale of marketable securities 
net income loss per common share 
basic and diluted net income loss per common share have been computed in accordance with sfas no 
 earnings per share 
basic net income loss per common share is computed by dividing income loss attributable to common stock by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted net income per common share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock 
see footnote for the calculations of basic and diluted net income loss per common share 
income taxes 
the company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of i temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements and ii operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  based upon management s estimates  it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in a future period 
concentration of credit risk 
substantially all of the company s accounts receivable result from natural gas and oil sales or joint interest billings to a limited number of third parties in the natural gas and oil industry 
this concentration of customers and joint interest owners may impact the company s overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions 
consolidated statements of cash flows 
for the purpose of cash flows  the company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity date of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents 
significant transactions may occur which do not directly affect cash balances and  as such  are not disclosed in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
certain such non cash transactions are disclosed in the consolidated statements of shareholders equity  including shares issued as compensation and issuance of stock options 

table of contents fair value of financial instruments 
the carrying amounts of the company s short term financial instruments  including cash equivalents  short term investments  trade accounts receivable and trade accounts payable  approximate their fair values based on the short maturities of those instruments 
the company s long term debt was variable rate debt and  as such  approximated fair value  as interest rates are variable based on prevailing market rates 
successful efforts method of accounting 
the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its natural gas and oil activities 
under the successful efforts method  lease acquisition costs and all development costs are capitalized 
unproved properties are reviewed quarterly to determine if there has been impairment of the carrying value  and any such impairment is charged to expense in the period 
exploratory drilling costs are capitalized until the results are determined 
if proved reserves are not discovered  the exploratory drilling costs are expensed 
other exploratory costs  such as seismic costs and other geological and geophysical expenses  are expensed as incurred 
the provision for depreciation  depletion and amortization is based on the capitalized costs as determined above 
depreciation  depletion and amortization is on a cost center by cost center basis using the unit of production method  with lease acquisition costs amortized over total proved reserves and other costs amortized over proved developed reserves 
when circumstances indicate that proved properties may be impaired  the company compares expected undiscounted future cash flows on a cost center basis to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset 
if the future undiscounted cash flows  based on the company s estimate of future natural gas and oil prices and operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves  are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost  then the capitalized cost is reduced to fair market value 
on july   the company changed its accounting policy for amortizing and impairing the company s natural gas and oil properties from a well by well cost center basis to a field by field cost center basis 
management believes this policy is preferable in these circumstances to have greater comparability with other successful efforts natural gas and oil companies by conforming to predominant industry practice 
in addition  the field level is consistent with the company s operational and strategic assessment of its natural gas and oil investments 
the company determined that the cumulative effect of the change in accordance with apb opinion no 
was immaterial to the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company classified our recent property sale to edge petroleum as discontinued operations 
see note sale of properties discontinued operations of the notes to financial statements included in part ii  item it is our intent  however  to remain an independent natural gas and oil company engaged in the exploration  production  and acquisition of natural gas and oil 
principles of consolidation 
the company s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of contango oil gas company and its subsidiaries and affiliates  after elimination of all intercompany balances and transactions 
wholly owned subsidiaries are fully consolidated 
exploration and development subsidiaries not wholly owned  such as owned rex  owned moe  and owned coe  each as of june   are not controlled by the company and are proportionately consolidated 
by agreement  rex  moe and coe have disproportionate allocations of their profits and losses among the owners 
accordingly  the company determines its income or losses from the ventures based on a hypothetical liquidation determination of how increases or decreases in the book value of the ventures net assets will ultimately affect the cash payments to the company in the event of dissolution 
by agreement  since the company was the only owner that contributed cash to rex and moe  the company consolidated of the ventures net assets and results of operations until the ventures expended all of the company s initial cash contributions 
subsequent to that event  the owners share in the net assets of the ventures is based on their stated ownership percentages 
by agreement  the owners in coe immediately share in the net assets of coe  including the company s initial cash contribution  based on their stated ownership percentages 
the other owners of rex  moe and coe contributed seismic data and related geological and geophysical services to the ventures 

table of contents contango s limited partnership interest in freeport lng is accounted for at cost 
as a limited partner  the company has no ability to direct or control the operations or management of the general partner 
contango s ownership in ccpm and contango s limited partnership interest in contango capital partners  lp are accounted for using the equity method 
under the equity method  only contango s investment in and amounts due to and from the equity investee are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
recent accounting pronouncements 
the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued several new pronouncements  including interpretation no 
revised december fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb  statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the primary objectives of fin r are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights these entities are referred to as variable interest entities or vies and how to determine if a business enterprise should consolidate the vies 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity for which either the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest  or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in addition  fin r requires that all enterprises with a significant variable interest in a vie make additional disclosures regarding their relationship with the vie 
the adoption of fin r had no effect on the company s financial statements 
sfas amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and hedging activities under sfas the amendments set forth in sfas require that contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for similarly 
sfas is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  with limited exceptions and for hedging relationships designated after june  the guidance is to be applied prospectively only 
the adoption of sfas had no effect on the company s financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued their proposed interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for uncertain tax positions fsp fas 
their proposed interpretation seeks to reduce the significant diversity in practice associated with financial statement recognition and measurement in accounting for income taxes 
as proposed  the interpretation will become effective at the end of the first fiscal year ending after december  management has not yet determined the effect that the interpretation will have on the company 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections which replaces accounting principles board opinions no 
accounting changes and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes retrospective application  or the latest practicable date  as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle and the reporting of a correction of an error 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  and is required to be adopted by the company in the first quarter of in april  the fasb issued staff position no 
fas  accounting for suspended well costs fsp fas 
fsp fas amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies  to allow continued capitalization of exploratory well costs beyond one year from the date drilling was completed under circumstances where the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the enterprise is 
table of contents making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project 
fsp fas also amends sfas no 
to require enhanced disclosures of suspended exploratory well costs in the notes to the financial statements for annual and interim periods when there has been a significant change from the previous disclosure 
the guidance in fsp fas is effective for the first reporting period beginning after april  the company adopted the new requirements in its form k for the period ended june  the adoption of fsp fas did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas r  share based payment 
this statement requires the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements at their fair value on the grant date 
sfas r is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  in april  the securities and exchange commission issued a rule that amends the date for compliance with sfas r 
as a result  the company will adopt this statement on july  stock based compensation 
prior to the fiscal year ended june   the company accounted for employee stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under the intrinsic method  compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the fair value of the company s common stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the common stock 
effective july   the company prospectively changed its method of accounting for employee stock based compensation to the fair value based method prescribed in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
under the fair value based method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the award vesting period 
the fair value of each award is estimated as of the date of grant using the black scholes options pricing model 
the company has determined that the fair value method is preferable to the intrinsic value method previously applied 
during the years ended june   and  the company recorded a charge of   and  to general and administrative expense  respectively 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
contango previously has entered into commodity derivatives contracts and fixed price physical contracts to manage its exposure to natural gas and oil price volatility 
commodity derivatives contracts  which are usually placed with investment grade companies that the company believes are minimal credit risk  may take the form of futures contracts  swaps or options 
the natural gas and oil reference prices upon which these commodity derivatives contracts are based reflect various market indices that have a high degree of historical correlation with actual prices received by the company 
the table below sets forth the company s hedging activities for the periods indicated year ended june  mark to market reversal of prior period unrealized recognized loss gain net cash received paid from swap settlements options purchased mark to market loss unrealized gain loss from hedging activities 
table of contents although the company s hedging transactions generally have been designed as economic hedges for a portion of future natural gas and oil production  the company elected not to designate the derivative instruments as hedges under sfas as a result  gains and losses  representing changes in these derivative instruments mark to market fair values  were recognized in the company s earnings 
the company had no open commodity derivative contracts at june  and has a policy to hedge only through the purchase of puts 
asset retirement obligation 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  as of july  sfas requires the company to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation aro in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  a company increases the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
activities related to the company s aro during the year ended june  and are as follows year ended june  initial aro as of july liabilities incurred during period liabilities settled during period accretion expense balance of aro as of june item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk commodity risk 
our major commodity price risk exposure is to the prices received for our natural gas and oil production 
realized commodity prices received for our production are the spot prices applicable to natural gas and crude oil 
prices received for natural gas and oil are volatile and unpredictable and are beyond our control 
for the year ended june   a fluctuation in the prices received for natural gas and oil production would have had an approximate million impact on our revenues 
hedging activities 
due to the significant volatility in natural gas prices and the potential risk of significant hedging losses if nymex natural gas prices spike on the date options settle  our policy is to hedge only through the purchase of puts
