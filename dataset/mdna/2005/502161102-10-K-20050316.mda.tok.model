overview we design  develop  manufacture and market complex  high performance integrated circuits and storage systems 
we operate in two segments the semiconductor segment and the storage systems segment 
within the semiconductor segment  we offer three enabling system on a chip technologies standard cell asics  platform asics and application specific standard products that are focused on the consumer  communication and storage component markets 
within the storage systems segment we focus on high performance modular disk storage systems  sub assemblies and storage management software 
our products are marketed primarily to original equipment manufacturers oems that sell products targeted for applications in these markets 
our business is characterized by rapid technological change  competitive pricing pressures and cyclical market patterns 
our financial results are affected by a wide variety of factors  including general economic conditions worldwide  economic conditions specific to the semiconductor and storage systems industries  the timely implementation of new technologies and the ability to safeguard inventions and other intellectual 
table of contents property in a rapidly evolving market 
in addition  the semiconductor and storage systems markets have historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns at various times 
we reported revenues of  million in  a slight increase over  million in we reported a net loss for the year ended december  of million or loss per diluted share  largely as a result of million in charges for restructuring of operations and other items  net recorded in the second half of the year 
the charges were the result of our initiation of a comprehensive restructuring program  which included asset impairments  primarily related to our gresham manufacturing facility  a global reduction in workforce and the consolidation of certain non manufacturing leased facilities 
the restructuring activities were triggered by the decline in revenues in the semiconductor industry and a corresponding decline in our outlook as of the latter part of the third quarter of for a complete discussion of our restructuring actions  see the restructuring of operations and other items  net section later in this md a 
we continued the build out of the rapidchip platform asic infrastructure during our customer base for rapidchip technology encompasses a range from small start up companies to major system oems throughout all of our geographic markets 
markets for our rapidchip platform asic solutions include communications  storage  consumer  industrial and others 
design wins and product shipments for rapidchip platform products increased during as compared to we generated million and million in cash from operations during and  respectively 
we reduced our long term debt to million as of december   through open market purchases in of approximately million of our convertible subordinated notes due in through the restructuring actions taken during  we continued to improve our cost structure and align our resources to higher value opportunities 
we have adopted a balanced manufacturing strategy in the semiconductor segment  supplementing the capabilities of our gresham manufacturing facility with strategic foundry engagements with partners in taiwan  japan  china and malaysia 
we expect revenue growth in to be driven by our strong technology and market share in products such as semiconductors used in dvd recorder products  ultra scsi controllers  sas serial attached scsi  fibrechannel  raid adapters  our rapidchip platform asics  and modular scalable storage systems 
separation of our storage systems business 
on november   we announced our intention to separate our storage systems operations engenio information technologies  inc engenio or storage systems segment and create an independent storage systems company 
a more comprehensive discussion of the separation and related agreements is set forth in note of the notes 
on february   engenio filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission for the initial public offering of its common stock 
on july   lsi announced jointly with engenio the postponement of the initial public offering of its common stock due to then current market conditions 
significant acquisitions and other major transactions 
we are continually exploring strategic acquisitions that build upon our existing library of intellectual property  human capital  including engineering talent  and seeking to increase our leadership position in the markets in which we operate 
all of our acquisitions in and were accounted for as purchases and accordingly  the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the results of operations were included in our consolidated financial statements as of the effective date of each acquisition 
the transactions are summarized below 
there were no significant differences between our accounting policies and those of the companies acquired 
see note of the notes

on august   we filed with the securities and exchange commission an offer to exchange stock options outstanding under the equity incentive plan and the nonstatutory stock option plan for new options 
under the exchange offer  eligible employees had the opportunity to exchange eligible stock options for the promise to grant new options under the nonstatutory stock option plan 
our directors and executive officers were not eligible to participate in this program 
the exchange offer expired on september   and we accepted options to purchase an aggregate of  shares for exchange 
on march   we granted a new option that covered two shares of lsi logic common stock for every three shares covered by an option that an employee had elected to exchange 
the exercise price per share of the new options was equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date 
we granted options to purchase  shares at an exercise price of per share 
the exchange program did not result in the recording of any compensation expense in the statement of operations 

table of contents where more than one significant factor contributed to changes in results from year to year  we have quantified such factors throughout the management s discussion analysis md a where practicable and useful to the discussion 
results of operations revenues year ended december  in millions semiconductor segment storage systems segment consolidated there were no significant inter segment revenues during the periods presented 
compared to total consolidated revenues for increased million or less than one percent as compared to revenues for the semiconductor segment decreased million or in as compared to the decrease in revenues in the semiconductor segment is primarily attributable to a decrease in average selling prices and demand for semiconductors used in video game products  and a decrease in demand for semiconductors used in office automation products and enterprise switch products 
these decreases were offset in part by the following increases in demand for semiconductors used in storage product applications such as our ultra scsi and ultra raid products  as well as asics used in hard disk drives and host adapter boards 
the ultra product line was introduced in the latter part of increases in demand for semiconductors used in consumer product applications such as dvd recorders 
we introduced our dvd recorder semiconductor product in the latter part of and early increases in demand for semiconductors used in communication product applications such as wireless solutions 
revenues for the storage systems segment increased million or in from the increase in revenues in the storage systems segment was primarily attributable to increased demand from ibm  storagetek and the teradata division of ncr for our entry level controller products that were introduced in late april and increased demand for our other controller and disk enclosure related products 
in addition to our introduction of the new entry level controller product  we believe that the increased demand from our largest customers was driven by the trend toward purchasing modular storage systems  our increased focus on sales of our products to our channel customers  the economic rebound that began in the middle of  increased spending on information technology by organizations and increased outsourcing by oems 
we expect total consolidated revenues in the first quarter of to be within a range of million to million 
compared to total consolidated revenues for decreased million or as compared to revenues for the semiconductor segment decreased million or in as compared to the previous year 
the decline in revenues was primarily attributable to lower demand for our semiconductors sold into certain product applications such as set top box  dvd playback  video games and applications for the wide area network wan market 
the above noted declines in revenues were partially offset by growth in revenues 
table of contents from semiconductors used in product applications such as dvd recorders  ultra scsi and asics supplied to the disk drive industry 
revenues for the storage systems segment increased million or in from the increase was due to a significant increase in sales to ibm  from million in to million in as a percentage of storage systems revenues  revenues from ibm increased to in from in the increase in revenues from ibm was primarily due to growth in demand for our high performance controller products and an entry level controller product introduced during the year  together with the enclosure products that are generally sold with these controllers 
in addition  this increase was due to ibm s purchases of products added to our product line pursuant to the acquisition of ibm s mylex business unit in august growth in the demand for our premium software features also contributed to an increase in revenues 
the growth in revenues for over was offset in part by a decrease in aggregate revenues of million from storagetek and the teradata division of ncr 
as a percentage of storage systems revenues  sales to these two customers decreased in as compared to significant customers 
the following table summarizes the number of our significant customers  each of whom accounted for or more of our revenues  along with the percentage of revenues they individually represent on a consolidated basis and by segment year ended december  semiconductor segment number of significant customers percentage of segment revenues storage systems segment number of significant customers percentage of segment revenues consolidated number of significant customers percentage of consolidated revenues revenues by geography 
the following table summarizes our revenues by geography year ended december  in millions revenues north america asia  including japan europe total revenues by geography are accumulated based on the revenues generated by our subsidiaries located within the three geographic areas noted in the above table 
in  engenio formed new subsidiaries within europe 
these subsidiaries recorded approximately million in revenues 
in prior years  all revenues generated by engenio in europe were reported in north america 
in  revenues decreased in north america and asia  including japan  while increasing in europe as compared to the decrease in revenues in north america is primarily attributable to a decrease in revenues for modular storage products associated with engenio as a result of the allocation of revenue to the newly formed subsidiaries in europe  as discussed above  a decrease in demand for semiconductors used in storage and consumer product applications  such as cable and set top box solutions 
the decrease in north america was offset in part by an increase in demand for semiconductors used in communication product applications such as routers  switches and wireless solutions 
the decrease in revenues in asia  including 
table of contents japan  is primarily due to decreased demand for semiconductors used in consumer product applications  such as video game products  and semiconductors used in communication product applications  such as office automation products and switches 
the decrease in asia  including japan  was offset in part by an increase in demand for semiconductors used in consumer product applications  such as dvd recorders  and semiconductors used in storage product applications  such as hard disk drives and our ultra product line 
the increase in europe is a result of the allocation of revenue to the newly formed subsidiaries in europe for engenio as previously discussed  offset in part by decreased demand across all semiconductor product applications 
in  revenues declined in all geographic regions as compared to the decline in revenues in north america for was mainly due to the continued economic downturn in the united states 
the decline in revenues in asia  including japan  in compared to is primarily attributable to lower demand for our semiconductors used in certain consumer product applications such as dvd playback and video games 
the decline in revenues for asia  including japan  was partially offset by growth in revenues from semiconductors used in consumer product applications such as dvd recorders and semiconductors used in storage product applications such as ultra scsi and asics supplied to the disk drive industry

in  we continued to see an increase  as a percentage of total storage systems revenues  in the sale of entry level controller and related drive products  which have lower gross profit margins than other products offered within the storage systems segment 
compared to in september  we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the tsukuba  japan facility to rohm  a japanese company 
the sale closed during november for billion yen approximately million 
see note of the notes 
with these actions  we completed the consolidation of our internal manufacturing into our gresham  oregon campus  supplemented by strategic foundry relationships from which we acquire wafers 
utilizing a diversity of manufacturing sources allows us to better manage our manufacturing needs  including investment in and access to world class process technology 
the consolidated gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in the following factors were primarily attributable to the improvement in gross profit margins in as compared to lower charges for obsolete and unmarketable inventories in as compared to in the semiconductor segment  lower manufacturing variances associated primarily with yield improvements in related to our micron technology  lower compensation related costs for manufacturing in the semiconductor segment  higher sales of previously reserved inventory 
in  sales of previously reserved inventory improved gross profit margins by less than one percentage point as compared to sales of previously reserved inventory in the majority of this improvement in gross profit margin was in the semiconductor segment  a favorable change in product mix for the semiconductor segment during  and 
table of contents a favorable change in product mix for the storage systems segment  offset by higher compensation related costs  due to headcount increases  and higher freight costs incurred during the gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues for the semiconductor segment increased to from 
the gross profit margin improved in as compared to  even though semiconductor segment revenues were lower in as compared to the following factors were primarily attributable to the improvement in the semiconductor segment s gross profit margins in as compared to lower charges for obsolete and unmarketable inventories in as compared to  lower manufacturing variances associated primarily with yield improvements in related to our micron technology  lower compensation related costs for manufacturing  a favorable change in product mix during  and higher sales of previously reserved inventory

offsetting this increase were higher compensation related costs for manufacturing  due to headcount increases  and higher freight costs incurred during research and development year ended december  in millions semiconductor segment percentage of segment revenues storage systems segment percentage of segment revenues consolidated percentage of revenues compared to research and development r d expenses  on a consolidated basis  decreased million or during as compared to r d expenses for the semiconductor segment decreased million or in as compared to the decrease is primarily a result of benefits from the cost cutting measures implemented as part of the restructuring actions in and see note of the notes including lower compensation related costs and benefits from the consolidation of our non manufacturing facilities 
in addition  we had lower equipment related costs as a result of entering into two equipment operating leases to replace two existing operating leases for the same equipment in the third quarter of  the buyout and write down of the purchased equipment from the new operating leases in the fourth quarter of  and certain assets becoming fully depreciated during we develop advanced sub micron product technologies 
we continued the build out of the rapidchip platform asic infrastructure in products utilizing rapidchip technology combine the high density  high performance and proven intellectual property benefits of cell based asics with the advantages of lower development costs and faster time to market 
we expect products utilizing rapidchip technology to have performance comparable to cell based asics at a cost significantly lower than field programmable gate 
table of contents arrays fpgas 
markets for our rapidchip platform asic solutions include communications  storage  consumer  industrial and others 
our customer base for rapidchip technology encompasses a range from small start up companies to major system oems throughout all of our geographic markets 
design wins and product shipments for rapidchip platform products increased during as compared to r d expenses for the storage systems segment consist primarily of employee salaries and materials used in product development  as well as deprecation of capital equipment and facilities 
in addition to the significant resources required to support hardware technology transitions  we devote significant resources to developing and enhancing software features and functionality to remain competitive 
r d expenses for the storage systems segment increased by million or in as compared to this is primarily a result of increased compensation costs due to higher headcount  higher expenses for outside service providers related to development programs and higher depreciation expense related to assets purchased for product development 
compared to r d expenses  on a consolidated basis  decreased million or during as compared to r d expenses for the semiconductor segment decreased million or in as compared to the decrease in r d expenses for the semiconductor segment is primarily due to benefits from the cost cutting measures implemented as part of the restructuring actions of to see note of the notes 
the decrease was offset in part because the technology transfer agreement entered into with silterra during ended in  which included a benefit of million for we continued the build out of the current generation rapidchip platform infrastructure in we shipped our first rapidchip platform products in the fourth quarter of r d expenses for the semiconductor segment increased to of revenues in from in r d expenses for the storage systems segment increased by million or in as compared to the increase primarily resulted from our strategy to invest in r d programs to enhance the features  functionality and performance of our existing products and to add new products to our portfolio 
in particular  we incurred additional r d expenses in as a result of hiring additional r d employees in connection with our august acquisition of ibm s mylex business unit

restructuring of operations and other items  net we recorded net charges of million in restructuring of operations and other items for the year ended december   consisting of million in charges for restructuring of operations and impairment of long lived assets and a gain of million for other items 
of these charges  million was recorded in the semiconductor segment and million was included in the storage systems segment 
in  we expect to realize savings of approximately million as a result of these restructuring actions 

table of contents restructuring and impairment of long lived assets first quarter of we recorded a gain of million on the sale of fixed assets that had previously been held for sale and an expense of million for the abandonment of fixed assets that had previously been held for sale 
in addition  an expense of million was recorded for the write down of fixed assets due to impairment 
an expense of million was recorded to reflect the change in time value of accruals for facility lease termination costs  net of adjustments for changes in sublease assumptions for certain previously accrued facility lease termination costs 
an expense of million was recorded primarily for severance and termination benefits for four employees involved in research and development 
second quarter of we recorded a gain of million on the sale of fixed assets that had previously been held for sale and an expense of million primarily for the write down of the colorado springs fabrication facility to reflect a decline in fair market value and to write down certain spare parts for fixed assets 
an expense of million was recorded to reflect the change in time value of accruals for facility lease termination costs  net of adjustments for changes in sublease assumptions for certain previously accrued facility lease termination costs 
previously accrued contract termination fees of million were reversed as the result of favorable than expected negotiations to terminate those contracts 
third quarter of as a result of the decline in revenues in the semiconductor industry and a corresponding decline in our outlook as of the latter part of the third quarter of  we initiated a comprehensive restructuring program  which included asset impairments  a global reduction in workforce and the consolidation of certain facilities as described further below 
we concluded in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  that the gresham manufacturing facility assets were impaired 
accordingly  an asset write down of million was recorded in the semiconductor segment during the third quarter of the fair values of impaired equipment and facilities were researched and estimated by management 
we announced workforce reductions of approximately positions worldwide across all job functions and recorded a charge of million in the semiconductor segment for severance and termination benefits 
we recorded a gain of million on the sale of fixed assets that had previously been held for sale and an expense of million for the write down of the colorado springs fabrication facility to reflect a decline in fair market value  the impairment of certain acquired intangible assets in the semiconductor segment and the write down of leasehold improvements related to the facility operating leases discussed below 
in the third quarter of  we consolidated additional non manufacturing facilities and recorded million for costs associated with exiting certain operating leases for real estate as the facilities ceased being used 
an expense of million was recorded to reflect the change in time value of prior accruals for facility lease termination costs 
in addition  an expense of million was recorded for changes in sublease assumptions for certain previously accrued facility lease termination costs 
fourth quarter of in november  we exercised our right to purchase all of the wafer fabrication equipment that had previously been under two operating lease and security agreements 
the purchase amount was million 
cash collateral of million associated with the leases was returned to us 
termination fees under the lease agreements were not significant 
the formerly leased equipment is part of the gresham manufacturing facility  but was not impaired in the third quarter of  because we did not own the equipment until november of  as discussed above 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  after purchasing the previously leased 
table of contents equipment  we recorded an additional impairment charge of million in restructuring of operations and other items within the semiconductor segment 
the charge includes a write down of million to reflect the equipment at fair value  the reversal of a million deferred gain previously recorded in non current liabilities related to the sale leaseback of equipment during  lease termination fees and the write off of capitalized lease fees and deferred rent 
the fair values of the impaired equipment were researched and estimated by management 
in the semiconductor segment  we recorded a gain of million on the sale of fixed assets that had previously been held for sale  an expense of million for the write down of the colorado springs fabrication facility to reflect a decline in fair market value  and an expense of million for the write down of leasehold improvements related to the facility operating leases discussed below and other fixed assets 
during the third quarter of  we reclassified a parcel of land in japan with a book value of million from a long term asset to a current asset held for sale 
the land was part of the total assets in the semiconductor segment 
the land was sold in the fourth quarter of and a gain of million was recorded 
as part of the restructuring program initiated in the third quarter  we decided to discontinue development of a product line in the semiconductor segment that had been acquired in connection with the datapath acquisition in as a result  we performed an analysis of the future net cash flows related to the affected product line and determined that certain acquired intangible assets were impaired 
an impairment charge of million for the write down of the acquired intangible assets to fair market value was recorded in the semiconductor segment 
in the fourth quarter of  we consolidated additional non manufacturing facilities and recorded million for costs associated with exiting certain operating leases for real estate as the facilities ceased being used 
an expense of million was recorded to reflect the change in time value of accruals for facility lease termination costs 
previously accrued lease termination fees of million were reversed as the result of favorable negotiations to terminate those contracts 
we recorded million for additional severance and termination benefits in the semiconductor segment related to the workforce reductions described in the third quarter of above  primarily in europe and the united states due to changes in estimates 
in our storage systems segment  during the fourth quarter  we initiated realignment of our product portfolio and overhead cost structures driven by the future operating and financial performance goals of the storage systems segment 
in connection with this action we recorded a million charge for severance and termination benefits for employees across multiple activities and functions 
in addition  we recorded a charge of million for the write off of previously capitalized software development costs 
we cancelled the related project based upon our determination that this project would not achieve the desired future financial performance goals 
the fair values of impaired equipment and facilities were researched and estimated by management 
given that current market conditions for the sale of older fabrication facilities and related equipment may fluctuate due to demand for used semiconductor equipment  there can be no assurance that we will realize the current net carrying value of the assets held for sale 
we reassess the realizability of the carrying value of these assets at the end of each quarter until the assets are sold or otherwise disposed of and additional adjustments may be necessary 
assets held for sale of million and million were included as a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets as of december  and  respectively 
assets classified as held for sale are not depreciated 
we are making appropriate efforts to sell assets held for sale within the next twelve months

the balance remaining for facility closure and other exit costs is expected to be paid during d amounts utilized represent cash severance payments to employees during the year ended december  the balance remaining for severance benefits is expected to be paid by the end of other items during the second quarter of  we reclassified a parcel of land in colorado with a book value of million from a long term asset to a current asset held for sale 
the land is part of total assets in the semiconductor segment 
we expect to sell the property within the next months for an amount in excess of book value 
during the third quarter of  we entered into two new lease agreements for wafer fabrication equipment 
the equipment was previously on lease immediately prior to the closing of the new lease agreements 
the company had capitalized and was amortizing fees related to the previous leases 
upon entering into the new lease agreements  million in remaining unamortized fees for the previous leases were recorded as an expense in the statement of operations 
during the third quarter of  we discontinued hedge accounting treatment on the interest rate swap related to the equipment operating leases that were refinanced and recorded the million balance in accumulated comprehensive income as a gain in the statement of operations see note of the notes 
during the fourth quarter of  we released million in accruals that were established in years prior to  because management determined that the accruals were no longer necessary 
we recorded net charges of million in restructuring of operations and other items for the year ended december  consisting of million in charges for restructuring of operations and a gain of million for other items 
of these charges  million was recorded in the semiconductor segment and million was included in the storage systems segment 

table of contents restructuring and impairment of long lived assets on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities

during the year ended december   payments related to the april restructuring actions consisted of approximately million for severance and termination benefits  million for lease and contract terminations and million for other exit costs 
in june  we announced the decision to sell the tsukuba  japan manufacturing facility 
during the second quarter  a charge of million was recorded in the semiconductor segment to write down fixed assets to their fair market value 
the fair value was reclassified from property  plant and equipment to other current assets to reflect the intention to dispose of the facility within the next twelve months 
in addition  approximately million in restructuring charges were recorded in the second quarter for severance and other exit costs 
see further discussion in the third quarter below 
in june  we also recorded million of additional fixed asset write downs to reflect the decrease in fair market value of assets held for sale during the period 
this write down included a reduction in the value of the colorado springs fabrication facility of million to reflect continued and accelerated efforts to sell the facility 
third quarter of agreement to sell japan fabrication facility in september  we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the tsukuba  japan manufacturing facility to rohm  a japanese company 
the sale closed during november for billion yen approximately million 
as part of the definitive agreement  we agreed to purchase a minimum amount of production wafers from rohm for a period of months following the close of the transaction 
as a result  a charge of million was recorded in cost of revenues during the third quarter of this charge is a result of the application of our policy to accrue for non cancelable inventory purchase commitments in excess of months of estimated demand 
included in the million charge to cost of revenues is a reclassification of million from restructuring expense originally recorded in the second quarter of to better reflect the terms of the definitive agreement 
also in the quarter  million was recorded for additional severance benefits to be paid and for contract termination and other exit costs associated with the definitive agreement 

table of contents during the year ended december   payments related to the japan restructuring actions consisted of approximately million for severance and termination benefits and million for lease and contract terminations 
other third quarter restructuring actions in the third quarter of  we continued to consolidate non manufacturing facilities and recorded million for costs associated with exiting certain operating leases for real estate as the facilities ceased being used 
in september  we decided to discontinue development programs and to refocus sales and marketing efforts for certain product lines in the semiconductor segment 
as a result of an analysis of future net cash flows related to the affected product lines  it was determined that certain acquired intangible assets were impaired 
an impairment charge of million related to the write down of the acquired intangible assets to fair market value was recorded in the third quarter of these intangible assets were originally acquired in connection with the acquisition of c cube microsystems in the second quarter of in addition  million in restructuring charges were recorded in the third quarter of these charges related to severance and termination benefits for employees primarily involved in research and development and for certain contract termination costs and fixed asset write downs due to impairment 
the severance benefits were paid during the third quarter of fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of  we reversed approximately million of previously accrued restructuring expenses 
the reversal was primarily due to the combination of a favorable negotiation to terminate leases for real property and severance payments that were lower than expected due to the timing of the sale of the japan manufacturing facility to rohm 
an expense of million was recorded primarily to reflect the change in time value of accruals for facility lease termination costs and the write down of fixed assets due to impairment 
certain other reclassifications were made between asset decommissioning costs and other facility closure costs to reflect changes in management estimates for the remaining costs for these activities 
in december  we recorded million of additional fixed asset write downs to reflect the decrease in fair market value of assets held for sale during the period 
we also recorded a realized gain of million on the sale of fixed assets that had been previously held for sale

we recorded approximately million in restructuring of operations and other items for the year ended december   consisting of million for restructuring of operations  and a gain of million for other items  including the gain on sale of cdma handset product technology 
restructuring of operations and other items were primarily included in the semiconductor segment  the restructuring expense included in the storage systems segment was not significant 
restructuring and impairment of long lived assets in the first quarter of  we announced a set of actions to reduce costs and streamline operations 
these actions included a worldwide reduction in workforce  downsizing our manufacturing operations in tsukuba  japan  and the decision to exit cdma handset product technology 
during the three months ended march   we recorded a restructuring charge for severance for  employees worldwide and exit costs primarily associated with cancelled contracts and operating leases 
as a result of the restructuring actions  we recorded fixed asset write downs due to impairment in the us and japan for assets to be disposed of by sale 
in the second quarter of  we completed the sale of cdma handset product technology to a third party  recognizing a net gain of million 
during the fourth quarter of  we reversed approximately million of previously accrued restructuring expenses 
as a result of our decision to terminate fewer employees than the original plan contemplated in tsukuba  japan  we reversed previously accrued restructuring expenses for termination benefits  including outplacement costs and certain contract termination fees of million 
this was offset by additional expense accruals of million for costs related to the previously announced closure of the colorado springs fabrication facility 
certain other reclassifications were made between lease and contract terminations and facility closure and other exit costs to reflect changes in management estimates for the remaining costs for these activities

amortization of non cash deferred stock compensation amortization of non cash deferred stock compensation of million  million and million was recorded in  and  respectively 
the acquisitions for which deferred stock compensation and related amortization were recorded consisted primarily of the accerant transaction in the second quarter of  the velio transaction in the first quarter of see note of the notes for both acquisitions  an acquisition in the fourth quarter of  the acquisition of c cube  and the raid business from ami in  and the acquisition of datapath in no deferred stock compensation was recorded in connection with the acquisition of the mylex business unit in we also recorded non cash deferred stock compensation for restricted common shares issued to our employees  engenio employees and the non employee directors of engenio during we amortize deferred stock compensation ratably over the related vesting periods 
deferred stock compensation is adjusted to reflect the forfeitures prior to vesting 
at december   the deferred stock compensation that remained was million  which is expected to be amortized over the next four years 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles decreased to million in from million in the decrease is due in part to the write down of intangible assets during  as discussed below 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge in restructuring and other items to write down million of intangible assets originally acquired in connection with the acquisition of datapath  which was added to our 
table of contents semiconductor segment during certain intangible assets became fully amortized during these decreases were offset in part by amortization of intangible assets acquired in the first and second quarters of as of december   we had million of intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization that will continue to amortize 
amortization of intangibles decreased to million in from million in amortization decreased during as a result of the write down in the first quarter of million of intangible assets in the semiconductor segment and million of intangible assets in the storage systems segment 
in the third quarter of we wrote down an additional million of intangible assets originally acquired in connection with the acquisition of c cube microsystems  which was added to our semiconductor segment in the second quarter of the charges were recorded in restructuring and other items  net in see note of the notes 
these decreases were offset in part by a full year of amortization for intangible assets acquired during the third and fourth quarters of interest expense with the objective of protecting our cash flows and earnings from the impact of fluctuations in interest rates  while minimizing the cost of capital  we may enter into or terminate interest rate swaps 
in june  we entered into interest rate swaps the swaps with various investment banks 
the swaps effectively converted fixed interest payments on a portion of our convertible subordinated notes convertible notes to libor based floating rates 
the swaps qualified for hedge accounting treatment 
see note of the notes 
during the second quarter of  we terminated the swaps  resulting in a deferred gain of million that is being amortized as a benefit to interest expense over the remaining term of the hedged convertible notes 
a portion of the deferred gain was written off as part of the net gain or loss on the repurchase redemption of the hedged convertible notes during and as of december   a deferred gain of million was recorded as a component of the convertible notes 
interest expense decreased by million to million in from million in the decrease is due to the repurchase redemption of million of convertible notes during  an additional repurchase of million in the third quarter of and changes in the benefit received from the swaps prior to termination and the benefit from the amortization of the deferred gain after termination of the swaps  offset by the issuance of million of convertible notes during the second quarter of see note of the notes 
our interest expense continued to be below the stated coupon rate of approximately as a result of the swaps on the convertible notes entered into in the second quarter of interest expense decreased by million to million in from million in the decrease is due to the repurchase redemption of million of convertible notes during and million during the decrease from the repurchases and redemptions was partly offset by interest expense on the million of convertible notes issued on may  see note of the notes 
interest income and other  net interest income and other  net  was million in as compared to million in interest income decreased by million to million in from million in the decrease in interest income is mainly due to lower returns on our short term investments during the year ended december  as compared to the same period of other income  net of million in included the following a pre tax gain of million associated with our investment in marketable available for sale equity securities of a certain technology company that was acquired by another publicly traded technology company  a pre tax gain of million on sales of certain marketable available for sale equity securities  a pre tax gain of million on repurchase of convertible notes see note of the notes

other expense of million in included the following a gain of million on the repurchase of a portion of the convertible notes  net of the write off of debt issuance costs associated with the issuance of the convertible notes 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we repurchased and retired million of the million convertible notes issued in and million of the million convertible notes issued in effective january   we early adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no

for all investment in debt and equity securities  unrealized losses are evaluated to determine if they are other than temporary 
the company frequently monitors the credit quality of its investments in marketable debt securities 
in order to determine if impairment has occurred for equity securities  we review the financial performance of each investee  industry performance and outlook for each investee  the trading prices of marketable equity securities and pricing in current rounds of financing for non marketable equity securities 
if an unrealized loss is determined to be other than temporary  a loss is recognized as a component of interest income and other 
for marketable equity securities  the impairment losses were measured using the closing market price of the marketable securities on the date management determined that the investments were impaired 
for non marketable equity securities  the impairment losses were measured by using pricing in current rounds of financing 
provision for income taxes during  we recorded an income tax expense of million  which represents an effective tax rate of approximately 
this rate differs from the us statutory rate primarily due to increases in net deferred tax assets not currently benefited in the us  losses of certain foreign subsidiaries which are benefited at lower rates and earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries taxed in the us the company operates in multiple jurisdictions throughout the world 
the company s income tax expense is primarily related to taxable income in certain foreign jurisdictions  which are not reduced by separate losses in other foreign jurisdictions 
during  we recorded an income tax expense of million  which represents an effective tax rate of approximately 
this rate differs from the us statutory rate primarily due to losses of our foreign 
table of contents subsidiaries  which are not benefited or are benefited at lower rates  earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries taxed in the us  and alternative minimum taxes 
the effect of these charges has been partially offset by the benefit of foreign tax and research and development tax credits 
in  we recorded an income tax expense of million  which represents an effective tax rate of approximately 
this rate differs from the us statutory rate primarily due to losses of our foreign subsidiaries  which are not benefited or are benefited at lower rates  foreign tax expense in certain jurisdictions  and reductions in the value of our deferred tax assets with the corresponding charge to income tax expense of approximately million 
the effect of these charges was partially offset by the expanded net operating loss carry back provided by a law change in  as well as the reversal of taxes previously accrued and the conclusion of a federal income tax audit with the internal revenue service for the income tax years through see note of the notes 
minority interest in net income of subsidiary minority interest in net income of subsidiary was not significant for the periods presented 
the changes in minority interest were attributable to the composition of earnings and losses in our majority owned japanese subsidiary for each of the respective years 
financial condition  capital resources and liquidity cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased to million at december   from million at december  the increase is mainly due to cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities  partially offset by net cash outflows from investing and financing activities as described below 
working capital 
working capital decreased by million to million at december   from million as of december  working capital declined in as a result of the following prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased by million  primarily due to a decrease of million in the current portion of the collateral balance on the equipment operating leases 
during the fourth quarter of  we exercised our right to buyout or purchase all of the wafer fabrication equipment that had previously been under two operating lease and security agreements see note of the notes 
the associated collateral was returned to us  an million decrease in assets held for sale primarily due to write downs as a result of decreases in fair value  as well as sales  net of additions see note of the notes  and the receipt of a million income tax refund in the first quarter of accounts payable increased by million due to the timing of payments 
income taxes payable increased by million due to the timing of tax payments made and the income tax provision recorded in current deferred tax assets  net of current deferred tax liabilities decreased by million due to net changes in underlying temporary differences see note of the notes 
the decrease in working capital was offset  in part  by the following accounts receivable increased by million to million as of december  from million at december  the increase is mainly attributable to slower collections due to some major customers with longer payment terms and fewer customers with letter of credit or cash in advance arrangements in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of 
table of contents inventories increased by million to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase was attributable to a build up in finished goods and raw materials inventories to support future sales 
accrued salaries  wages and benefits decreased by million primarily due to timing differences in payment of salaries and bonuses and a decrease in headcount as a result of the restructuring actions taken during see note of the notes 
other accrued liabilities decreased by million mainly due to our reversal of estimates for certain accrued liabilities of million that management no longer considered to be necessary see note of the notes 
cash and cash equivalents generated from operating activities 
during  we generated million of net cash and cash equivalents from operating activities compared to million generated in cash and cash equivalents generated from operating activities for the year ended december  were the result of the following income before depreciation and amortization  non cash restructuring and other items  amortization of non cash deferred stock compensation  loss on write down of equity securities  net of gain on sales  gain or loss on repurchase redemption of convertible notes  and gain on the sale of property and equipment 
the non cash items and other non operating adjustments are quantified in our consolidated statements of cash flows included in this current report on form k  offset by a net decrease in assets and liabilities  net of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations including changes in working capital components from december  as compared to december  as discussed above

the fair value of the swaps was formerly included in other non current assets 
cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities 
cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities during were million as compared to million used in the investing activities or changes during were as follows purchases of debt and equity securities available for sale  net of sales and maturities 
purchases of property and equipment 
proceeds from the sale of property and equipment 
acquisition of companies see note of the notes 
during the third quarter of  we entered into two new operating leases for wafer fabrication equipment  replacing two existing operating leases for the same wafer fabrication equipment 
non current assets and deposits decreased as a result of a refund of collateral from the former equipment operating leases and increased as a result of collateral deposited on the new equipment operating leases 
during the fourth quarter of  we exercised our right to buyout or purchase all of the wafer fabrication equipment that had previously been under two operating lease and security agreements see note of the notes 
the early termination or buyout amount was million 
cash collateral of million associated with the leases was returned to us 
termination fees under the lease agreements were not significant 
non current assets and deposits also decreased during as a result of collateral refunded due to the termination of a letter of credit arrangement during the first quarter of and the termination of the lease swap during the third quarter of see note of the notes 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million in in recent years we have reduced our level of capital expenditures as a result of our focus on establishing strategic supplier alliances with 
table of contents foundry semiconductor manufacturers  which enables us to have access to advanced manufacturing capacity  and reduces our capital spending requirements 
cash and cash equivalents used in financing activities 
cash and cash equivalents used in financing activities during were million as compared to million in the financing activities during were as follows the repurchase of a portion of the convertible notes due in  additional purchase of minority interests in our japanese subsidiary  the issuance of common stock under our employee stock option and purchase plans  and the repayment of debt obligations 
it is our policy to reinvest our earnings and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to stockholders in the foreseeable future 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and funds generated from operations will be adequate to meet our operating and capital requirements in the short term 
these resources  combined with funds from financing and our ability to borrow funds  will be adequate to meet our operating and capital requirements and obligations for the foreseeable future 
we may seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on favorable terms 
moreover  any future equity or convertible debt financing will decrease the percentage of equity ownership of existing stockholders and may result in dilution  depending on the price at which the equity is sold or the debt is converted 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period less than after contractual obligations year years years years total in millions convertible subordinated notes operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase commitments total convertible subordinated notes as of december   we have million of convertible notes due in november convertible notes and million of the convertible notes due in may convertible notes 
all of the convertible notes are subordinated to all existing and future senior debt and are convertible at the holder s option  at any time prior to the maturity date of the convertible notes  into shares of our common stock 
the and convertible notes have conversion prices of approximately per share and per share  respectively 
the convertible notes are redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  on at least days notice at any time on or after the call date  which is two years before the due date 
we cannot elect to redeem the convertible notes prior to maturity 
each holder of the and convertible notes has the right to cause us to repurchase all of such holder s convertible notes at of their principal amount plus accrued interest upon the occurrence of any fundamental change  which includes a transaction or event such as an exchange offer  liquidation  tender offer  consolidation  merger or combination 
interest is payable semiannually 

table of contents fluctuations in our stock price impact the prices of our outstanding convertible securities and the likelihood of the convertible securities being converted into cash or equity 
if we are required to redeem any of the convertible notes for cash  it may affect our liquidity position 
in the event they do not convert to equity  we believe that our current cash position and expected future operating cash flows will be adequate to meet these obligations as they mature 
from time to time  we may repurchase or redeem convertible notes 
operating lease obligations we lease real estate  certain non manufacturing equipment and software under non cancelable operating leases 
see note of the notes for a discussion of the two operating leases for manufacturing equipment that were refinanced in the third quarter of and then terminated and bought out during the fourth quarter as of december   there are no future payments under these leases included in the table above 
purchase commitments we maintain certain purchase commitments primarily for raw materials with suppliers and for some non production items 
purchase commitments for inventory materials are generally restricted to a forecasted time horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties 
this forecasted time horizon can vary among different suppliers 
standby letters of credit at december  and  we had outstanding standby letters of credit of million and million  respectively 
these instruments are off balance sheet commitments to extend financial guarantees for leases and certain self insured risks  import export taxes and performance under contracts  and generally have one year terms 
the fair value of the letters of credit approximates the contract amount 
the decline in standby letters of credit as of december  compared to december  reflects the termination and buyout of the two operating leases for manufacturing equipment further discussed in note of the notes 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
note of the notes describes the significant accounting policies essential to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures 
we believe the following to be critical accounting estimates 
they are both important to the portrayal of our company s financial condition and results  and they require significant management judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
as a result of the inherent uncertainty  there is a likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are reasonable  appropriate and correct  actual future results may differ materially from our estimates 
inventory valuation methodology 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
we write down our inventories for estimated obsolescence and unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
inventory impairment charges create a new cost basis for inventory 
we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive delivery performance to our customers with the risk of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  product life cycles  life time buys at the end of supplier product runs and a shift of production to outsourcing 
if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than we project or our customers fail to 
table of contents corporate information proxy statement meet projections  additional inventory write downs may be required 
our inventory balance was approximately million and million as of december   and  respectively 
if market conditions are more favorable than expected  we could experience more favorable gross profit margins going forward as we sell inventory that was previously written down 
see discussion in gross profit margin section earlier in this md a 
valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill 
we operate our own wafer fabrication facilities and make significant capital expenditures to ensure that we are technologically competitive 
in addition  we have actively pursued the acquisition of businesses  which has resulted in significant goodwill and intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  identifiable intangibles and related goodwill annually or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following i significant negative industry or economic trends  ii exiting an activity in conjunction with a restructuring of operations  iii current  historical or projected losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with an asset  or iv a significant decline in our market capitalization  for an extended period of time  relative to net book value 
when we determine that there is an indicator that the carrying value of long lived assets  identifiable intangibles or related goodwill may not be recoverable  we measure impairment based on estimates of future cash flows 
these estimates include assumptions about future conditions such as future revenues  gross margins  operating expenses within our company  the fair values of certain assets based on thoroughly researched management estimates  and industry trends 
see notes and to the notes for more details on long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill 
as of december  we have a goodwill balance of million that is not amortized 
we monitor the recoverability of goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions annually  or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
impairment  if any  would be determined in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles assets  which uses a fair value model for determining the carrying value of goodwill 
as a result of the decline in revenues in the semiconductor industry and the corresponding decline in our outlook as of the latter part of the third quarter of and the conclusion that the gresham manufacturing facility was impaired see note of the notes  we reviewed goodwill by reporting unit for impairment as of september   which was updated as of december  our reporting units are semiconductor and storage systems or engenio 
the impairment testing is a two step process 
the first step requires comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its net book value 
we concluded that goodwill was not impaired under the first step as of september  and december  the second step is only performed if impairment is indicated after the first step is performed  as it involves measuring the actual impairment to goodwill 
our next annual test for the impairment of goodwill will be performed in our fourth fiscal quarter in we use management estimates of future cash flows to perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
these estimates include assumptions about future conditions such as future revenues  gross margins and operating expenses within lsi 
two methodologies were used to obtain the fair value for each reporting unit as of september  discounted cash flow and market multiple 
the discounted cash flow and market multiple methodologies include assumptions about future conditions within our reporting units and related industries 
these assumptions include estimates of future market size and growth  expected trends in technology  timing of new product introductions by our competitors and us  and the nature of the industry in which comparable companies and we operate 
if significant changes to these assumptions occur  goodwill could become impaired in the future 
restructuring reserves 
we have recorded reserves accruals for restructuring costs related to the restructuring of operations 
the restructuring reserves include payments to employees for severance  termination fees associated with leases and other contracts  decommissioning and selling costs associated with assets held for sale  and other costs related to the closure of facilities 
after the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  on january   the reserves have been recorded when management has approved a plan to restructure operations and a liability has been 
table of contents incurred rather than the date upon which management has approved and announced a plan 
the restructuring reserves are based upon management estimates at the time they are recorded 
these estimates can change depending upon changes in facts and circumstances subsequent to the date the original liability was recorded 
for example  existing accruals for severance may be modified if employees are redeployed due to circumstances not foreseen when the original plans were initiated  accruals for outplacement services may not be fully utilized by former employees  and severance accruals could change for statutory reasons in countries outside the united states 
accruals for facility leases under which we ceased using the benefits conveyed to us under the lease may change if market conditions for subleases change or if we later negotiate a termination of the lease 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 restructuring reserves were recorded at the time we announced a plan to exit certain activities and were based on estimates of the costs and length of time to exit those activities 
see note of the notes for a complete discussion of our restructuring actions and all related restructuring reserves by type as of december  see discussion in restructuring of operations and other items  net earlier in this md a for changes in estimates made during  and income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities 
we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
see note of the notes for more details about our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves the application of united states generally accepted accounting principles to complex tax rules and regulations within multiple jurisdictions throughout the world 
our tax liabilities include estimates for all income and related taxes that we believe are probable and that can be reasonably estimated 
to the extent that our estimates are understated  additional charges to income tax expense would be recorded in the period in which we determine such understatement 
if our income tax estimates are overstated  income tax benefits will be recognized when realized 
recent accounting pronouncements the information contained in part ii  item in note of the notes under the heading recent accounting pronouncements is hereby incorporated by reference into this part ii  item item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity 
with the objective of protecting our cash flows and earnings from the impact of fluctuations in interest rates  while minimizing the cost of capital  we may enter into or terminate interest rate swaps 
in june  we entered into interest rate swap transactions the swaps with several investment banks 
the swaps effectively converted fixed interest payments on a portion of our and convertible notes to libor based floating rates 
the swaps qualified for hedge accounting as fair value hedges  with changes in the fair value of the interest rate risk on the convertible notes being offset by changes in the fair values of the swaps recorded as a component of interest expense 
see note of the notes 
in the second quarter of  we terminated swaps with a notional amount of million 
the termination resulted in a deferred gain of million being recorded as a component of the convertible notes and to be amortized as a benefit to interest expense over the remaining term of the hedged convertible notes 
a portion of the deferred gain was written off as part of the net gain or loss on the repurchase redemption of the hedged convertible notes during and as of december   a deferred gain of million remains to be amortized 
in  before termination  the difference between the changes in the fair values of the derivative and the hedged risk resulted in a benefit to interest expense of million 
in may  we entered into an interest rate swap transaction to effectively convert the libor based floating rate interest payments on the equipment operating lease  with an original notional amount of million  to a fixed interest rate lease swap 
an expense of approximately million was recorded to 
table of contents cost of revenues in as the lease payments were made 
in august  the company entered into two new equipment operating leases for the wafer fabrication equipment that was previously on the above mentioned leases 
as a result of entering into the new leases  the hedged forecasted interest payments were no longer probable 
hedge accounting treatment was discontinued prospectively and the balance in accumulated comprehensive income was immediately recorded as a gain of million in restructuring and other items in the statement of operations 
in september  the company terminated the lease swap 
in  an interest rate move of basis points of our weighted average worldwide interest rate on outstanding debt in affecting our fixed and floating rate financial instruments as of december   including investments and debt obligations  would not have had a significant effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year  assuming that the debt and investment balances remain consistent

foreign currency exchange risk 
we have foreign subsidiaries that operate and sell our products in various global markets 
as a result  our cash flows and earnings are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we attempt to limit these exposures through operational strategies and financial market instruments 
we use various hedge instruments  primarily forward contracts with maturities of twelve months or less and currency option contracts  to manage our exposure associated with net asset and liability positions and cash flows denominated in non functional currencies 
we did not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes during and based on our overall currency rate exposures at december   including derivative financial instruments and non functional currency denominated receivables and payables  a near term appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar would not have a significant effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year 
in  a near term appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar would also not have had a significant effect 
equity price risk 
we have investments in available for sale equity securities included in long term assets
