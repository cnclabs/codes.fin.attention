item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
backlog our backlog as of december  was approximately million  compared to approximately million at december  backlog includes orders confirmed with a purchase order for products scheduled to be shipped to customers during the year because orders may be changed and or cancelled  we do not believe that our backlog is necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future period 

table of contents manufacturing and sourcing we currently own and operate two glass tableware manufacturing plants in the united states located in toledo  ohio  and shreveport  louisiana  a glass tableware manufacturing plant in leerdam  the netherlands  and a glass tableware manufacturing plant in marinha grande  portugal 
we own and operate a ceramic dinnerware plant in syracuse  new york  and a plastics plant in dane  wisconsin 
in august  we announced that we were realigning our glass tableware production capacity in order to improve our cost structure 
in mid february  we ceased operations at our glass tableware manufacturing facility in city of industry  california  and realigned production among our other domestic glass tableware manufacturing facilities 
the closure of the city of industry facility and realignment of production will allow us to reduce our overall fixed costs and improve future operational performance 
as mentioned in the growth strategy section  we acquired crisal a glass manufacturing facility in portugal in january in addition  in late  we obtained a business license in the people s republic of china to manufacture glass tableware 
in early  we procured land use rights in china in order to begin construction on a new glass tableware facility  which is expected to begin glass tableware production in early the manufacture of our tableware products involves the use of automated processes and technologies 
much of our glass tableware production machinery was designed by us and has evolved and been continuously refined to incorporate technology advancements 
we believe that our production machinery and equipment continue to be adequate for our needs in the foreseeable future  but continue to invest in equipment to further improve our production efficiency and reduce our cost profile 
our glass tableware products generally are produced using one of two manufacturing methods or  in the case of certain stemware  a combination of such methods 
most of our tumblers  stemware and certain other glass tableware products are produced by forming molten glass in molds with the use of compressed air 
these products are known as blown glass products 
our other glass tableware products and the stems of certain of our stemware are pressware products  which are produced by pressing molten glass into the desired product shape 
in addition  we source glass tableware  primarily from our joint venture  vitrocrisa  located in mexico 
ceramic dinnerware is also produced through the forming of raw materials into the desired product shape and is either manufactured at our syracuse  new york  production facility or imported primarily from china and bangladesh 
all metal flatware and metal holloware are sourced by our world tableware subsidiary  primarily from china 
plastic products are also produced through the molding of raw materials into the desired shape and are manufactured at our dane  wisconsin  production facility or imported primarily from taiwan and china 
to assist in the manufacturing process  we employ a team of engineers whose responsibilities include efforts to improve and upgrade our manufacturing facilities  equipment and processes 
in addition  they provide engineering required to manufacture new products and implement the large number of innovative changes continuously being made to our product designs  sizes and shapes see research and development section 
raw materials our primary raw materials are sand  lime  soda ash  clay  resins and colorants 
historically  these raw materials have been available in adequate supply from multiple sources 
however  for certain raw materials  there may be temporary shortages due to weather or other factors  including disruptions in supply caused by raw material transportation or production delays 
such shortages have not previously had  and are not expected to have  a material adverse effect on our operations in the future 
however  in our supplier of aragonite a glass colorant ceased to operate as a business 
we adjusted our glass making formula accordingly  and we continue to explore alternative glass formulations in order to achieve the best glass color possible 
natural gas is a primary source of energy in most of our production processes  and variability in the price for natural gas has and could continue to have an impact on our profitability 
historically  we have used natural gas hedging contracts to partially mitigate this impact 
in addition  resins are a primary source of raw materials for our subsidiary traex company  and  historically  the price for resins has fluctuated  directly impacting our profitability 
we also experience fluctuations in the cost to deliver raw materials to our facilities  and such changes affect our earnings 

table of contents research and development our core competencies include our engineering excellence and world class manufacturing techniques 
our focus is to increase the quality of our products and enhance the profitability of our business through research and development 
we will continue to invest in strategic research and development projects that will further enhance our ability to compete in our core business 
we employ a team of engineers  in addition to external consultants  to conduct this research and development 
during the last three years  our expenditures on research and development activities related to new and or improved products and processes were million in  million in  and million in these costs were expensed as incurred 
patents  trademarks and licenses based upon market research and surveys  we believe our trade names and trademarks as well as our product shapes and styles enjoy a high degree of consumer recognition and are valuable assets 
we believe that the libbey  syracuse china  world tableware  royal leerdam  crisal and traex trade names and trademarks are material to our business 
we have rights under a number of patents that relate to a variety of products and processes 
however  we do not consider that any patent or group of patents relating to a particular product or process is of material importance to our business as a whole 
competitors our business is highly competitive  with the principal competitive factors being customer service  brand name  product quality  new product development  delivery time and price 
glass tableware in recent years  we have experienced increased competition from foreign glass tableware manufacturers  particularly from france  indonesia  turkey and the people s republic of china 
in addition  other materials  such as plastics  also compete with glassware 
competitors in glass tableware include among others arc international a private french company  which manufactures and distributes glass tableware worldwide 
indiana glass company a unit of lancaster colony corporation  which manufactures in the us and sells glassware 
oneida ltd  which sources glass tableware from foreign and domestic manufacturers 
anchor hocking a unit of global home products  which manufactures and distributes glass beverageware  industrial products and bakeware to retail  foodservice and industrial markets in the us pasabahce a unit of sisecam  which manufactures glass tableware in various sites throughout the world and sells to retail and foodservice customers in europe  the us and around the world 
bormioli rocco group  which manufactures glass tableware in europe  where the majority of their sales are to retail and foodservice customers 
ceramic dinnerware competitors in us ceramic dinnerware include  among others homer laughlin oneida ltd 
steelite other sourcing companies 
table of contents metalware competitors in metalware include  among others oneida ltd 
walco  inc other sourcing companies plastic products competitors in plastic products are  among others cambro manufacturing company carlisle companies incorporated environmental matters our operations  in common with those of industry generally  are subject to numerous existing laws and governmental regulations designed to protect the environment  particularly regarding plant wastes and emissions and solid waste disposal 
we also may be subject to proposed laws and governmental regulations as they become finalized 
we have shipped  and continue to ship  waste materials for off site disposal 
however  we are not named as a potentially responsible party with respect to any waste disposal site matters pending prior to june   the date of libbey s initial public offering and separation from owens illinois  inc owens illinois 
owens illinois has been named as a potentially responsible party or other participant in connection with certain waste disposal sites to which we also may have shipped wastes prior to june  we may bear some responsibility in connection with those shipments 
pursuant to an indemnification agreement between owens illinois and libbey  owens illinois has agreed to defend and hold us harmless against any costs or liabilities we may incur in connection with any such matters identified and pending as of june   and to indemnify us for any liability that results from these matters in excess of million 
we believe that if it is necessary to draw upon this indemnification  collection is probable 
pursuant to the indemnification agreement referred to above  owens illinois is defending us with respect to the king road landfill 
in january  the board of commissioners of lucas county  ohio instituted a lawsuit against owens illinois  libbey and numerous other defendants 
fifty nine companies were named in the complaint as potentially responsible parties 
in the lawsuit  which was filed in the united states district court for the northern district of ohio  the board of commissioners sought to recover contribution for past and future costs incurred by the county in response to the release or threatened release of hazardous substances at the king road landfill formerly operated and closed by the county 
the board of commissioners dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice in october at the time of the dismissal  the parties to the lawsuit anticipated that the board of commissioners would refile the lawsuit after obtaining more information as to the appropriate environmental remedy 
as of this date  it does not appear that refiling of the lawsuit is imminent 
in view of the uncertainty as to refiling of the suit  the numerous defenses that may be available against the county on the merits of its claim for contribution  the uncertainty as to the environmental remedy  and the uncertainty as to the number of potentially responsible parties  it currently is not possible to quantify any exposure that libbey may have with respect to the king road landfill 
subsequent to june   we have been named a potentially responsible party at four other sites 
in each case  the claims have been settled for immaterial amounts 
we do not anticipate that we will be required to pay any further sums with respect to these sites unless unusual and unanticipated contingencies occur 
on october   syracuse china company  our wholly owned subsidiary  acquired from the pfaltzgraff co 
and certain of its subsidiary corporations  the assets operated by them as syracuse china 
the pfaltzgraff co 
and the new york state department of environmental conservation dec entered into an order on consent effective november   that requires pfaltzgraff to prepare a remedial investigation and feasibility study ri fs to develop a remedial action plan for the site which includes among other items a landfill and wastewater and sludge ponds and adjacent wetlands located on the property purchased by syracuse china company and to remediate the site 
although syracuse china company was not a party to the order on consent  as part of the asset purchase agreement syracuse china company agreed to share a part of the remediation and related expense up to the lesser of of such costs or  construction of the approved remedy began in and was substantially completed in accordingly  syracuse china company s obligation with respect to the associated costs has been satisfied 

table of contents in addition  syracuse china company has been named as a potentially responsible party by reason of its potential ownership of certain property that adjoins its plant and has been designated a sub site of a superfund site 
we believe that any contamination of the sub site was caused by and will be remediated by other parties at no cost to syracuse china company 
those other parties have acquired ownership of the sub site  and their acquisition of the sub site should end any responsibility of syracuse china with respect to the sub site 
we believe that  even if syracuse china company were deemed to be responsible for any expense in connection with the contamination of the sub site  it is likely the expense will be shared with pfaltzgraff pursuant to the asset purchase agreement 
in connection with the closure of our city of industry  california  glassware manufacturing facility  on december   we sold the property on which the facility is located to an entity affiliated with sares regis group  a large real estate development and investment firm 
pursuant to the purchase agreement  the buyer has leased the property back to us in order to enable us to cease operations  to relocate equipment to our other glassware manufacturing facilities  to demolish the improvements on the property and to remediate certain environmental conditions affecting the property 
prior to entering into the purchase agreement  libbey and the buyer performed a significant amount of environmental testing  the results of which indicated that site remediation may need to occur for purposes of satisfying the contract 
during the course of demolition  additional environmental testing will be performed  and we will be required to remediate any additional environmental contamination discovered during the process 
we anticipate that all demolition and required remediation will be completed on or before december  we have agreed to indemnify the buyer for hazardous substances located on  in or under  or migrating from  the property prior to the date on which we complete the demolition and remediation and turn the property over to the buyer for redevelopment 
we regularly review the facts and circumstances of the various environmental matters affecting us  including those covered by indemnification 
although not free of uncertainties  we believe that our share of the remediation costs at the various sites  based upon the number of parties involved at the sites and the estimated cost of undisputed work necessary for remediation based upon known technology and the experience of others  will not be material to us 
there can be no assurance  however  that our future expenditures in such regard will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in addition  occasionally the federal government and various state authorities have investigated possible health issues that may arise from the use of lead or other ingredients in enamels such as those used by us on the exterior surface of our decorated products 
in that connection  libbey glass inc and numerous other glass tableware manufacturers  distributors and importers entered into a consent judgment on august  in connection with an action  leeman v 
arc international north america  inc et al  case no 
cgc superior court of california  san francisco county  brought under california s so called proposition proposition requires businesses with ten or more employees to give a clear and reasonable warning prior to exposing any person to a detectable amount of a chemical listed by the state as covered by this statute 
lead is one of the chemicals covered by that statute 
pursuant to the consent judgment  libbey glass inc and the other defendants including anchor hocking and arc international north america  inc agreed  over a period of time  to reformulate the enamels used to decorate the external surface of certain glass tableware items to reduce the lead content of those enamels 
capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment for environmental control activities were not material during we believe that we are in material compliance with all federal  state and local environmental laws  and we are not aware of any regulatory initiatives that are expected to have a material effect on our products or operations 
employees our employees are vital to our success and our vision to be world class  second to none 
we strive to achieve this through our values of teamwork  change  performance  respect and development 
we employed approximately  persons at december  the majority of our glass tableware employees are us based hourly paid employees covered by six collective bargaining agreements

for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three years  the following should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes 
overview libbey is the leading supplier of tableware products in the us and canada  in addition to supplying to other key export markets 
established in  we are the largest manufacturing  distribution and service network among north american glass tableware manufacturers

we are a joint venture partner in vitrocrisa holding  s 
de rl de rl and related companies vitrocrisa  the largest glass tableware manufacturer in latin america 
was a challenging year from a consolidated net income standpoint  however  we undertook several key strategic projects that will enhance our long term financial performance 
these key initiatives were as follows in august  we announced the realignment of our domestic glass tableware production capacity to allow us to reduce our overall fixed costs and improve future operational performance 
this realignment resulted in the closure of our city of industry  california glass tableware manufacturing facility in mid february and realignment of production to our other domestic glass tableware facilities 
during  we incurred a million pretax charge  and we expect to incur an additional million in  for the closing of the city of industry facility and realignment of our glass tableware production 
the closure of this facility is expected to add to million to annual income from operations  starting in the second quarter of 
table of contents in connection with the closure of our city of industry  california glass tableware facility  we sold approximately acres of land for million net of selling costs in december  subject to the performance of certain site preparation costs 
these cash proceeds were used to pay down outstanding debt in in january  we acquired percent of the shares of crisal cristalaria autom tica sa crisal located in marinha grande  portugal 
crisal manufactures and markets glass tableware  mainly tumblers  stemware and glassware accessories 
royal leerdam  acquired in  and crisal are complementary and key to our growth strategy to supply high quality  machine made glass tableware products to key markets worldwide 
in late  we obtained a business license in the people s republic of china to manufacture glass tableware and in early  we procured land use rights in the people s republic of china with respect to property on which we plan to build a new glass tableware manufacturing facility 
this facility will be a wholly owned factory aimed at the growing chinese and asia pacific markets and other key export markets 
currently  glass tableware production is scheduled to begin in early in june  we entered into a new  unsecured revolving credit agreement for million for a five year term 
this will allow us to continue to finance our operational and acquisition requirements 
during the fourth quarter of  we reduced our inventories by million as we achieved an aggressive plan for inventory reduction 
in  we plan continued inventory reduction 
during  our us based hourly paid employee collective bargaining agreements at our manufacturing plants in toledo  ohio  and shreveport  louisiana  expired  but we successfully negotiated new agreements 
the new agreements with respect to our toledo plant are for a three year term and the new agreement with respect to our shreveport plant is for a four year term 
our capital spending in set a record for the company at million  as we initiated our plan to focus on improved inspection techniques and enhanced robotic applications in our glass factories 
during  we expect to make approximately to million in capital expenditures  excluding expenditures related to the construction of our chinese factory 
we have complied with the internal control requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of as they relate to the company s fiscal year 
although we historically have placed significant emphasis on controls  we made a significant commitment of internal and external resources in order to comply with section as we enter  we are well positioned to comply with these requirements on an ongoing basis

table of contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the areas described below are affected by critical accounting estimates and are impacted significantly by judgments and assumptions in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these critical accounting estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable balance  net of allowances for doubtful accounts  was million in  compared to million in the allowance for doubtful accounts was million in  compared to million in the allowance for doubtful accounts is established through charges to the provision for bad debts 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical trends in collections and write offs  our judgment as to the probability of collecting accounts and our evaluation of business risk 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates that are susceptible to revision as more information becomes available 
accounts are determined to be uncollectible when the debt is deemed to be worthless or only recoverable in part and are written off at that time through a charge against the allowance 
allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventory we identify slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimate appropriate allowance provisions accordingly 
we provide inventory allowances based upon excess and obsolete inventories driven primarily from future demand forecasts 
historically  these loss provisions have not been significant  as the majority of our inventories are valued using the last in  first out lifo method 
at december   our inventories were million  with loss provisions of million  compared to inventories of million and loss provisions of million at december  the allowance increase in compared to is mainly attributable to the allowance that we established for inventories related to the low margin business that we elected to exit due to the realignment of our glass tableware manufacturing capacity 
asset impairment investments we review our investment in vitrocrisa if indicators of impairment arise 
to the extent that the analysis is performed  the analysis is based upon the discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of our investment 
the fair value is then compared to the carrying amount of our investment 
to the extent the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no impairment exists 
for all periods presented  no impairment existed 
fixed assets we review fixed assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
determining whether impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions 
due to the closure of our facility in city of industry  california  we wrote down the values of certain assets based upon appraisals performed by an independent third party 
these write downs occurred in and are further disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets goodwill impairment tests are completed for each reporting unit on an annual basis  or more frequently in certain circumstances where impairment indicators arise 
when performing our test for impairment  we use the discounted cash flow method to compute the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value is then compared to the carrying value 
to the extent that fair value exceeds the carrying value  no impairment exists 
this was done as of october st for each year presented  and there was no goodwill impairment indicated 
individual indefinite life intangible assets are also evaluated for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently in certain circumstances where impairment indicators arise 
when performing our test for impairment  we use the discounted cash flow method to compute the fair value  which is then compared to the carrying value of the indefinite life intangible asset 
to the extent that fair value exceeds the carrying value  no impairment exists 
this was done as of october st for each year presented  and there was no impairment indicated 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue is recognized when products are shipped and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer 
revenue is recorded net of returns  discounts and sales incentive programs offered to customers 
our various incentive programs are offered to a broad base of customers and we record accruals for these as sales occur 
these programs typically offer incentives for purchase activities by customers that include growth objectives 
criteria for payment include the achievement by customers of certain purchase targets and the purchase by customers of particular product types 
management regularly reviews the adequacy of the accruals based on current customer purchases  targeted purchases and payout levels 
self insurance reserves we use self insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities related to workers compensation and employee health care benefits that are not covered by third party insurance 
workers compensation accruals are recorded at the estimated ultimate payout amounts received from our third party administrator based on individual case estimates 
in addition  we record estimates of incurred but not reported losses developed from past experience 
group health accruals include estimates of incurred but not reported estimates received from our third party administrator of the plan 
pension assumptions the following are the assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and pretax income effect for our pension plan benefits for  and us plans us plans year ended december  discount rate expected long term rate of return on plan assets rate of compensation increase to to we account for our defined benefit pension plans on an expense basis that reflects actuarial funding methods 
two critical assumptions  discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets  are important elements of plan expense and asset liability measurement 
we evaluate these critical assumptions on our annual measurement date of december st 
other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age  mortality and turnover are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our experience 
actual results in any given year often will differ from actuarial assumptions because of demographic  economic and other factors 
the discount rate enables us to estimate the present value of expected future cash flows on the measurement date 
we use the yield on high quality fixed income investments at our december st measurement date 
the discount rate at december st is used to measure the year end benefit obligations and the earnings effects for the subsequent year 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
to reflect market interest rate conditions  we reduced our discount rate for our us plans and for our non us plans at december  to determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets 
we reduced our expected long term rate of return for our us plans at december  we made no change to the expected long term rate of return for our non us plans at december  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets at december st is used to measure the earnings effects for the subsequent year 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets that recognizes gains and losses in the fair value of plan assets compared to expected returns over the next five years 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension expense income 
the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized over five years 
the net deferral of past asset gains losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension expense income 
sensitivity to changes in key assumptions is as follows 
table of contents a change of 
in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would change total pension expense by approximately million based on year end data 
a change of 
in the discount rate would change our total pension expense by approximately million 
nonpension postretirement assumptions we use various actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and the expected trend in health care costs  to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for our retiree health plan 
we use the yield on high quality fixed income investments at our december st measurement date to establish the discount rate 
the discount rate at december st is used to measure the year end benefit obligations and the earnings effects for the subsequent year 
the following are the actuarial assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and pretax income effect for our nonpension postretirement benefits us plans us plans year ended december  discount rate initial health care trend ultimate health care trend years to reach ultimate trend rate sensitivity to changes in key assumptions is as follows a change of 
in the discount rate would change nonpension postretirement expense by million 
a change of 
in health care trend rates would not have a material impact upon the nonpension postretirement expense 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the us and certain foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
these reserves are established when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit and the expiration of a statute of limitation 
american jobs creation act of in october  the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law 
the act creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate earnings from foreign subsidiaries by providing an dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controller foreign corporations to the extent the dividends exceed a base amount and are invested in the united states pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan 
this temporary incentive is available to the company in the deduction is subject to a number of limitations and uncertainty remains as to the interpretation of numerous provisions in the act 
the us treasury department is in the process of providing clarifying guidance on key elements of the repatriation provision  and congress may reintroduce legislation that provides for certain technical corrections to the act 
we have not completed our evaluation of the repatriation provision due to the uncertainty associated with the interpretation of the provision  as well as numerous tax  legal  treasury and business considerations 
we expect to complete our evaluation of the potential dividends we may pursue  if any  and the related tax ramifications after additional guidance is issued 
new accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no

fsp supersedes fas no 
fsp is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  fsp provides authoritative guidance on the accounting for the act and specifies the disclosure requirements for employers who have adopted fsp our net postretirement benefit costs do not reflect the effects of the act because it is currently not expected to be a significant event for the plan 
as regulations are clarified and marketplace factors emerge  the postretirement benefit cost could result in a change in the future

table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk currency we are exposed to market risks due to changes in currency values  although the majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in the us dollar 
the currency market risks include devaluations and other major currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar  euro or mexican peso that could reduce the cost competitiveness of our products or those of vitrocrisa compared to foreign competition and the impact of exchange rate changes in the mexican peso relative to the us dollar on the earnings of vitrocrisa expressed under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
interest rates we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates in the us and have entered into interest rate protection agreements rate agreements with respect to million of debt as a means to manage our exposure to fluctuating interest rates 
the rate agreements effectively convert a portion of our long term borrowings from variable rate debt to fixed rate debt  thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future income 
the average fixed rate of interest for our borrowings related to the rate agreements at december   excluding applicable fees  is per year  and the total interest rate  including applicable fees  is per year 
the average maturity of these rate agreements is year at december  debt not covered by the rate agreements has fluctuating interest rates with a weighted average rate of per year at december  we had million of debt subject to fluctuating interest rates at december  a change of one percentage point in such rates would result in a change in interest expense of approximately million on an annual basis 
if the counterparties to these rate agreements were to fail to perform  we would no longer be protected from interest rate fluctuations by these rate agreements 
however  we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparts 
natural gas we are also exposed to market risks associated with changes in the price of natural gas 
we use commodity futures contracts related to forecasted future natural gas requirements of our domestic manufacturing operations 
the objective of these futures contracts is to limit the fluctuations in prices paid and potential losses in earnings or cash flows from adverse price movements in the underlying natural gas commodity 
we consider our forecasted natural gas requirements of our domestic manufacturing operations in determining the quantity of natural gas to hedge 
we combine the forecasts with historical observations to establish the percentage of forecast eligible to be hedged  typically ranging from to of our anticipated requirements  generally twelve to eighteen months in the future 
for our natural gas requirements that are not hedged  we are subject to changes in the price of natural gas  which affects our earnings 
pension we are exposed to market risks associated with changes in the various capital markets 
changes in long term interest rates affect the discount rate that is used to measure our pension benefit obligations and related pension expense 
changes in the equity and debt securities markets affect the performance of our pension plan asset performance and related pension expense 
sensitivity to these key market risks factors is as follows a change of 
in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would change total pension expense by approximately million based on year end data 
a change of 
in the discount rate would change our total pension expense by approximately million
