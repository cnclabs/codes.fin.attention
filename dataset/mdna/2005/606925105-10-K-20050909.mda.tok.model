excluding this charge  operating loss was million  or of revenues 
net income was million  or per diluted share  in fiscal and million  or per diluted share  in fiscal  as compared with a net loss of million  or per share in fiscal we derive our revenues from product licenses  related annual maintenance and professional services and other 
this year  of total revenues were generated from software licenses  were generated from maintenance and were generated from professional services and other sources 
software license revenues increased from million in fiscal to million last year  and decreased to million this year 
software license revenues this year included an individual contract for million in software license fees with a major financial institution 
we believe that our results in fiscal were negatively impacted by several factors  including underperformance due to poor execution in a closing contracts for existing products  b order pipeline building for new and existing products and c new product integration 
in addition  performance was impacted by health related senior management changes in the sales and marketing functions 
during fiscal  we began to make changes to our business that we believe will address these matters and improve our performance  including  but not limited to  personnel transfers  separating the management of sales and marketing functions to drive more focus in each area  and reallocating resources in the development organization to speed the integration of our newer products with existing products  while maintaining our high quality standards 
specifically  during the fiscal third quarter of  our vice president of product engineering began to focus on future product architecture  and we created two new positions  vice president of product development and vice president of customer satisfaction and quality assurance  both reporting directly to our president and chief executive officer 
in the fiscal third quarter of  we announced the appointment of a new senior vice president of marketing  and in the fiscal fourth quarter  we announced the appointment of a new senior vice president of worldwide sales 
although it will take some time to experience the full impact of these changes  we have seen some positive signs  including sequential revenue growth in the last three quarters of fiscal maintenance revenues increased from million in fiscal to million last year to million this year 
maintenance revenue consists primarily of fees for customer support services and enhancements we provide for our products 
the increases in maintenance revenues during these years were primarily due to an increase in new licensed software covered by maintenance agreements and increased maintenance fees on renewals  which were partially offset by non renewal of existing maintenance contracts and lower maintenance rates on solution packs 
non renewals are the result of a number of factors  including the consolidation of our customer base  the consolidation of customer data centers  the scaling back of obsolete customer operating systems and the migration of our customers to solution packs 
prior to the latter part of fiscal  we charged primarily of contract value for server product annual maintenance and between and of contract value for client product annual maintenance  with a significant portion of the maintenance contracts covering server products 
beginning in the latter part of fiscal  annual maintenance for new year enterprise licenses for server and client products is generally based on of the contract value 
annual maintenance for solution packs  which comprised a significant portion of license revenues in fiscal  and to a lesser degree during fiscal  is generally based on of contract value 
solution packs are combinations of certain server and client products designed to address specific customer requirements  which generally have five year license terms 
professional service and other revenue decreased from million in fiscal to million last year and increased to million this year 
our professional services group offers installation and conversion services and  to a lesser extent  business consulting and training to our customers 
a large percentage of our suite of products are generally not difficult to install and do not require significant installation services 
as such  while this line of our business provides a valuable service to our customers  revenues from professional services are not a significant percentage of overall revenue 
the increase in revenues during fiscal reflects several large contracts that closed during the second half of this year 
international revenues increased from million in fiscal to million last year to million this year 
the majority of our current international revenues are derived from the direct sales force of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries also derive revenue in certain geographies through third party agents 
our subsidiaries conduct business in the currency of the country in which they operate  exposing us to currency fluctuations and currency transaction losses or gains  which are outside of our control 
we believe that the content management markets in which we operate will experience growth in the near term and that our newer products will provide additional opportunities for growth 
we believe that our products can help our customers solve their challenges meeting regulatory compliance requirements  reducing the cost and increasing the efficiency of paper based processes and gaining control of intellectual assets in the form of unstructured content to increase productivity 
however  we believe market factors are driving customers to cautiously spend on enterprise software  which can result in unpredictability in the timing of orders 
additionally  the sales cycle is long and involves complexity as customers consider a number of factors before committing to purchase enterprise software 
factors considered by customers include product benefits including its ability to meet various regulatory compliance requirements  cost  time of implementation  return on investment  the ability to operate with existing and future computer systems  the ability to accommodate increased transaction volume and product reliability 
there are no assurances that the growth in the overall content management market or the success of our newer products  such as workflowdirect tm  viewdirect e mail management  viewdirect contenuity  viewdirect r total content integrator and viewdirect abs  will develop as anticipated or that the changes we made to improve our execution in closing contracts  building order pipeline and new product integration will be successful 
we will be adopting the provisions of the financial accounting standards board s statement no 
r in the first quarter of fiscal  which will require us to record stock based employee compensation expense in the income statement rather than as footnote disclosure 
on june   our board of directors approved a plan to accelerate the vesting of all unvested employee stock options  other than those options awarded to officers 
our board took this action with the belief that it is in the best interest of stockholders  as it will reduce our reported compensation expense associated with these stock options in future periods 
as a result of this acceleration  during the fiscal fourth quarter of  we recorded a pre tax charge of  of compensation expense 
we are currently evaluating option valuation methodologies  assumptions  method of adoption and other considerations in light of sfas no 
r 
we anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
r will negatively impact our results of operations for fiscal the issuance of new employee stock options  if any  would increase the negative impact of sfas no 
r 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates are evaluated on an on going basis 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes that its significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are influenced by the following critical accounting policies revenue recognition we recognize license and maintenance revenue in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
we generate license revenues from licensing the rights to use our software products to our customers 
we also generate maintenance revenues from renewable support and software enhancements and professional service revenues from performing consulting activities performed for license customers 
software license contracts generally have terms of three  five or years 
revenues from software license agreements are recognized upon delivery of the software if evidence of an arrangement exists  pricing is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
if an acceptance period is required  revenues are recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period 
we allocate revenue on software arrangements involving multiple elements to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value allocable to each element 
historically  our contracts included a software license and an obligation to provide maintenance 
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria were met  revenue was recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop  whereby the fair value of the undelivered elements was deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee was recognized as revenue 
accordingly  when we entered into a contract that included both a software license and an obligation to provide maintenance  the maintenance revenue was unbundled from the initial license fee and recognized ratably over the maintenance period  starting from the inception of the software license agreement 
we determined the portion of the contract price attributable to maintenance which did not necessarily track the allocation between license and maintenance fees set out in the contract using a percentage derived from our pricing structure 
the unbundled portion of such maintenance revenue was classified as deferred revenue  with amounts extending beyond one year reported as non current deferred revenue 
if evidence of the fair value for undelivered elements did not exist  all revenue from the arrangement was deferred until such evidence materialized or until all elements were delivered 
beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  the vast majority of the company s software license revenue contracts provide for optional maintenance in the first year  billed separately from the software license arrangement 
maintenance revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the support  typically months 
the unearned portion of maintenance revenue is classified as deferred revenue 
we offer installment contracts to our customers  which provide for periodic payments generally over three to five years 
under such contracts  software license revenue reflects the present value of future payments under non cancelable license arrangements 
the discount is recognized as interest income over the term of the arrangement 
we have an established business practice of offering installment contracts to customers and have a history of successfully enforcing original payment terms on these contracts without making concessions 
in addition  the payment obligations are unrelated to product implementation or any other post transaction activity  therefore  revenues from installment contracts are generally recognized in the same manner as those requiring current payment 
we entered into an arrangement during our fiscal first quarter of that provides us with the option of selling installments receivable to general electric capital corporation 
this arrangement gives us enhanced flexibility in offering financing alternatives to our customers and in managing our cash flows 
professional service revenue is generally recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
in accordance with this method  revenue from professional service contracts is recognized based on the percentage of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs of the project 
the financial reporting for these contracts depends on estimates  which are regularly assessed and subject to revision as the contract progresses to completion 
when the current estimate of total contract costs indicates that a contract will result in a loss  a provision for the full loss is recognized 
professional service revenue associated with new products is generally deferred until completion of the project and acceptance by the customer 
software development costs statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  requires that certain software development costs be capitalized once technological feasibility is established 
the capitalized costs are then amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated product life  or on the ratio of current revenues to total projected product revenues  whichever is greater 
we determine technological feasibility based on the working model method 
the period between establishment of a working model and the general availability of our software has historically been short 
accordingly  software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant 
as a result  we have expensed all software development costs 
income taxes we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires the use of the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities  and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards  and tax credit carryforwards if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized 
a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statement of operations as a percentage of total revenues for the fiscal years indicated years ended june  revenues software license maintenance professional service and other total revenues cost of revenues software license maintenance professional service and other total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative acquired in process research and development facilities restructuring total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income  net other income expense income loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss year ended june  compared to year ended june  compared to year ended june  revenues o total revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and decreased to million in fiscal domestic revenues decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and decreased to million in fiscal international revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased to million in fiscal approximately of the million increase in international revenues in fiscal was a result of the change in the exchange rates from fiscal  while the impact of the change in exchange rates this year was minimal 
we believe that the increase in international revenues in fiscal and reflect the change made in local management and the continued investment internationally 
included in international revenues during fiscal was an individual contract for million in software license fees with a major financial institution 
the following provides a discussion of the changes in software license revenues  maintenance revenues and professional service and other revenues for the fiscal years ended june   and o software license revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and decreased to million in fiscal license revenues increased in fiscal primarily due to increased licensing of our products by existing customers and  to a lesser extent  by new customers  as well as a nominal improvement in the overall economy and the success of our solution packs 
during the latter part of fiscal  we began to market licenses of viewdirect tcm products under the term solution packs 
solution packs are combinations of certain server and client products designed to address specific customer applications and requirements with  generally  license terms of five years 
software license revenues from solution packs represented almost and of total license revenues during fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease was partially due to the fact that software license revenues this year included an individual contract for million in software license fees with a major financial institution  which was not a solution pack 
we believe that our results in fiscal were negatively impacted by several factors  including underperformance due to poor execution in a closing contracts for existing products  b order pipeline building for new and existing products and c new product integration 
in addition  performance was impacted by health related senior management changes in the sales and marketing functions 
during fiscal  we began to make changes to our business that we believe will address these matters and improve our performance  including  but not limited to  personnel transfers  separating the management of sales and marketing functions to drive more focus in each area  and reallocating resources in the development organization to speed the integration of our newer products with existing products  while maintaining our high quality standards 
specifically  during the fiscal third quarter of  our vice president of product engineering began to focus on future product architecture  and we created two new positions  vice president of product development and vice president of customer satisfaction and quality assurance  both reporting directly to our president and chief executive officer 
in the fiscal third quarter of  we announced the appointment of a new senior vice president of marketing  and in the fiscal fourth quarter  we announced the appointment of a new senior vice president of worldwide sales 
although it will take some time to experience the full impact of these changes  we have seen some positive signs  including sequential revenue growth in the last three quarters of fiscal we had approximately million of software license contracts signed by customers at june  that did not meet all of the requirements for revenue recognition in the fiscal fourth quarter of we will record these contracts as revenue in the fiscal first quarter of we also had approximately  of contracts signed by customers at june  that did not meet all of the requirements for revenue recognition in the fiscal fourth quarter of this revenue was recognized in the fiscal first quarter of o maintenance revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased to million in fiscal the increases in maintenance revenues during these years were primarily due to an increase in new licensed software covered by maintenance agreements and increased maintenance fees on renewals  which were partially offset by non renewal of existing maintenance contracts and lower maintenance rates on solution packs 
non renewals are the result of a number of factors  including the consolidation of our customer base  the consolidation of customer data centers  the scaling back of obsolete customer operating systems and the migration of our customers to solution packs 
prior to the latter part of fiscal  we charged primarily of contract value for server product annual maintenance and between and of contract value for client product annual maintenance  with a significant portion of the maintenance contracts covering server products 
beginning in the latter part of fiscal  annual maintenance for new year enterprise licenses for server and client products is generally based on of the contract value 
annual maintenance for solution packs  which comprised a significant portion of license revenues in fiscal  and to a lesser degree during fiscal  is generally based on of contract value 
solution packs are combinations of certain server and client products designed to address specific customer requirements  which generally have five year license terms 
o professional service and other revenues decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased to million in fiscal professional service revenues for fiscal included approximately  relating to services associated with new products that we had deferred revenue recognition pending acceptance by the customer 
excluding this amount  professional service revenues decreased almost in fiscal the decrease in revenues during fiscal reflects fewer large professional service engagements 
excluding the  item mentioned above  professional service revenues increased during fiscal  reflecting several large contracts that closed during the second half of this fiscal year 
our professional services group offers installation and conversion services  and to a lesser extent  business consulting and training to our customers 
a large percentage of the mobius suite of products are generally not difficult to install and do not require significant installation services 
as such  while this line of our business provides a valuable service to our customers  revenues from professional services are not a significant percentage of overall revenue 
other revenues for all years were not significant 
cost of revenues o cost of software license revenues consists primarily of the cost of royalties and sublicense fees 
the cost of software license revenues were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and increased to million in fiscal  representing  and  respectively  of software license revenues in those years 
the cost of software license revenues is a variable expense related to software license revenues that are subject to third party royalties and sub license fees 
the slight decrease during fiscal is due primarily to a decrease in license revenues for products to which we pay royalties 
the increase during fiscal is primarily due to higher royalties related to software license revenues that were subject to third party royalties  in particular  a significant imaging solution licensed to a customer that included third party software during the fiscal third quarter of o cost of maintenance revenues consists primarily of personnel costs related to our customer support group  and to a lesser extent  royalties on third party products 
the cost of maintenance revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased to million in fiscal  representing  and  respectively  of maintenance revenues in those years 
in fiscal  the increase in cost of maintenance revenues is primarily attributable to increased staffing and personnel related costs 
this increase was partially offset by the increased utilization of customer support personnel in research and development projects and the classification of the related costs as research and development expense 
in fiscal  the increase in cost of maintenance revenues is primarily due to personnel related costs resulting from increased staffing  as well as increased utilization of professional services personnel in customer support projects  resulting in a higher allocation of these costs to cost of maintenance revenues 
o cost of professional service and other revenues consists primarily of personnel costs associated with providing professional services 
the cost of professional service and other revenues decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and decreased to million in fiscal  representing  and respectively  of professional service and other revenues in those years 
the cost of professional service for fiscal included approximately  of costs relating to services associated with new products that we had deferred pending acceptance by the customer 
in fiscal  excluding this amount  the cost of professional service decreased  primarily due to a decrease in third party vendor costs 
in fiscal  the cost of professional service decreased  excluding the  item mentioned above 
the cost of professional service decreased due to lower personnel costs reflecting decreased headcount  as well as the allocation of some of the personnel costs to cost of maintenance revenues due to the utilization of professional services personnel in customer support projects 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in third party subcontractor costs 
operating expenses o sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of the cost of personnel associated with the selling and marketing of our products  including salaries  incentive compensation costs  travel and entertainment costs and bad debt expense 
sales and marketing costs also include the cost of branch sales offices  marketing  promotional materials and advertising 
these expenses increased slightly from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased to million for fiscal  representing  and  respectively  of total revenues in those years 
in fiscal  sales and marketing expenses increased slightly due to higher personnel costs reflecting increased headcount  offset by lower depreciation costs  bad debt expense and savings due to modifications in our incentive compensation plan 
in fiscal  sales and marketing expenses increased due to higher personnel costs reflecting increased average headcount and severance expense  travel expenses and payroll taxes and benefits due to higher mix of revenue and incentive compensation earned by employees in countries with higher social costs 
these increases were partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs earned on lower total software license revenues 
we intend to continue to invest in our sales and marketing capabilities to drive future revenues 
o research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs attributable to the development of new software products and the enhancement of existing products 
we employ developers in rye  ny  orlando  fl  and ottawa  canada  and utilize subcontractors in india and the ukraine 
research and development expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased to million for fiscal  representing  and  respectively  of total revenues in those years 
the increase in fiscal is primarily attributable to higher headcount and related costs associated with continued development of products  additional quality control resources and personnel added with the acquisition on october  of the contenuity software and certain other assets of cytura corp 
cytura 
for a further discussion of the acquisition of the contenuity software and certain other assets of cytura  see the section entitled  liquidity and capital resources below 
the increase in fiscal is primarily due to higher personnel costs on increased headcount  including personnel added as a result of the acquisition on april  of the technology and certain other assets of emanage inc emanage and increased depreciation and amortization primarily related to intangible assets recorded in connection with the emanage asset acquisition 
for a further discussion of the acquisition of the technology and certain other assets of emanage  see the section entitled  liquidity and capital resources below 
we intend to continue to invest in our research and development activities to generate new products to bring to the marketplace and to make enhancements to existing products 
o general and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs related to management  accounting  human resources  information technology services  administration and associated overhead costs  as well as fees for professional services  primarily legal and accounting 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased to million in fiscal  representing  and  respectively  of total revenues in those years 
the increase in fiscal is primarily attributable to higher personnel costs and professional fees primarily due to the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of  offset by lower depreciation 
the increase in is due to higher personnel costs  primarily as a result of increased headcount and salary increases  and increased subcontractor and accounting fees related to sarbanes oxley compliance work 
o acquired in process research and development expenses relate to the acquisition of the contenuity software and certain other assets of cytura and the technology and certain other assets of emanage 
a portion of the purchase price in each acquisition was allocated to acquired in process research and technology 
since the technological feasibility of the research and development projects had not yet been achieved and we believed such projects had no alternative future use  the acquired in process research and development was expensed in the year of acquisition 
as a result  we recorded a charge of  in fiscal relating to the cytura asset acquisition and  in fiscal relating to the emanage asset acquisition 
valuations prepared using the discounted net cash flow method were utilized to value the acquired in process research and development expenses for both acquisitions 
o facilities restructuring expenses of  in fiscal consisted of an accrual for a loss on our leases for two of our sales offices 
in connection with management s plan to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies  we recorded a facilities restructuring charge of million in fiscal relating to the first sales office 
the charge reflected estimated future lease obligations  net of estimated sublease income  for office space we will no longer utilize 
we worked with an external real estate consultant to determine the best estimate for the accrual 
during fiscal  we entered into an agreement with the landlord and the over tenant which released us from all of our ongoing obligations under the original terms of the lease effective as of february  accordingly  we recorded additional expenses of  in fiscal associated with this new agreement 
in connection with the second sales office  we recorded a facilities restructuring charge of  in fiscal representing the estimated future lease obligations for office space that we were subleasing to a third party 
the third party abandoned the space during fiscal and we believed that it was highly unlikely that we would be able to sublease this space for the remainder of the lease term 
during the fiscal second quarter of  we paid the remaining balance of  of the facilities restructuring accrual in accordance with the plan provisions 
accordingly  as of june   there was no facilities restructuring accrual outstanding 
interest income and other income expense interest income  net of interest expense  was million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the increase in interest income this year is primarily attributable to higher interest rates on installments receivable balances and slightly higher interest rates on invested cash balances 
other income expense is comprised primarily of gains and losses on investments and foreign currency transactions 
gain on investments of  during the fiscal year was the result of the sale of mobius s investment in intelidata stock 
foreign currency gains were  in fiscal  foreign currency losses were  in fiscal and foreign currency gains were  in fiscal provision for benefit from income taxes the tax provision for income taxes was million effective tax provision rate of in fiscal and million in fiscal effective tax provision rate of  compared with a tax benefit of million effective tax benefit rate of in fiscal the tax provision for fiscal includes a tax benefit of  resulting from the resolution of certain tax matters 
excluding the  tax benefit  the effective tax rate was for the fiscal year the lower effective tax rate in fiscal as compared with fiscal exclusive of the  tax benefit was primarily due to a decrease in losses of certain foreign subsidiaries for which no tax benefit could be recognized 
the fluctuation in the effective tax rate from fiscal as compared with fiscal was primarily due to the reversal of previously accrued taxes as the result of the expiration of the statute of limitations on an earlier tax year 
excluding the impact of the reversal of prior years tax reserves  the effective tax benefit rate would have been for fiscal selected quarterly operating results the following table presents certain unaudited consolidated statement of operations data for the eight fiscal quarters in the two year period ended june  in management s opinion  this unaudited information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k and includes all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the quarters presented  when read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein

our quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future 
for a further discussion of the factors that could impact quarterly results  see the section entitled factors affecting future performance above 
historically  license revenues typically peak primarily in the fourth fiscal quarter ending june and to a lesser extent in the second fiscal quarter ending december 
these fluctuations are caused primarily by customer purchasing patterns and our sales force incentive programs  which recognize and reward sales personnel on the basis of achievement of annual and other periodic performance quotas  as well as by the factors described above 
changes in buying patterns  product mix and sales force incentive programs may alter these historical seasonality patterns 
liquidity and capital resources executive overview since our inception  we have funded our operations principally through cash flows from operating activities and  to a lesser extent  equity or bank financings 
as of june   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  a slight increase from the million held at june  during fiscal  reductions in accounts receivable and software license installments receivable were offset by cash losses net loss adjusted for depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes and other non cash charges and a reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
as of june  and  the company had no bank debt outstanding 
we believe that our existing cash balances and cash flows expected from future operations will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least months 
as discussed in the section entitled  software license installments receivable below  we have entered into a number of license contracts having extended payment terms 
we continue to monitor the level of sales that include extended payment terms to manage the use of cash associated with these sales 
we entered into an arrangement during our fiscal first quarter of that provides us with the option of selling installments receivable to general electric capital corporation gecc 
this arrangement gives us enhanced flexibility in offering financing alternatives to our customers and in managing our cash flows 
during fiscal  we sold approximately million of installments receivable under this arrangement 
if the level of software license revenues financed by installments receivable increases and we are unable to assign a substantial percentage of such receivables to gecc or other vendor financing firms  our cash position is likely to be adversely affected 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  net cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal and net cash provided by operating activities was  in fiscal our sources of cash during fiscal were primarily from net income adjusted for non cash items  collections of accounts receivable and an increase in deferred revenue  partially offset by an increase in software license installments 
our uses of cash during fiscal were increases in software license installments receivable  partially offset by net income adjusted for non cash items and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
our sources of cash during fiscal were collections in accounts receivable and software license installments receivable  partially offset by net loss adjusted for non cash items and reductions in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
software license installments  which increased from million at june  to million at june   decreased to million at june   represent payments due from customers for license fees that are paid over the term of the installment agreement 
the increase during fiscal was due to a proportionately greater amount of current license revenues being financed by the company 
the decrease during fiscal was due to collections and the sale of approximately million of installments receivable to gecc 
for additional information  see the section entitled  software license installments receivable below 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal  and net cash used in investing activities was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal reflects the sale of marketable securities  partially offset by capital expenditures 
for the years ended june   and  cash of million  million and million  respectively  was used for the purchase of computer software and equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements 
net cash provided by financing activities was  million and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal  and  cash was provided by the exercise of stock options by employees and employee stock purchases under the employee stock purchase plan 
our material obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts consist of our operating leases for our office facilities 
these leases expire on various dates through fiscal and provide for additional payments relating to utility costs 
as of june   the future minimum lease payments for these operating leases are as follows in thousands operating leases year ended june   june   june   june   june   thereafter total minimum lease payments  in addition to the commitments shown above  we have commitments at june  for future purchases of goods and services of approximately  in compliance with the lease of our corporate headquarters in rye  ny  the landlord holds a letter of credit issued by a bank totaling  secured by a certificate of deposit 
on october  the cytura closing date  the company  through a wholly owned subsidiary  acquired technology the contenuity software and certain other assets of cytura  a privately held company  for an aggregate of approximately million in cash  which was paid from our existing cash balances 
in addition  we assumed capital lease obligations of  and incurred acquisition related expenses of  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the contenuity software provides a platform for web site implementation and management  document and digital asset management and content publishing 
additionally  under the terms of the agreement  we were obligated to pay cytura an additional  within days of the first anniversary of the transaction if the average closing price of our common stock for a day period in the thirteen months following the cytura closing date exceeded specified amounts set forth in the agreement 
during the fiscal fourth quarter of  the average closing price of our common stock exceeded such specified amount 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded incremental goodwill and a payable to cytura of  under the terms of a revised agreement with cytura  we made the  payment to cytura in january on april  the emanage closing date  the company  through a wholly owned subsidiary  acquired technology and certain other assets of emanage  a privately held company  for an aggregate of approximately million in cash  which was paid from our existing cash balances
