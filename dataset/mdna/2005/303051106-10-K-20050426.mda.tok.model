we entered into a secured financing facility with wells fargo llc  which became effective concurrent with the plan  to repay the outstanding amounts owed under our debtor in possession revolving financing agreement and fund our obligations under the plan and our ongoing operations following emergence from bankruptcy 
borrowings under this agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets 
juvenile party expansion in fiscal we entered into agreements with party express by hallmark and designware by american greetings to sell licensed party tableware and accessories 
this new assortment has increased the selection of our juvenile party patterns by approximately and increased the selection of licensed party patterns and accessories by more than 
we believe this new assortment puts us in a favorable position to compete in the expanding market of juvenile party 
greeting card agreement on february   we entered into a definitive agreement with the premier greetings division of paramount cards inc to be our primary supplier of everyday and seasonal greeting cards 
this agreement will considerably broaden our position as a leading provider of exceptional quality  value priced  social expressions merchandise 
we believe that the improved quality and outstanding selection of the premier greetings offering will re energize our card sales and bolster our position as one of the foremost specialty retailers of greeting cards and party supplies in the united states 
this agreement enables the repositioning of our greeting card strategy by introducing a multi tiered pricing program featuring high quality greeting cards retailing at a new low price of cents  blended with the introduction of premium greeting cards selling for cents 
as we replace our one price  cent strategy  our customers will benefit from a greatly improved greeting card value  enriched by our relationship with premier greetings  a company with excellent resources and a recognized leader in the greeting card industry 
under the terms of the agreement  substantially all the cards sold will be supplied by premier greetings 
the terms will allow us to materially reduce our ongoing inventory position of greeting card merchandise 
in connection with this program  we recorded a pre tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal primarily related to the write down of inventory 
we intend to begin the roll out of our new greeting card offering at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have prepared the accompanying financial statements in conformity with accounting principles 
table of contents generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies utilized in the preparation of these financial statements 
fresh start accounting as is more fully discussed in note fresh start accounting in our notes to consolidated financial statements  we adopted fresh start accounting pursuant to the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code sop  during the first quarter of fiscal resulting in a change in the basis of accounting of our underlying assets and liabilities at the effective date 
accordingly  our financial statements before and after the effective date are not comparable 
the operating results for the nine weeks ended april  were significantly impacted by items associated with emerging from bankruptcy including debt forgiveness  restructuring activities and certain changes to record the excess of book value over enterprise value 
upon implementation of fresh start accounting  our total assets and total liabilities and stockholders equity were adjusted downward by approximately million 
revenue recognition revenues include the selling price of party goods sold  net of returns and discounts  and are recognized at the point of sale 
we estimate returns based upon historical return rates and such amounts have not been significant 
impairment of long lived assets we review each store for impairment indicators annually  considering operating results and cash flows 
we are not aware of any impairment indicators for any of our stores at january  merchandise inventories as discussed in note summary of significant accounting polices in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or estimated net realizable value utilizing the retail method 
we perform periodic evaluations of the net realizable value of merchandise  including merchandise which is to be discontinued from our ongoing inventory assortment as well as inventory with excess quantities on hand and certain seasonal inventory remaining from past holidays 
based upon these evaluations  a provision for the excess of inventory cost over the net realizable value is recorded as a reduction to the net inventory balance 
at january  and january   we had reserves of and million respectively  for certain merchandise  which is to be discontinued from our ongoing inventory assortment  as well as inventory with excess quantities on hand  and certain seasonal inventory from past holidays 
included in the reserve at january  is the for the write down of inventory related to the new greeting card agreement with premier greetings 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
prior to our emergence from bankruptcy  we capitalized certain buying and warehousing costs as a component of inventory 
as of the emergence date  we discontinued this practice  recording all of the aforementioned costs in cost of sales 
going forward  we do not anticipate that the change will have a significant impact on periodic earnings 
we receive vendor allowances principally as a result of meeting defined purchase levels or promoting vendors products 
those received as a result of purchase levels are accrued as a reduction of merchandise purchase price over the incentive period and result in a reduction of cost of sales 
those received for promoting vendors products are offset against advertising expense and result in a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses 
markdown allowances reduce cost of goods sold in the period the related markdown is taken 
placement allowances are offset against incremental expenses incurred and the remainder  if any  over the 
table of contents contract period 
in september  the emerging issues task force eitf issued accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  which addressed the accounting for rebates retailers receive from vendors 
our accounting policies relating to cash received from vendors are consistent with the conclusions reached by the eitf 
liabilities for insurance claims provision for these losses to the extent not insured are recorded based upon our estimated losses for claims incurred 
the provisions are based upon our historical cost 
income taxes temporary differences arising from differing treatment of income and expense items for tax and financial reporting purposes result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are recorded on the balance sheet 
these balances  as well as income tax expense  are determined through management s estimations  interpretation of tax law for multiple jurisdictions and tax planning 
if our actual results differ from estimated results due to changes in tax laws  new store locations or tax planning  our effective tax rate and tax balances could be affected 
we assess our deferred tax assets and establish valuation allowances when it is determined that deferred tax assets are not likely to be realized 
use of estimates this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
it is important that readers of this discussion of financial condition and results of operations and the accompanying consolidated financial statements understand that actual results may differ from such estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
new accounting pronouncements in february  the chief accountant of the securities exchange commission issued a letter clarifying his staff s interpretation of certain accounting issues and their application under generally accepted accounting principles gaap relating to operating leases 
in summary  their interpretation is that leasehold improvements should be amortized by the lessee over the shorter of their economic lives or the lease term  which could include lease renewal terms when the renewals are reasonably assured  free or reduced rents should be recognized by the lessee on a straight line basis over the lease term including any free or reduced rent period and the statement of cash flows should reflect cash received from the lessor that is accounted for as a lease incentive within operating activities and the acquisition of leasehold improvements for cash within investing activities 
these positions are based upon existing accounting literature 
we believe that our present accounting policies are materially consistent with the positions described by the chief accountant and his staff in this letter 
our policy is to amortize leasehold improvements for years or the life of the lease  whichever period is shorter 
our policy is to amortize free or reduced rent on a straight line basis over the lease term including any free or reduced rent periods 
cash received from lessors landlords is recorded as an increase to deferred rent and amortized over the lease term and is included within operating activities 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting 
table of contents for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
we must adopt sfas r in our first fiscal quarter of fiscal early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we have not yet determined which method we will use 
as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method per opinion no 
and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of the fair value method per sfas r will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the pro forma disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb published sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter  which clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we believe that sfas no 
will not have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales and the number of stores open at the end of each period 
effective april   we emerged from chapter bankruptcy proceedings and implemented fresh start accounting 
accordingly  all assets and liabilities were restated to reflect their respective fair values 
the consolidated financial statements after that date are those of a new reporting entity and are not comparable to pre confirmation periods 
however  for purposes of this discussion  the weeks ended february  successor company has been combined with the nine weeks ended april  predecessor company 
differences between periods due to fresh start accounting adjustments are explained when necessary 
the lack of comparability in the accompanying consolidated financial statements is most apparent in our capital costs lease  interest  depreciation and amortization  as well as income taxes  debt restructuring and reorganization costs 

table of contents the following table is included solely for use in comparative analysis of results of operations and to complement management s discussion and analysis 
successor company successor company successor company predecessor company combined fiscal weeks ended january  weeks ended january  weeks ended february  nine weeks ended april  weeks ended february  net sales cost of sales greeting card inventory write down gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization reorganization items other income interest expense income loss before income tax expense benefit income tax expense benefit net income loss number of stores open at end of period weeks ended january  fiscal compared to weeks ended january  fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal increase in net sales is attributable to the increased number of stores 
comparable store sales  which are defined as sales from those stores open for at least one full year  increased over fiscal positive comparable sales in our balloon  candy and basic party categories were offset by decreases in other categories 
declines in sales were attributable to a highly competitive retail environment

gross profit increased million to million in fiscal from fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal included in fiscal cost of sales is the million write down of greeting card inventory related to the new program  which is planned to roll out in may with the exception of the greeting card write down  we were successful in managing merchandise margins by reducing markdown activity and by obtaining a higher mark on percentage on goods available for sale 
additionally  we continue to leverage our freight and distribution costs 
as a percent of sales  freight and distribution costs improved from fiscal store occupancy costs increased million or primarily as a result of additional stores 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include store payroll  advertising  and other store operating and corporate administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal store related expenses increased million or as a function of operating additional stores while net advertising expense decreased million or as we leverage our advertising distribution while opening new stores in existing markets 
other corporate administrative expenses increased million or because of rising payroll and insurance costs  professional fees and other corporate governance costs 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal 
table of contents depreciation expense 
depreciation expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase is attributable to fixed asset additions primarily related to new store openings and remodels 
reorganization items 
the million of reorganization items represents a reversal of estimated costs accrued which were associated with our emergence from bankruptcy in fiscal we do not anticipate any significant reorganization costs in the future 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decrease resulted from a lower effective interest rate coupled with lower average borrowings as we continue to positively manage our working capital 
income tax expense benefit 
we recognized income tax benefit of in fiscal compared to income tax expense of million in fiscal the tax benefit of was a function of our pre tax loss position 
tax expenses in fiscal represent approximately of pre tax income loss for the period described 
until the benefits of our net operating loss carry forwards are fully utilized  we do not expect to pay federal income tax 
weeks ended january  fiscal compared to weeks ended february  combined fiscal net sales 
net sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in combined fiscal fiscal net sales include stores that were open at the beginning of the year plus six stores opened during the second half of the fiscal year 
the six new stores contributed million in net sales and were the first new store openings in five years 
sales in the basic party and seasonal category experienced an overall increase in sales as we rolled out the expanded party initiative and offered a wider assortment of seasonal halloween merchandise 
however  the other five categories experienced a decrease in sales 
comparable store sales decreased million or 
because of the timing of store openings in fiscal  the new stores were excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales 
we include stores opened or months after their opening date in the calculation of comparable store sales 
declines in sales were attributable to a highly competitive and promotional retail environment and the effect of a softening economy 
gross profit 
cost of sales includes merchandise  distribution and occupancy costs 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal from in combined fiscal the increase in gross profit is primarily due to an increase in the mark on percentage of merchandise available for sale and decrease in distribution costs of million partially offset by declining sales volume and an increase in occupancy costs of million 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was in fiscal and in combined fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include store payroll  advertising  and other store operating and corporate administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in combined fiscal the increase is related to additional advertising expenses of million as we attempted to drive sales in a difficult retail environment coupled with million increase in corporate administrative expenses related to higher insurance costs  the listing on nasdaq  professional fees as well as additional staff to support the new store openings 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in combined fiscal depreciation expense 
depreciation expense was million in fiscal compared to million in combined fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the fresh start adjustment on fixed assets of million resulting from the write down of fixed assets for the excess of book value over enterprise value 
reorganization items 
we did not recognize any reorganization items in fiscal compared to million gain in combined fiscal no reorganization items have been recorded since we emerged from bankruptcy in april 
table of contents interest expense 
interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in combined fiscal this decrease resulted from decreased borrowing levels due to lower inventory purchases and in increase in vendor terms 
income tax expense benefit 
we recognized income tax expense of million in fiscal compared to income tax expense of in combined fiscal amounts booked after emergence from bankruptcy represent approximately of pre tax income for the period described 
due to the fact we are able to use pre emergence net operating losses  we did not pay federal income tax and the expense recorded in each period resulted  net of the impact of deferred taxes  in a direct increase to stockholders equity 
until the benefits of the net operating loss carry forwards are fully utilized  we do not expect to pay federal income tax 
we recognized an income tax benefit of million for the nine weeks ended april  which resulted from the cash realization of net operating loss carrybacks due to the enactment of the job creation and workers assistance act of liquidity and capital resources our uses of capital for fiscal are expected to include working capital for operating expenses and satisfaction of current liabilities  expenditures related to maintaining and refurbishing existing stores  opening new stores  the repayment of the remaining balance of the extended creditor payment and interest payments on outstanding borrowings 
historically  these cash requirements have been met through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of cash flows data fiscal fiscal in millions in millions cash flows from operating activities cash flows from investing activities cash flows from financing activities on january  our working capital was million 
net cash flows from operating activities in fiscal were million compared to million of net cash flows from operating activities during fiscal the decrease is related to increases in our inventory balances as we open new stores coupled with the leveling off of our days payable outstanding as we continue to maintain favorable trade terms from our vendor community 
net cash flows from investing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal net cash flows from investing activities were primarily for capital expenditures for store remodeling  computer equipment  and warehouse equipment for the distribution center 
additionally  we paid approximately million for furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements relating to the new store openings in fiscal net cash flows from financing activities in fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal amounts are attributable to the level of borrowings and repayments 
we are party to a secured financing facility  dated april   with wells fargo retail finance  llc as amended  the loan agreement 
the loan agreement  which is a line of credit expiring on april   currently provides up to million  including million for letters of credit to fund working capital needs and for general corporate purposes 
borrowings under the facility are limited by a percentage of inventory levels 
at april   the interest rate on our borrowings was 
borrowings under the loan agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets 
the loan agreement contains certain restrictive covenants  which  among other things  require us to achieve specified operating results 
the restrictive covenants also limit our capital expenditures  asset sales and dividends and our ability to grant liens and incur additional indebtedness 
pursuant to the plan of reorganization  we converted million of post petition trade payables into a trade conversion note  which was payable within four years of the effective date 
in addition  we recorded at fair value the million extended creditor payment payable to the general unsecured creditors 

table of contents in fiscal  the trade conversion notes were paid in full 
in addition  we paid the remaining million of extended creditor note on april  as of january   we had million in borrowings outstanding under the loan agreement and had utilized approximately million to issue letters of credit 
we do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future and under our current loan agreement we are restricted from paying dividends on our capital stock 
our ability to make scheduled payments of principal of  or to pay the interest on  or to refinance  indebtedness or to fund planned capital expenditures  will depend upon future performance  which  in turn  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive and other factors that are beyond our control 
based upon our current level of operations and anticipated growth  we believe that future cash flows from operations  together with available borrowings under the loan agreement  will be adequate for the next twelve months to meet anticipated requirements for capital expenditures  working capital  interest payments and scheduled principal payments 
there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures after satisfying certain liabilities arising in the ordinary course of business 
if unable to do so  we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt  sell assets or obtain additional financing 
there can be no assurance that any refinancing would be available or that any sales of assets or additional financing could be obtained 
contractual obligations as discussed in note summary of significant accounting polices in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we conduct substantially all of our activities using leased premises 
store and office leases generally provide that real estate taxes  insurance  common area maintenance  and operating expenses are our obligations 
certain store leases also provide for contingent rentals based on sales in excess of specified minimums 
the approximate cost of fixed assets held under capital leases included in fixed assets was million at january  and january  accumulated depreciation related to such fixed assets was approximately million and million at january  and january   respectively 
fixed assets held under capital leases consist primarily of technology  office and warehouse equipment 
to facilitate an understanding of our contractual obligations  the following data is provided which summarizes future payments payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year years years more than years debt capital leases including current portion operating leases inventory purchase commitments including open purchase orders total included in debt capital leases is the million in borrowings outstanding under the loan agreement at january  off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purposes of raising capital  incurring debt or operating our business 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources 

table of contents trends  risks and uncertainties in addition to other matters identified or described by us from time to time in filings with the securities and exchange commission  there are several important factors that could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results or trends  results anticipated or planned by us  or results that are reflected from time to time in any forward looking statement that may be made by us or on our behalf 
some of these important factors  but not necessarily all of the important factors  are as follows intense competition in our industry could prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues and prevent us from achieving or sustaining profitability 
the greeting card  party supply and special occasion retailing business is highly competitive 
increased competition by existing or future competitors may reduce our sales and cause us to incur a loss 
as a result of competition from other specialty party supplies and paper goods retailers  we may need to incur additional marketing and promotional expenses to achieve sales growth in our existing stores 
our stores compete with a variety of smaller and larger retailers  including specialty party supplies and paper goods retailers  including other party superstores  card shops and designated departments in mass merchandisers  warehouse merchandise clubs and discount general merchandise chains  toy stores  drug stores  supermarkets  dollar stores  department stores of local  regional and national chains  and internet retailers 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and personnel resources than we do 
we may encounter additional competition from new entrants in the future in our existing markets 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly or adjust prices more effectively to take advantage of new opportunities or customer requirements 
increased competition could result in pricing pressures  reduced sales  reduced margins or failure to achieve or maintain widespread market acceptance  any of which could prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues and achieving or sustaining profitability 
customers requirements are likely to evolve  and we will not retain customers or attract new customers if we do not anticipate and meet specific customer requirements and changes in merchandising trends 
our core operations rely on a stable customer base 
failure to maintain existing customers and obtain new customers will adversely affect our market position 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to anticipate and respond to changing merchandise trends and consumer demands in a timely manner 
accordingly  any delay or failure by us in identifying and responding to emerging trends could adversely affect consumer acceptance of the merchandise in our stores 
if we are required to sell a significant amount of unsold inventory at below average mark ups over our cost or below cost  such action could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we make merchandising decisions well in advance of the seasons during which we will sell the merchandise 
as a result  if we fail to identify and respond quickly to emerging trends  consumer acceptance of the merchandise in our stores could diminish and we may experience a reduction in revenues 
we sell certain 
table of contents licensed products that are in great demand for short time periods  making it difficult to project our inventory needs for these products 
significantly greater or less than projected product demand could lead to one or more of the following lost sales due to insufficient inventory  higher carrying costs associated with slower turning inventory  and reduced or eliminated margins due to mark downs on excess inventory 
if consumer demand for single use  disposable party goods were to diminish  the party supplies and paper goods industry and our revenues would be negatively affected 
for example  if cost increases in raw materials such as paper  plastic  cardboard or petroleum were to cause our prices to increase significantly  consumers might decide to forgo the convenience associated with single use  disposable products 
similarly  changes in consumer preferences away from disposable products and in favor of reusable products for environmental or other reasons could reduce the demand for our products 
if customers do not respond favorably to our new greeting card strategy  our financial results will be adversely affected 
in the second quarter of we intend to introduce a new greeting card strategy 
in connection with this strategy  we will be introducing a premium priced greeting card with an everyday price of cents 
we intend to roll back the price of our value line greeting cards from cents to cents 
our customers may not respond favorably to the new greeting card program 
in addition  we may experience a decline in sales and income as a result of lowering the price of our value line greeting cards to cents and b decline in the aggregate number of greeting cards sold  which in either case could have an adverse effect on our business 
a downturn in the economy may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items  which could reduce our sales 
in general  our sales represent discretionary spending by our customers 
discretionary spending is affected by many factors  including  among others  general business conditions  interest rates  the availability of consumer credit  taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions 
our customers purchases of discretionary items  including our products  could decline during periods when disposable income is lower or during periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions 
if this occurs  our revenues and profitability will decline 
in addition  our sales could be adversely affected by a continued downturn in the economic conditions of the markets in which we operate 
our business depends on continued good relations with our suppliers 
our failure to maintain good relationships with our principal suppliers or the loss of our principal suppliers would hurt our business 
we purchase our inventory from more than vendors world wide  with the largest supplier representing approximately and the ten largest suppliers representing approximately of our aggregate purchases in fiscal many of our principal suppliers currently provide us with incentives like volume purchasing allowances and trade discounts 
if our suppliers were to reduce or discontinue these incentives  prices from our suppliers would increase and our profitability would be reduced 
as is customary in our industry  we generally do not have long term contracts with any suppliers and any supplier could discontinue selling to us at any time  however  pursuant to our bankruptcy plan of reorganization  we entered into agreements with certain of our trade vendors to provide us with competitive trade terms  including  extended credit limits  extended payment terms and seasonal advances 
while we are not aware of any reasons to question the operational or financial ability of such vendors either to ship or provide such terms  the inability of any of such vendors to do so could adversely affect our competitive financial performance 
our arrangements with overseas suppliers are subject to risks of doing business abroad  such as import duties  trade restrictions  work stoppages  political instability and other factors which could have an adverse effect on our business 
on february   we entered into a definitive agreement with the premier greetings division of paramount cards inc under the terms of the agreement  paramount will supply substantially all of our greeting 
table of contents cards 
as a result of this agreement  we will become more dependent on one supplier for providing greeting cards to our stores 
the failure of paramount to adequately satisfy the needs of our customers or to meet our greeting card volume requirements could have an adverse effect on our business 
we may need to raise additional capital to fund our operations and support our long term growth strategy 
our ability to make scheduled payments of principal of  or to pay the interest on  or to refinance  indebtedness or to fund planned capital expenditures  will depend upon our future performance  which  in turn  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive and other factors that are beyond our control 
based upon our current level of operations and anticipated growth  we believe that future cash flow from operations  together with available borrowings under our financing facility  will be adequate to meet our anticipated requirements for capital expenditures  working capital  interest payments and scheduled principal payments 
there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures after satisfying certain liabilities arising in the ordinary course of business 
if unable to do so  we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt  sell assets or obtain additional financing 
there can be no assurance that any refinancing would be available or available on favorable terms or that any sales of assets or additional financing could be obtained or obtained on favorable terms 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products and services  implement our long term growth strategy  take advantage of future opportunities or respond in a timely manner to competitive pressures 
we are substantially leveraged and our financing facility contains covenants that could adversely affect our business 
our indebtedness restricts our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and  because we may be more leveraged than some of our competitors  may place us at a competitive disadvantage 
also  the financing facility that we entered into as part of our emergence from bankruptcy contains covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us 
these covenants could adversely affect our ability to finance future operations  potential acquisitions or capital needs or to engage in other business activities that may be in our best interest 
the seasonal nature of our business could adversely impact our operations 
our business is highly seasonal  with operating results varying from quarter to quarter 
we have historically experienced higher sales during the second and fourth quarters primarily due to increased demand by customers for our products attributable to special occasions and holiday seasons during these periods 
lower sales than expected by us during these periods  a lack of availability of product  or a general economic downturn in sales could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations for the full year 
in addition  the timing of new store openings  related pre opening expenses and the amount of revenue contributed by new and existing stores may cause our quarterly results of operations to fluctuate 
any or all of these factors could also cause the price of our common stock to decline 
we may not be able to profitably grow our business 
in order to profitably grow our business  we need to increase sales in our existing markets and open additional stores 
opening additional stores in existing markets could reduce sales from our stores located in or near those markets and stores opened in new markets may not be profitable 
in addition  the opening of new stores could put additional strain on our existing infrastructure and may limit our ability to effectively leverage the costs of the new stores 
we may not be able to effectively execute our long term growth strategy 
our long term growth strategy requires effective planning and management 
once a new geographic market is identified  we must obtain suitable store sites on acceptable terms 
also  the competitive and merchandising challenges we face in new geographic markets may be different from the challenges we face in our existing 
table of contents geographic markets 
we may have to adapt to regional tastes and customs and compete against established and familiar local businesses with innovative or unique techniques for marketing party supplies and paper goods 
entering new markets may also place significant demands on our management  financial controls  operations and information systems 
this may cause us to incur higher costs relating to marketing and operations 
expansion will require an increase in our personnel  particularly store managers and sales associates  to operate our new stores 
higher administrative expenses could adversely affect our business and operations 
higher selling  general and administrative expenses occasioned by the potential need for additional advertising  marketing  administrative or management information systems expenditures could negatively impact our business and operations 
adverse publicity could adversely affect our business 
we generally operate in medium sized towns and suburban neighborhoods 
adverse publicity or news coverage relating to us could negatively impact our efforts to establish and promote name recognition and a positive image 
if we do not comply with the numerous laws and regulations that govern our business  our business could be harmed 
each of our stores must comply with regulations adopted by federal agencies and with licensing and other regulations enforced by state and local health  sanitation  safety  fire and other departments 
more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to zoning  land use and environmental factors  and difficulties or failures in obtaining the required licenses or approvals  can delay and sometimes prevent  the opening of a new store 
in addition  we comply with the fair labor standards act and various state laws governing various matters such as minimum wage  overtime and other working conditions 
we also comply with the provisions of the americans with disabilities act of  as amended  which requires generally that employers provide reasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities and that stores be accessible to customers with disabilities 
we believe that the procedures currently in effect at our stores are in general compliance with such laws and regulations 
however  future violations of such laws  the enactment of stricter laws or regulations or the implementation of more aggressive enforcement policies could adversely affect our operations or financial condition 
if we are unable to hire additional qualified personnel or retain existing personnel  we may not be able to operate our business successfully 
our success depends upon the efforts of our senior management and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of any member of our management team or a key employee  or a failure to timely retain a replacement officer could have a material adverse effect on us 
our future success will also depend in part on attracting and retaining quality employees 
many of our employees are in entry level or part time positions with historically high rates of turnover 
our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors  such as unemployment levels  minimum wage legislation and changing demographics 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining our existing key personnel or in attracting and retaining additional employees we may require 
any difficulties in obtaining  retaining and training qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on us 
interruption or obsolescence of our management information systems could have a negative effect on our competitive ability and our business generally 
we believe that our management information systems are an important factor in supporting our business and enhancing our competitive position in the industry 
over the past three years  we have invested significant resources in systems and infrastructure to support our business and make it more efficient 
we use a management information and control system  which is based on the jda merchandise management system software package 
table of contents jda and supports the complete range of retail cycle functions in the areas of finance  merchandising and distribution 
all stores are linked to our headquarters through personal computers  which interface with an ibm as and provide auto replenishment of inventory and the ability to enter payroll information and send and receive electronic mail 
these personal computers are also tied into our point of sale system pos system 
the pos system provides sales information to our stores and central office and is used to enhance merchandise planning and buying programs 
any obsolescence or continuing interruption in the functioning of these systems could have a negative effect on our ability to compete effectively in the industry and on our business 
our warrants and stock options may have significant dilutive effects on holders of common stock generally 
pursuant to our bankruptcy plan of reorganization  we issued four series of warrants to holders of our old pre bankruptcy common stock to purchase up to approximately subject to certain dilution events of the common stock issued under the bankruptcy plan assuming exercise of all such warrants 
these four series of warrants are exercisable for terms ranging from four to eight years 
we currently have stock option plans pursuant to which we have the authority to issue options to our employees and directors for up to  shares of our common stock 
as of january   there were options issued to purchase  shares of our common stock outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of per share 
the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of the four series of warrants  the exercise of stock options  and the antidilution rights protection of the warrants issued to management could significantly dilute the holders of common stock currently issued and outstanding 
certain provisions of our charter may prevent or delay a change of control of the company 
our certificate of incorporation provides for a classified board of directors 
any effort to obtain control of our board of directors by causing the election of a majority of the board of directors may require more time than would be required without a staggered election structure 
our certificate of incorporation also imposes restrictions on the direct or indirect transferability of our common stock  subject to certain exceptions  such that no person or certain groups of persons x may acquire or accumulate five percent or more as determined under tax law principles governing the application of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended of the common stock or y who  upon implementation of the plan  owns or more of the common stock  may acquire additional common stock 
these provisions would have the effect of preventing a change of control for the duration of such restrictions 
it is difficult to compare post emergence financial information with that of prior periods 
since we emerged from bankruptcy on april   there is limited operating and financial data available from which to analyze our operating results and cash flow 
as a result of fresh start reporting  it is difficult to compare information reflecting our results of operations and financial condition after our emergence from bankruptcy to the results of prior periods 
see selected financial data 
our stock price may be volatile and could decline 
since the effective date of our bankruptcy restructuring  our common stock has had limited trading activity 
we cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in our stock will lead to the development of a more active trading market  how liquid that market might become or whether it will be sustained 
the trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations due to the factors discussed in this risk factors section and elsewhere in this document  including our operating results failing to meet the expectations of our investors  material announcements by us or our competitors  
table of contents governmental regulatory action  or adverse changes in general market conditions or economic trends 
in addition  the stock markets in general have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
we do not anticipate paying dividends 
we have not paid dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future 
we intend to retain future earnings  if any  to finance the expansion of our operations and for general corporate purposes  including future acquisitions 
in addition  our financing facility prohibits us from paying dividends on our capital stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are subject to market risks from changes in interest rates 
the interest rate on our revolving credit facilities  which represents a significant portion of our outstanding debt  is variable based upon earnings performance  the libor and the prime rate with a minimum threshold of 
a hypothetical percent increase to the average interest rate under the credit facilities applied to the average outstanding balance during the week week period ended january  would not have had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations
