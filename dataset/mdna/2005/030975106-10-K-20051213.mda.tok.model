item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a relates to amerigas partners and the operating partnership 
our md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k 
executive overview amerigas partners  the largest retail propane marketer in the united states  achieved net income of million during fiscal  which includes a million loss on the early extinguishment of debt and a million after tax gain on the sale of its ownership interest in atlantic energy  inc atlantic energy 
the loss on early extinguishment of debt was a result of the partnership s refinancing of million of senior notes due with million of senior notes due the refinancing  which will reduce annual interest expense by approximately million 
fiscal was a challenging year due in large part to continued high energy prices and approximately warmer than normal weather 
high energy costs resulted in a higher cost per gallon of propane and higher costs to fuel our delivery vehicles 
similar to fiscal  the partnership was able to manage margins per gallon effectively during another year of rising propane product costs 
however  the increase in retail propane prices negatively impacted our average customer usage causing volumes and total margin to decline 
the propane industry is mature  with only modest growth in residential customer demand foreseen 
accordingly  the partnership s growth strategy focuses on acquisition of other propane marketers and internal growth to be achieved by leveraging its geographical scope to secure regional and national accounts  serving the growing grill cylinder business and offering superior customer service  including unique pricing and payment programs 
in fiscal and beyond  the partnership will continue to focus on growing its traditional customer base  including growth through acquisitions 
the partnership expects to achieve base business growth by providing best in class customer service and improving the effectiveness of its sales force  while maintaining competitive prices 
in addition  the partnership plans to control operating and administrative expenses by executing a series of initiatives to enhance productivity 
analysis of results of operations the following analysis compares the partnership s results of operations for the year ended september  fiscal with the year ended september  fiscal and fiscal with the year ended september  fiscal 
the following table provides gallon  weather and certain financial information for the partnership and should be read in conjunction with fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal millions of dollars year ended september  gallons sold millions retail    wholesale revenues retail propane    wholesale propane other total margin a ebitda b operating income net income degree days warmer colder than normal c a total margin represents total revenues less total cost of sales 
b ebitda earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to service debt obligations and is not a measure of performance or financial condition under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
management believes ebitda is a meaningful non gaap financial measure used by investors to compare the partnership s operating performance with other companies within the propane industry and to evaluate the partnership s ability to meet loan covenants 
the partnership s definition of ebitda may be different from that used by other companies 
weather significantly impacts demand for propane and profitability because many customers use propane for heating purposes 
the following table includes reconciliations of net income to ebitda for the fiscal years presented year ended september  net income income tax expense interest expense depreciation amortization ebitda c deviation from average heating degree days based upon national weather statistics provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa for airports in the united states  excluding alaska 
fiscal compared with fiscal weather in our service territories based upon heating degree days during fiscal was warmer than normal compared with weather that was warmer than normal during fiscal retail propane volumes sold decreased approximately principally due to the warmer than normal winter weather and the negative effects of customer conservation on volumes sold  which is primarily attributed to significantly higher propane selling prices 
low margin wholesale propane volumes sold decreased during fiscal reflecting lower volumes sold in connection with product cost hedging activities 
retail propane revenues increased million reflecting a million increase due to higher average selling prices partially offset by a million decrease due to the lower retail volumes sold 
wholesale propane revenues decreased million reflecting a million decrease due to lower volumes sold partially offset by a million increase due to higher average selling prices 
the higher average retail and wholesale selling prices per gallon reflect significantly higher propane product costs 
the average wholesale cost per gallon of propane during fiscal at mont belvieu  one of the major supply points in the united states  was approximately greater than the average cost per gallon during fiscal total cost of sales increased million reflecting the higher propane product costs 
total margin decreased million principally due to the lower retail volumes sold partially offset by higher margin from ancillary sales and services and  to a much lesser extent  slightly higher average retail propane margins per gallon 
contributing to the decline in total margin during fiscal was lower margin generated by our ppx program largely due to competitive pricing pressures and the high cost of propane 
ebitda during fiscal decreased million compared to fiscal as a result of the million loss on early extinguishment of debt resulting from the partnership s refinancing of its senior notes in may  a million increase in operating and administrative expenses and a million decrease in total margin all of which were partially offset by a million increase in other income 
the increase in operating and administrative expenses was primarily due to a million increase in vehicle fuel expense and a million increase in vehicle lease costs 
increases in maintenance and repairs  uncollectible accounts expense and general insurance expense among others also contributed to the higher operating and administrative expenses 
the increase in other income primarily reflects the million pre tax gain on the sale of atlantic energy and higher gains on fixed asset disposals 
although ebitda is not an alternative to cash flow  a measure of liquidity  performance or financial condition under gaap  management believes ebitda is a meaningful non gaap financial measure used by investors to compare the partnership s operating performance with other companies within the propane industry and to evaluate the partnership s ability to meet loan covenants 
operating income increased slightly reflecting the previously mentioned increase in other income and a million decrease in depreciation expense largely offset by the aforementioned higher operating and administrative expenses and lower total margin 
as previously mentioned  the increased other income reflects the gain on the sale of atlantic energy 
the decrease in depreciation expense is largely attributed to lower capital expenditures related to ppx 
net income in fiscal decreased reflecting the million loss on early extinguishment of debt and increased income taxes resulting from the partnership s gain on the sale of its ownership interest in atlantic energy which were slightly offset by million lower interest expense and the slightly higher operating income 
fiscal compared with fiscal based upon heating degree day data  temperatures in fiscal were warmer than normal compared to temperatures that were essentially normal in fiscal retail propane volumes sold during fiscal decreased slightly compared to fiscal as the effects of warmer than normal winter weather more than offset volume growth from acquisitions  principally the october acquisition of horizon propane llc horizon propane 
in addition  fiscal retail propane volumes were also negatively affected by customer conservation driven by significantly higher propane product costs 
low margin wholesale volumes increased primarily reflecting higher volumes sold in connection with product cost hedging activities 
retail propane revenues increased million as a million increase due to higher average selling prices was partially offset by a million decrease due to the lower retail volumes sold 
wholesale propane revenues increased million reflecting a million increase due to higher average selling prices and a million increase due to the higher volumes sold relating to product cost hedging activities 
in fiscal  the propane industry experienced sustained higher propane product costs which resulted in higher average retail and wholesale selling prices 
total propane cost of sales increased million principally reflecting the effects of significantly higher propane product costs 
despite lower retail volumes sold as a result of the warmer weather  total margin increased million due to higher average retail propane margins per gallon and greater margin from non propane sales and services 
as a result of significantly higher propane product costs  the partnership increased average retail selling prices realizing higher average margins per gallon while remaining competitive in the marketplace 
average ppx margin per gallon decreased in fiscal as selling prices were lowered in response to competition in the marketplace 
the effects of lower average ppx selling prices on ppx margin per gallon were partially offset by effective cost management initiatives 
margin from non propane sales and services increased million principally reflecting higher margin from tank rentals  ppx cylinder sales and hauling and terminal sales and services 
ebitda increased million in fiscal reflecting the previously mentioned increase in total margin  the absence of a million loss on extinguishment of long term debt incurred in fiscal  and a million increase in other income 
these increases were partially offset by a million increase in operating and administrative expenses principally due to higher compensation  distribution  administrative and general insurance expenses  partially offset by the absence of million of expenses associated with initiating the management realignment in fiscal and the continued beneficial effects on fiscal operating expenses of the realignment 
other income in fiscal increased principally due to greater income from finance charges 
operating income in fiscal increased million as the previously mentioned increases in margin and other income were partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense related to recent acquisitions  higher depreciation associated with ppx and the aforementioned increase in operating expenses 
net income in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal due to the increase in operating income  a million decrease in interest expense and the absence of the million loss on extinguishment of long term debt incurred in fiscal interest expense decreased principally as a result of lower long term debt outstanding 
financial condition and liquidity capitalization and liquidity the partnership s long term debt outstanding at september  totaled million 
there were no amounts outstanding under amerigas olp s credit agreement at september  amerigas olp has a credit agreement that expires on october  and consists of a million revolving credit facility and a million acquisition facility 
the revolving credit facility may be used for working capital and general purposes of amerigas olp 
the acquisition facility provides amerigas olp with the ability to borrow up to million to finance the purchase of propane businesses or propane business assets or  to the extent it is not so used  for working capital and general purposes  subject to restrictions in the amerigas partners senior notes indentures 
issued and outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility  which reduce the amount available for borrowings  totaled million at september  and was approximately the same amount outstanding during all of fiscal amerigas olp s short term borrowing needs are seasonal and are typically greatest during the fall and winter heating season months due to the need to fund higher levels of working capital 
the average daily borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement during fiscal and fiscal were million and million  respectively 
peak borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement in fiscal and fiscal were million and million  respectively 
amerigas partners periodically issues debt and equity securities and expects to continue to do so 
it has issued debt securities in underwritten public offerings or private offerings and common units in underwritten public offerings in each of the last three fiscal years 
most recently  it issued debt securities in may in a private offering and common units in september in an underwritten public offering 
proceeds from the private debt offering were used to fund the refinancing 
proceeds from amerigas partners securities offerings are generally used to reduce indebtedness and for general partnership purposes  including funding acquisitions 
amerigas partners has an effective unallocated debt and equity shelf registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission sec under which it may issue up to an additional million of debt or equity 
in order to borrow under its credit agreement  amerigas olp must maintain certain financial ratios including a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum debt to ebitda ratio  as defined 
amerigas olp s ratios calculated as of september  permit it to borrow up to the maximum amount available 
for a more detailed discussion of the partnership s credit facilities  see note to consolidated financial statements 
based upon existing cash balances  cash expected to be generated from operations  borrowings available under its credit agreement  and expected refinancings of maturing long term debt  the partnership s management believes that the partnership will be able to meet its anticipated contractual commitments and projected cash needs in fiscal partnership distributions the partnership makes distributions to its partners approximately days after the end of each fiscal quarter in a total amount equal to its available cash as defined in the third amended and restated agreement of limited partnership the partnership agreement for such quarter 
available cash generally means all cash on hand at the end of such quarter  plus all additional cash on hand as of the date of determination resulting from borrowings after the end of such quarter  less the amount of cash reserves established by the general partner in its reasonable discretion 
in april  the general partner declared an increase in the partnership s regular quarterly distribution from to per limited partner unit which was payable on may  to unit holders of record on may  the annualized distribution rate after the increase will be per limited partner unit 
the amount of available cash needed annually to pay distributions on all units and the general partner interests in fiscal  and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
based upon the number of partnership units outstanding on september   the amount of available cash needed annually to pay distributions on all units and the general partner interests is approximately million 
a reasonable proxy for the amount of cash available for distribution that is generated by the partnership can be calculated by subtracting from the partnership s ebitda interest expense and capital expenditures needed to maintain operating capacity and adding back losses on extinguishments of debt associated with refinancings 
partnership distributable cash as calculated under this method for fiscal  and is as follows year ended september  millions of dollars net income income tax expense interest expense depreciation amortization ebitda interest expense maintenance capital expenditures loss on extinguishment of debt distributable cash although distributable cash is a reasonable estimate of the amount of cash available for distribution by the partnership  it does not reflect  among other things  the impact of changes in working capital and the amount of distributable cash used to finance growth capital expenditures  which can significantly affect cash available for distribution 
distributable cash should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to service debt obligations and is not a measure of performance or financial condition under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
management believes distributable cash is a meaningful non gaap measure for evaluating the partnership s ability to declare and pay distributions pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement 
the partnership s definition of distributable cash may be different from that used by other companies 
the ability of the partnership to pay distributions on all units depends upon a number of factors 
these factors include the level of partnership earnings  the cash needs of the partnership s operations including cash needed for maintaining and increasing operating capacity  changes in operating working capital  and the partnership s ability to borrow under its credit agreement  to refinance maturing debt and to increase its long term debt 
some of these factors are affected by conditions beyond our control including weather  competition in markets we serve  the cost of propane and changes in capital market conditions 
contractual cash obligations and commitments the partnership has certain contractual cash obligations that extend beyond fiscal including obligations associated with long term debt  interest on long term fixed rate debt  lease obligations and propane supply contracts 
the following table presents significant contractual cash obligations as of september  in millions of dollars payments due by period year after total or less years years years long term debt interest on long term fixed rate debt operating leases propane supply contracts total  cash flows operating activities 
due to the seasonal nature of the partnership s business  cash flows from operating activities are generally strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for propane consumed during the heating season months 
conversely  operating cash flows are generally at their lowest levels during the first and fourth fiscal quarters when the partnership s investment in working capital  principally accounts receivable and inventories  is generally greatest 
the partnership uses its credit agreement to satisfy its seasonal operating cash flow needs 
cash flow from operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating working capital was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal changes in operating working capital provided million in fiscal and used million and million of operating cash flow in fiscal and  respectively 
the cash provided by operating working capital in fiscal is largely due to the timing of inventory purchases  increased propane product costs and the timing of customer payments 
investing activities 
cash flow used in investing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we spent million for property  plant and equipment comprising million of maintenance capital expenditures and million of growth capital expenditures in fiscal compared to expenditures of million comprising maintenance capital expenditures of million and growth capital expenditures of million in fiscal proceeds received from disposals of assets increased million reflecting more strategic divestitures of district locations during fiscal than in fiscal in november  the partnership sold its ownership interest in atlantic energy for million 
during fiscal  the partnership acquired several propane distribution businesses for total cash consideration of million 
financing activities 
cash flow used by financing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the partnership s financing activities are typically the result of repayments and issuances of long term debt  borrowings under our credit agreement  issuances of common units and distributions on partnership interests 
in april  the partnership repaid million of maturing amerigas olp first mortgage notes with the proceeds from a million term loan amerigas olp term loan due october   borrowings under its credit agreement and existing cash balances 
in may  the partnership refinanced million of its outstanding senior notes due through the issuance of million of senior notes due in connection with the refinancing  the partnership incurred a loss on early extinguishment of debt totaling million 
in september  amerigas partners sold  common units in an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of per unit 
the net proceeds of the public offering totaling million and the associated capital contributions from the general partner were contributed to amerigas olp and used to reduce indebtedness under its credit agreement and for general partnership purposes 
related party transactions pursuant to the partnership agreement and a management services agreement among amerigas eagle holdings  inc  the general partner of eagle olp  and the general partner  the general partner is entitled to reimbursement for all direct and indirect expenses incurred or payments it makes on behalf of the partnership 
these costs  which totaled million in  million in and million in  include employee compensation and benefit expenses of employees of the general partner and general and administrative expenses 
ugi corporation ugi provides certain financial and administrative services to the general partner 
ugi bills the general partner for all direct and indirect corporate expenses incurred in connection with providing these services and the general partner is reimbursed by the partnership for these expenses 
such corporate expenses totaled million in  million in and million in in addition  ugi and certain of its subsidiaries excluding atlantic energy which is discussed separately provide office space and automobile liability insurance and sold propane to the partnership 
these costs totaled million in  million in and million in prior to the november sale of our ownership interest in atlantic energy  we purchased propane on behalf of atlantic energy 
atlantic energy reimbursed amerigas olp for its purchases plus interest as atlantic energy sold such propane to third parties or to amerigas olp itself 
the total dollar value of propane purchased on behalf of atlantic energy was million in  all of which occurred prior to the sale of our ownership interests 
the total dollar value of propane purchased on behalf of atlantic energy was million in and million in  respectively 
amerigas olp still purchases propane from atlantic energy  now owned by a subsidiary of ugi 
purchases of propane by amerigas olp from atlantic energy during  and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
in november  in conjunction with the sale of our ownership interest in atlantic energy  ugi asset management  inc and amerigas olp entered into a product sales agreement whereby ugi asset management  inc has agreed to sell and amerigas olp has agreed to purchase a specified amount of propane annually at the atlantic energy terminal in chesapeake  virginia 
the product sales agreement took effect on april  and will continue for an initial term of five years with an option to extend the agreement for up to an additional five years 
the price to be paid for product purchased under the agreement will be determined annually using a contractual formula that takes into account published index prices and the locational value of deliveries at the atlantic energy terminal 
prior to the sale of atlantic energy  the general partner also provided it with other services including accounting  insurance and other administrative services and was reimbursed for the related costs 
such costs were not material during fiscal  or in addition  amerigas olp entered into product cost hedging contracts on behalf of atlantic energy 
when these contracts were settled  amerigas olp was reimbursed the cost of any losses by  or distributed the proceeds of any gains to  atlantic energy 
amounts due to atlantic energy at september  totaled million  which is included in accounts payable related parties in the consolidated balance sheet 
amounts due from atlantic energy at september  totaled million  which is included in accounts receivable related parties in the consolidated balance sheet 
the partnership sold propane to certain affiliates of ugi 
such amounts were not material during fiscal  or off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are expected to have an effect on the partnership s financial condition  change in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
market risk disclosures our primary financial market risks include commodity prices for propane and interest rates on borrowings 
the risk associated with fluctuations in the prices the partnership pays for propane is principally a result of market forces reflecting changes in supply and demand for propane and other energy commodities 
the partnership s profitability is sensitive to changes in propane supply costs  and the partnership generally attempts to pass on increases in such costs to customers 
the partnership may not  however  always be able to pass through product cost increases fully  particularly when product costs rise rapidly 
in order to reduce the volatility of the partnership s propane market price risk  we use contracts for the forward purchase or sale of propane  propane fixed price supply agreements  and over the counter derivative commodity instruments including price swap and option contracts 
over the counter derivative commodity instruments utilized by the partnership to hedge forecasted purchases of propane are generally settled at expiration of the contract 
in order to minimize credit risk associated with derivative commodity contracts  we carefully monitor established credit limits with the contract counterparties 
although we use derivative financial and commodity instruments to reduce market price risk associated with forecasted transactions  we do not use derivative financial and commodity instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the partnership has both fixed rate and variable rate debt 
changes in interest rates impact the cash flows of variable rate debt but generally do not impact its fair value 
conversely  changes in interest rates impact the fair value of fixed rate debt but do not impact their cash flows 
our variable rate debt includes borrowings under amerigas olp s credit agreement and the amerigas olp term loan 
these agreements have interest rates that are generally indexed to short term market interest rates 
at september  and  there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement 
based upon weighted average borrowings outstanding under these agreements during fiscal and fiscal  an increase in short term interest rates of basis points would have increased our interest expense by approximately million in and million in the remainder of our debt outstanding is subject to fixed rates of interest 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in decreases in the fair value of this fixed rate debt of million and million at september  and  respectively 
a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in increases in the fair market value of this debt of million and million at september  and  respectively 
our long term debt is typically issued at fixed rates of interest based upon market rates for debt having similar terms and credit ratings 
as these long term debt issues mature  we may refinance such debt with new debt having interest rates reflecting then current market conditions 
this debt may have an interest rate that is more or less than the refinanced debt 
in order to reduce interest rate risk associated with near term forecasted issuances of fixed rate debt  from time to time we enter into interest rate protection agreements 
the following table summarizes the fair values of unsettled market risk sensitive derivative instruments held at september  and it also includes the changes in fair value that would result if there were a ten percent adverse change in the market price of propane and interest rates on ten year us treasury notes change in fair fair value value millions of dollars september  propane commodity price risk interest rate risk september  propane commodity price risk interest rate risk because the partnership s derivative instruments generally qualify as hedges under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 we expect that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments used to manage propane price or interest rate risk would be substantially offset by gains or losses on the associated underlying transactions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the selection and application of appropriate accounting principles to the relevant facts and circumstances of the partnership s operations and the use of estimates made by management 
the partnership has identified the following critical accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of the partnership s financial condition and results of operations 
changes in these policies could have a material effect on the financial statements 
the application of these accounting policies necessarily requires management s most subjective or complex judgments regarding estimates and projected outcomes of future events which could have a material impact on the financial statements 
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies  and the estimates and assumptions associated with them  with its audit committee 
in addition  management has reviewed the following disclosures regarding the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee 
litigation accruals 
the partnership is involved in litigation regarding pending claims and legal actions that arise in the normal course of its business 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the partnership establishes reserves for pending claims and legal actions when it is probable that a liability exists and the amount or range of amounts can be reasonably estimated 
reasonable estimates involve management judgments based on a broad range of information and prior experience 
these judgments are reviewed quarterly as more information is received and the amounts reserved are updated as necessary 
such estimated reserves may differ materially from the actual liability and such reserves may change materially as more information becomes available and estimated reserves are adjusted 
depreciation and amortization of long lived assets 
we compute depreciation on property  plant and equipment on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives generally ranging from to years 
we also use amortization methods and determine asset values of intangible assets other than goodwill using reasonable assumptions and projections 
changes in the estimated useful lives of property  plant and equipment and changes in intangible asset amortization methods or values could have a material effect on our results of operations 
as of september   our net property  plant and equipment totaled million 
depreciation expense of million was recorded during fiscal purchase price allocation 
from time to time  we enter into material business combinations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations sfas  the purchase price is allocated to the various assets and liabilities acquired at their estimated fair value 
fair values of assets and liabilities are based upon available information and may involve us engaging an independent third party to perform an appraisal 
estimating fair values can be a complex and judgmental area and most commonly impacts property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  including those with indefinite lives 
generally  we have  if necessary  up to one year from the acquisition date to finalize the purchase price allocation
