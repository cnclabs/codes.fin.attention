item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reference is made throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to notes to consolidated financial statements  which begin on page f of this report 
overview of results of operations and liquidity the company develops and manufactures a broad range of products that are sold worldwide 
the company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own core technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses 
during and  the company carried out the principal aspects of a major reorganization plan under which it sold or spun off many noncore businesses 
in  the company sold spectra physics  its optical technologies segment 
as a result of these actions  the company s continuing operations are comprised solely of its instrument businesses 
the businesses that have been spun off and sold have been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
the company s continuing operations fall into two principal business segments life and laboratory sciences and measurement and control 
revenues dollars in thousands life and laboratory sciences   measurement and control   other  the company s revenues grew by during the strengthening of non us currencies relative to the dollar caused an increase in reported revenues as did acquisitions  net of divestitures 
in addition to the change in revenues caused by currency translation and acquisitions  net of divestitures  which are discussed below  sales increased in  primarily due to increased demand 
the higher demand resulted primarily from a recovery in the us and asian economies that has positively affected capital spending across many markets addressed by the company together with growth from new product introductions 
the company s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in and the principal acquisitions included innaphase corporation  a supplier of laboratory information management systems for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets  which was acquired in september  us counseling services  inc uscs  a supplier of equipment asset management services to the pharmaceutical  healthcare  and related industries  which was acquired in april  jouan sa  a global supplier of products used to prepare and preserve laboratory samples  which was acquired in december  laboratory management systems  inc lmsi  a supplier of regulatory instrument and consulting services to the pharmaceutical and related industries  which was acquired in november  and the personal radiation detection instruments product line from siemens plc  which was acquired in october thermo electron corporation in  the company s operating income and operating income margin improved to million and  respectively  from million and  respectively  in operating income margin is operating income divided by revenues 
the improvement resulted primarily from lower restructuring costs  net  in and a lower cost base following restructuring actions in and  to a lesser extent  higher revenues  offset in part by million of higher amortization expense associated with acquisition related intangible assets 
restructuring and other costs  net  including charges to cost of revenues associated with the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and facility consolidations reduced operating income by million and million in and  respectively 
the company s effective tax rate was and in and  respectively 
the effective tax rate in includes a benefit of million associated with the settlement of tax audits 
the effective tax rate in includes a tax benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance for tax credit carryforwards of million and a tax benefit of million from the sale of a business 
the company expects its effective tax rate in for its existing business will be approximately 
income from continuing operations increased to million in  from million in  primarily due to the higher operating income discussed above  offset in part by lower gains from the sale of investments 
during  the company s cash flow from operations totaled million  compared with million in the increase resulted primarily from higher income offset in part by increased investment in working capital in as of december   the company s outstanding debt totaled million  of which is due in and thereafter 
the company expects to borrow up to million in through a day bridge financing commitment obtained in connection with the january agreement to acquire kendro laboratory products for million  subject to a post closing adjustment 
the commitment is subject to customary conditions for financings of this type 
the company expects that its existing cash and short term investments of million as of december   and the company s future cash flow from operations together with available unsecured borrowings of up to million under its existing year revolving credit agreement and commitment for funds to acquire kendro  are sufficient to meet its capital requirements for the foreseeable future  including at least the next months 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to equity investments  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  warranty obligations  income taxes  pension costs  contingencies and litigation  restructuring  and sale of businesses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience  current market and economic conditions  and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable 
the results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements a the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due 
such allowances totaled million at december  the company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable  the creditworthiness of the customer  and any other information that is relevant to the judgment 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  reducing their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
thermo electron corporation b the company writes down its inventories for estimated obsolescence for differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding months  expected demand  and any other information that is relevant to the judgment 
if ultimate usage or demand vary significantly from expected usage or demand  additional writedowns may be required 
c the company periodically evaluates goodwill for impairment using forecasts of discounted future cash flows 
goodwill totaled billion at december  estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth  asset related expenditures  working capital levels  and other factors 
different assumptions from those made in the company s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company s evaluation of goodwill for impairment 
should the fair value of the company s goodwill decline because of reduced operating performance  market declines  or other indicators of impairment  charges for impairment of goodwill may be necessary 
d the company estimates the fair value of acquisition related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses 
the projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition 
actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values and annual amortization expense from those established at the dates of acquisition 
e the company reviews other long lived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists  such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets 
other long lived assets totaled million at december   including million of fixed assets 
in testing a long lived asset for impairment  assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset 
estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and asset related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment 
should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts  charges for impairment of other long lived assets may be necessary 
f in instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation  the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes 
the company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation 
the allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale 
should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change  the company s revenue recognition would be affected 
if fair value is not available for any undelivered element  revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery is completed 
g in instances where the company sells equipment with customer specified acceptance criteria  the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer s acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition 
if the nature of customer specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence  the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing 
h the company s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services  or elements 
the company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for any undelivered elements 
in the event vsoe is not available for any undelivered element  revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery is completed 
revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
vsoe of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately 
revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are performed  based on vsoe  which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately 
thermo electron corporation i at the time the company recognizes revenue  it provides for the estimated cost of product warranties based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns 
the liability for warranty obligations of the company s continuing operations totaled million at december  should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary 
j the company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction  and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused 
if it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used  the company reverses the related valuation allowance with an offset generally to goodwill as most of the tax attributes arose from acquisitions 
the company s tax valuation allowance totaled million at december  should the company s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates  additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary 
k the company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates 
accrued income taxes totaled million at december  should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit  the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes 
should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained  a reduction in the company s tax provision would result 
l the company estimates losses on contingencies and litigation for which a loss is probable and provides a reserve for losses that can be reasonably estimated 
should the ultimate losses on contingencies and litigation vary from estimates  adjustments to those reserves may be required 
m one of the company s us subsidiaries and several us subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans 
major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  and rate of increase in employee compensation levels 
assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third party actuaries  and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date 
net periodic pension costs for defined benefit plans totaled million in should any of these assumptions change  they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs 
n the company records restructuring charges for the cost of vacating facilities based on future lease obligations and expected sub rental income 
the company s accrued restructuring costs for abandoned facilities in continuing operations totaled million at december  should actual cash flows associated with sub rental income from vacated facilities vary from estimated amounts  adjustments may be required 
o the company estimates the expected proceeds from any assets held for sale and  when necessary  records losses to reduce the carrying value of these assets to estimated realizable value 
should the actual or estimated proceeds  which would include post closing purchase price adjustments  vary from current estimates  results could differ from expected amounts 
p the company considers declines in quoted fair market values of available for sale investments and other equity investments with durations of six to nine months as indicative that the decline may be other than temporary 
as of december   the company held  shares of newport corporation common stock  which it received as partial consideration in the july sale of spectra physics 
the cost and quoted fair market value of the shares at december   were million and million  respectively 
should a decline in quoted fair market value occur  an impairment charge may be required 
thermo electron corporation results of operations compared with continuing operations sales in were billion  an increase of million from the favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of million in sales increased million due to acquisitions  net of divestitures

thermo electron corporation forward looking statements in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  we caution readers that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  our actual results and could cause our actual results in and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by us 
we must develop new products  adapt to rapid and significant technological change  and respond to introductions of new products in order to remain competitive 
our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development 
we sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes  frequent new product and service introductions  and enhancements and evolving industry standards 
without the timely introduction of new products  services  and enhancements  our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time  in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer 
our customers use many of our products to develop  test  and manufacture their own products 
as a result  we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers products 
if we fail to adequately predict our customers needs and future activities  we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue 
many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning  design  development  and testing at the technological  product  and manufacturing process levels 
these activities require us to make significant investments 
products in our markets undergo rapid and significant technological change because of quickly changing industry standards and the introduction of new products and technologies that make existing products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete 
our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers requirements than we can 
the products that we are currently developing  or those we will develop in the future  may not be technologically feasible or accepted by the marketplace  and our products or technologies could become uncompetitive or obsolete 
our measurement and control segment sells products and services to a number of companies that operate in cyclical industries  downturns in those industries would adversely affect our results of operations 
the growth and profitability of some of our businesses in the measurement and control segment depend in part on sales to industries that are subject to cyclical downturns 
for example  certain businesses in this segment depend in part on sales to the steel  cement  and semiconductor industries 
slowdowns in these industries would adversely affect sales by these businesses  which in turn would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
our business is impacted by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate 
adverse economic conditions could adversely impact our business in and beyond  resulting in reduced demand for some of our products  increased rate of order cancellations or delays  increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories  increased pressure on the prices for our products and services  and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable 
thermo electron corporation changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 
we compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal  state  local  and international regulations  such as environmental  health and safety  and food and drug regulations 
we develop  configure  and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations 
any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 
for example  many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs 
changes in the us food and drug administration s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products 
demand for most of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies 
our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies  laboratories  universities  healthcare providers  government agencies  and public and private research institutions 
many factors  including public policy spending priorities  available resources  and product and economic cycles  have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities 
these policies in turn can have a significant effect on the demand for our products 
our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property  and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result 
we place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies  products  and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace 
our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the united states and in other countries 
we own numerous us and foreign patents  and we intend to file additional applications  as appropriate  for patents covering our products 
patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us  and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented  and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages 
in addition  competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies 
intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries  which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position 
we could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others 
an unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how which we seek to protect our products  in part  by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators  employees  and consultants 
these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
in addition  our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors 
third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights 
for example  in september applied biosystems mds scientific instruments and related parties brought a lawsuit against us alleging our mass spectrometer systems infringe a patent held by the plaintiffs 
we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  parties making these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages  as well as injunctive or other equitable relief  which could effectively block our ability to make  use  sell  distribute  or market our products and services in the united states or abroad 
in the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us  or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology  we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents 
however  we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful 
our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale  manufacture  or distribution of our products and  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
thermo electron corporation if any of our security products fail to detect explosives or radiation  we could be exposed to product liability and related claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage 
the products sold by our environmental instruments division include a comprehensive range of fixed and portable instruments used for chemical  radiation  and trace explosives detection 
these products are used in airports  embassies  cargo facilities  border crossings  and other high threat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts 
if any of these products were to malfunction  it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could pass through the product undetected  which could lead to product liability claims 
there are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims  such as the reliability and competence of the customers operators and the training of such operators 
any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage 
although we carry product liability insurance  we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms  if at all 
we have retained contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold 
from through  we divested over businesses with aggregate annual revenues in excess of billion 
as part of these transactions  we retained responsibility for some of the contingent liabilities related to these businesses  such as lawsuits  product liability claims  and potential claims by buyers that representations and warranties we made about the businesses were inaccurate 
the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition  however  we can not be certain that this favorable pattern will continue 
our results could be impacted if we are unable to realize potential future benefits from new productivity initiatives 
in addition to the real estate consolidations and cost saving initiatives that we have pursued over the past three years  we are instituting practical process improvement ppi programs at our locations to further enhance our productivity  efficiency  and customer satisfaction 
while we anticipate continued benefits from these ppi initiatives as well as our continuing sourcing activities  future benefits are expected to be fewer and smaller in size and may be more difficult to achieve 
our branding strategy could be unsuccessful 
we historically operated our business largely as autonomous  unaffiliated companies  and as a result  each of our businesses independently created and developed its own brand names 
our marketing and branding strategy transitions multiple  unrelated brands to one brand  thermo electron 
several of our former brands such as finnigan and nicolet commanded strong market recognition and customer loyalty 
we believe the transition to the one brand enhances and strengthens our collective brand image and brand awareness across the entire company 
our success in promoting our brand depends on many factors  including effective communication of the transition to our customers  acceptance and recognition by customers of this brand  and successful execution of the branding campaign by our marketing and sales teams 
if we are not successful with this strategy  we may experience erosion in our product recognition  brand image and customer loyalty  and a decrease in demand for our products 
it may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth 
some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several years 
to address this issue  we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth  including finding new markets for our products  developing new applications for our technologies  combining sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to compete more effectively  allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects  continuing key customer initiatives  thermo electron corporation expanding our service offerings  strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets  and continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of our breadth in product offerings 
we may not be able to successfully implement these strategies  and these strategies may not result in the growth of our business 
as a multinational corporation  we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations 
international revenues account for a substantial portion of our revenues  and we intend to continue expanding our presence in international markets 
in  our international revenues from continuing operations  including export revenues from the united states  accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms 
international revenues are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect product demand and the profitability in us dollars of products and services provided by us in international markets  where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency 
as a multinational corporation  our businesses occasionally invoice third party customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business the functional currency 
movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations 
in addition  reported sales made in non us currencies by our international businesses  when translated into non us dollars for financial reporting purposes  fluctuate due to exchange rate movement 
should our international sales grow  exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results 
in fiscal and  currency translation had a favorable effect on revenues of our continuing operations of million and million  respectively  due to weakening of the us dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services 
a strengthening of the us dollar would unfavorably affect revenues 
our inability to successfully identify and complete acquisitions or successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services 
promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons  including competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory  including antitrust  approvals 
we may not be able to identify and successfully complete transactions 
any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired company 
further  we may not be able to integrate any acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses  make such businesses profitable  or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies  if any  from these acquisitions  which could adversely affect our business 
moreover  we previously acquired several companies and businesses 
as a result of these acquisitions  we recorded significant goodwill on our balance sheet  which amounts to approximately billion as of december  we assess the realizability of the goodwill we have on our books annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill may be impaired 
these events or circumstances generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset 
our ability to realize the value of the goodwill will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses 
these cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses 
if we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill  we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 
thermo electron corporation item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates  and equity prices  which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities 
additionally  the company uses short term forward contracts to manage certain exposures to currencies 
the company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to hedge firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than its subsidiaries local currencies 
the company does not engage in extensive currency hedging activities  however  the purpose of the company s currency hedging activities is to protect the company s local currency cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
the company s forward currency exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in us dollars  euros  british pounds sterling  and swiss francs 
income and losses arising from forward contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged 
the company does not enter into speculative currency agreements 
interest rates certain of the company s short term available for sale investments and long term obligations are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in a change in the fair value of these financial instruments due to the difference between the market interest rate and the rate at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument 
a decrease in year end and market interest rates would result in a negative impact to the company of million and million  respectively  on the net fair value of its interest sensitive financial instruments 
in addition  interest rate changes would result in a change in the company s interest expense due to variable rate debt instruments 
a basis point increase in day libor at december  and  would increase the company s annual pre tax interest expense by million 
currency exchange rates the company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the company s reporting currency as long term 
the company s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
the functional currencies of the company s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in euros  british pounds sterling  and japanese yen 
the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders equity 
a depreciation in year end and functional currencies  relative to the us dollar  would result in a reduction of shareholders equity of million and million  respectively 
the fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates 
the fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract  taking into account the change in currency exchange rates 
a depreciation in year end and currency exchange rates related to the company s contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency exchange contracts of million and million  respectively 
the unrealized gains or losses on forward currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged 
certain of the company s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates 
a depreciation in the related year end and currency exchange rates would result in a negative impact of million and million  respectively  on the company s net income 
thermo electron corporation equity prices the company s available for sale investment portfolio includes equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in price 
in addition  the company s convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the company s common stock 
changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the company s available for sale investments and convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument 
a decrease in year end and market equity prices would result in a negative impact to the company of million on the net fair value of its price sensitive equity financial instruments  principally its available for sale investments
