item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
except for historical information  the discussion below contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of company overview and industry outlook peet s is a specialty coffee roaster and marketer of fresh  deep roasted whole bean coffee sold through multiple channels of distribution for home and office enjoyment 
founded in berkeley  california in  peet s has established a loyal customer base with strong brand awareness in california 
our national expansion strategy is based on the sale of whole bean coffee in multiple channels of distribution including grocery  home delivery  office and restaurant accounts and company owned stores throughout the united states 
our current expansion strategy is focused in the western united states  where we have strong customer awareness  loyalty and brand affinity 
we expect the specialty coffee industry to continue to grow 
we believe that this growth will be fueled by continued consumer interest in high quality coffee and related products 
our operations are vertically integrated 
we purchase high quality arabica coffee beans from countries around the world  and we utilize our artisan roasting technique to bring out the distinctive flavor of our coffees 
because roasted coffee is perishable  we are committed to delivering our coffee under the strictest freshness standards 
as a result  we do not stock or inventory roasted coffee 
we roast to order and ship fresh coffee daily to our stores and customers 
control of purchasing  roasting  packaging and distribution of our coffee allows us to maintain our commitment to freshness  is cost effective  and enhances our margins and profit potential 
our coffee  tea and related items are sold through two segments as defined under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segment of enterprise and related information sfas 
these segments are company operated retail outlets and specialty sales  consisting of home delivery on line and mail order  grocery  food service and office 
we evaluate segment performance primarily based on revenue and segment operating income 
the company s adoption of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r beginning july  is expected to have a significant effect on our financial statements 
management is still evaluating the methodology and assumptions for valuing share based payments 
the amount of expense that will be recognized in our financial statements will be dependent on these decisions 
we also have  options outstanding subject to acceleration provisions based on stock price appreciation that may result in expense recognition in periods earlier than anticipated 
since the company has used share based payments broadly across all employees  these expenses will be reported in cost of sales  operating  and general and administrative expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe our application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are periodically reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 

table of contents our accounting policies are more fully described in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies inventory 
raw materials consist primarily of green bean coffee 
finished goods include roasted coffee  tea  accessory products  spices and packaged foods 
all products are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method  except green bean and roasted coffee  which is valued at the average cost 
we continually evaluate the composition of our coffee related merchandise and mark down such inventory as needed 
our historical inventory write offs have been immaterial 
intangibles and other assets 
during  we entered into a contractual agreement with safeway  a national grocery chain  to sell peet s coffee through its grocery stores 
we began shipping during the third quarter of the agreement included an upfront payment to safeway that we recorded in intangibles and other assets and was amortized as a reduction of revenue based upon estimated sales during the contract period 
this amount was fully amortized as of january  long lived assets 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of long lived assets  we perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related long lived asset and reduce their carrying value by the excess  if any  of the result of such calculation 
we believe at this time that the long lived assets carrying values and useful lives continue to be appropriate 
accrued workers compensation 
in march  we modified our workers compensation insurance policy to a high deductible insurance program with an overall program ceiling to minimize exposure 
we began recording an estimated liability for the self insured portion of the workers compensation claims 
the liability of million recorded as of january  is determined based on information received from our insurance carrier including claims paid  filed and reserved for and historical experience 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the settlement costs increase beyond what was anticipated  the recorded liability may not be sufficient 
accrued litigation 
during  the company completed the payout pursuant to a settlement approved by the superior court of the state of california  county of orange  related to two lawsuits filed against the company entitled brian taraz  et al vs 
peet s coffee tea  inc  and tracy coffee  et al 
vs 
peet s coffee tea  inc on february  and march  these lawsuits alleged misclassification of employment position and sought damages  restitution  reclassification and attorneys fees and costs 
during  the company recorded a charge of million for the estimated payment of claims to eligible class members  attorneys fees and costs  costs to a third party claims administrator  as well as applicable employer payroll taxes 
during  based on the final settlement  fees  and costs incurred  the company recorded a benefit of  to general and administrative expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
there is no remaining liability recorded as of january  income taxes 
in establishing deferred income tax assets and liabilities  we make judgments and interpretations based on enacted tax laws and published tax guidance applicable to its operations 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities and evaluate the need for valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to realizable amounts 
changes in our valuation of the deferred tax assets or changes in the income tax provision may affect its annual effective income tax rate 
as of the date of the issuance of this report  we are concluding an internal revenue service audit related to our tax return and do not expect significant adjustments 
hedge accounting 
we have in the past used coffee futures and options to hedge price increases in price to be fixed coffee purchase commitments and anticipated coffee purchases 
these derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting 
if these derivative instruments did not qualify for hedge accounting  we would have to record the changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments directly to earnings 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note hedging activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

table of contents stock based compensation 
we have chosen to account for stock based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
information about the impact on our operating results of using the alternative of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  is included in note summary of significant accounting policies and note stock option and employee purchase plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
the company s adoption of sfas no 
r beginning july  is expected to have a significant effect on our financial statements 
lease accounting correction 
like other companies in the retail industry  peet s recently reviewed its accounting practices and policies with respect to leasing transactions 
following this review  we have corrected an error in our prior lease accounting practices to a record rent expense starting on the date we have the right to occupy the leased property  b conform the lease term used in calculating straight line rent expense with the term used to amortize improvements on leased property  and c straight line rent expense using the minimum stated escalation amount 
the total adjustment was  of which  related to prior periods 
the result of this correction is primarily to accelerate the recognition of rent expense under certain leases 
as the correction relates solely to accounting treatment  it does not affect historical or future cash flows or the timing of payments under the related leases 
it does not have a material effect on peet s current or prior years earnings per share  cash from operations and shareholders equity 
business segments our coffee and related items are sold through multiple channels of distribution that are considered separate segments under sfas no 
these channels provide broad market exposure to potential purchasers of fresh roasted whole bean coffee 
we are indifferent as to where consumers purchase our coffees and teas  and believe that our specialty and retail segments are synergistic 
however  we also recognize that the economics of our specialty business and retail stores are different enough that we have chosen to report them as separate channels 
therefore  we currently have two reportable segments  consisting of our retail stores  and specialty sales  which consist of sales to home delivery customers  sales to grocery stores  restaurant and food service companies and office accounts 
we believe growth opportunities exist in all these channels 
our expansion is focused geographically  not by segment 
our first priority is to develop the western us markets where we already have a presence and have higher customer awareness 
we will continue to open new stores in strategic locations that meet our demographic profile in these markets  make our coffees more broadly and conveniently located in grocery stores  and partner with distributors and companies who share our passion for quality and freshness and are willing and able to execute accordingly in the food service and office environment 
in future years  we also will penetrate new domestic markets and channels that we believe can support the sale of specialty coffee and continue to explore opportunities internationally 
business categories in addition to our reportable segments  we measure our business by monitoring the volume and revenue growth of two distinct business categories whole bean coffee and related products  consisting of products for home brewing  tea and packaged foods  and beverages and pastries 
we believe these business categories are useful in understanding our results of operations for the periods presented because we operate our stores and record sales through these two categories 
our stores are primarily 
table of contents designed to facilitate the sale of fresh whole bean coffee 
the format of our stores replicates that of a specialty grocer 
beans are freshly scooped from bins under the counter  weighed on counter top scales and hand packed into branded bags 
in addition  our stores are also designed to encourage customer trial of our coffee through coffee beverages 
each store has a beverage bar that is dedicated to the sale of prepared beverages and artisan baked pastries 
results of operations the following discussion on results of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected consolidated financial data  the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and the other financial data included elsewhere in this report 
our fiscal year is based on a or week year 
the fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to the last day of december 
statement of operations data as a percent of net revenue net revenue cost of sales and related occupancy expenses operating expenses marketing and advertising expenses general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization expenses income from operations interest income  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income percent of net revenue by business segment retail stores specialty sales percent of net revenue by business category whole bean coffee and related products beverages and pastries cost of sales and related occupancy expenses as a percent of segment revenue retail stores specialty sales operating expenses as a percent of segment revenue retail stores specialty sales percent increase decrease from prior year net revenue retail stores specialty sales cost of sales and related occupancy expenses operating expenses marketing and advertising expenses general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization expenses selected operating data number of retail stores in operation beginning of the period store openings store closures end of the period 
table of contents compared with net revenue net revenue for increased versus as a result of continued expansion of our retail and specialty sales segments and the impact of an extra week in fiscal year the increase from the same weeks was as the extra week accounted for 
sales of whole bean and related products increased to million 
sales from beverages and pastries increased to million 
a key element of our multi channel strategy emphasizes the sales of whole bean coffee and related products 
as a result  we continued to derive a majority of our net revenue from the sale of whole bean coffee and related products 
for  whole bean coffee and related products as a percent of net revenue was  slightly down from in the retail segment  revenue increased compared to  or without the rd week  primarily as a result of increased sales from the new stores we opened in the last two years and growth in the existing stores 
sales of whole bean coffee and related products in the retail segment increased by to million  while sales of beverages and pastries increased by to million 
the increase in beverage and pastry sales was primarily caused by sales at the stores we opened in and  increased traffic in our existing stores  and a revamped pastries program that emphasized our customers favorites 
the slower growth in whole bean and related products was due to cannibalization of bean sales in retail stores as we increased the availability of peet s coffee in grocery stores and the lower mix of whole bean sales in our new stores 
during  we opened a total of stores compared to in as part of our goal of accelerating sales growth to at least for and beyond  we will open approximately to stores in  all of them in the western united states 
in the specialty sales segment  revenue increased compared to  or without the rd week 
the million increase consisted primarily of a million increase in grocery sales and a million increase in sales to restaurants and food service companies 
the increase in both grocery and food service channel sales was primarily due to sales to new accounts we added as well and continued strong growth in our existing accounts 
in grocery  we added new stores during the year  bringing the number of grocery stores selling peet s coffee to  in the food service area  we selectively added new accounts such as san francisco international airport and the omni hotel in orlando 
sales to the home delivery channel  which includes online and mail order  grew compared to as we continued to emphasize loyalty programs that reward customers who subscribe to our recurring order programs 
in addition  office coffee sales increased primarily due to our effort to expand distributorships and the stabilizing office population as the job market and the economy recover 
cost of sales and related occupancy expenses cost of sales and related occupancy expenses consist of product costs  including manufacturing costs  rent and other occupancy and hedging costs 
as a percent of net revenue  cost of sales increased from in to in due to the cumulative adjustment of million  or of net revenue  related to lease accounting 
this adjustment  which increased occupancy expenses  was the result of our review of our lease accounting initiated by a letter released on february  by the sec 
upon review of all of our leases  we determined that our previous methods of accounting for rent holidays and specific rent escalation terms were not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
this correction does not impact the company s historic or future cash flow or the timing or amount of lease payments 
this increase as a percent of net revenue was partially offset by negotiated cost savings  waste reductions  and by the retail price increase we took at the end of october 
green coffee is our largest single cost of sales 
we do not purchase coffee on the commodity markets  but price movements in the markets do impact the price we pay 
over the past six months  the commodity cost for 
table of contents coffee has risen 
we currently have fixed price purchase commitments to meet our production needs for all of and a portion of and therefore we do not believe cost of sales will increase due to higher coffee prices in the short term 
however  sustained coffee cost increases could negatively impact our future cost of sales 
in the retail segment  cost of sales and related occupancy expenses as a percent of revenue were flat versus the prior year due to several offsetting items 
the lease accounting charge increased cost by 
the impact of opening more new stores  which have higher occupancy cost on a lower sales base  increased cost by 
these increases were slightly offset by better waste management and the price increase 
better waste management of pastries and packaging costs in our existing stores lowered costs by 
the price increase  which affected coffee  beverages and tea  lowered cost of sales by an additional 
in the specialty segment  cost of sales increased as a percent of net revenue compared to the prior year due to changes in sales mix 
operating expenses operating expenses as a percent of net revenue for increased compared to primarily due to the opening of new stores  partially offset by leverage gained in the specialty segment 
in the retail segment  operating expenses as a percent of sales increased by to 
the increase was due to a increase from opening new stores in the last two years 
new stores generally have higher operating expenses due to lower sales volume and startup costs 
the remaining increase was due to investments made in training  recruiting and real estate personnel to support store growth 
in addition  operating expenses were also higher due to increased health insurance  workers compensation coverage and equipment and building maintenance expenses 
as a percent of revenue  specialty operating expenses decreased as we leveraged the relatively fixed operating structure in all areas 
the leverage gained was primarily due to implementation costs incurred in for the dsd system 
marketing and advertising expenses for  marketing and advertising expenses decreased compared to the prior year 
we focus our marketing efforts primarily on new store openings and retaining existing customers in our home delivery channel 
the company does little media advertising  with most efforts focused on in store and direct to consumer marketing and acquiring new grocery customers 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased  or million  as compared to the decrease was due to the net difference of million associated with the wage and hour lawsuit and severance expenses 
in  we recorded million for these costs 
in  after the settlement was final and paid  we reversed million of the remaining reserve and recorded an offset to general and administrative expenses 
the impact on expenses as a percent of revenue was a decrease of to in  and an increase of to in offsetting the impact of these charges were increases in general and administrative expenses for investments in headcount to support our growth and higher audit and consulting fees to comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased in primarily due to the stores we opened during and this increase was partially offset by certain assets becoming fully depreciated during the year 

table of contents investment income  net we invest excess cash in interest bearing  us government  agency  municipal and guaranteed student loan obligations 
investment income includes interest income and gains from the sale of these instruments 
for  investment income decreased million  resulting from prior year gains of million compared to none this year  offset by minimal increases in interest income on similar cash and marketable securities balances 
income tax provision this year s corporate income tax rate was versus in the prior year 
our effective rate was reduced primarily by the removal of the valuation allowance on federal and state charitable contribution carryforwards and the tax benefit provided by shifting more of our investments into federal and state tax exempt securities 
we anticipate our effective tax rate to be approximately in compared with net revenue net revenue for increased versus as a result of continued expansion of our retail and specialty sales segments  mostly in the western united states 
sales of whole bean and related products increased to million 
sales from beverages and pastries increased to million 
whole bean coffee and related products as a percent of net revenue was in both and in the retail segment  revenue increased compared to primarily as a result of increased sales from new stores we opened during and and growth in existing stores 
sales of whole bean coffee and related products in the retail segment increased by to million  while sales of beverages and pastries increased by to million 
the increase in beverage and pastry sales is primarily due to the introduction  during the second quarter  of new iced drinks and a revamped bar menu that emphasized many of our customer favorites 
the slower growth in whole bean and related products was due to cannibalization of bean sales in retail stores as we increased the availability of peet s coffee in grocery stores  and the slower maturation of whole bean sales in new stores 
during  we opened a total of stores  an increase of from in the specialty sales segment  revenue increased as the result of our continued focus on the grocery and food service channels 
the million increase consisted primarily of a million increase in grocery sales and a million increase in sales to restaurants and food service companies 
the increase in the grocery channel sales was primarily due to sales to approximately  new stores we added during the last months 
during the second half of  we added approximately  safeway stores  of them in the western united states 
in  we added approximately  points of distribution  primarily in the western united states through multi location chains such as albertsons  ralph s  and whole foods market 
this brought the total number of grocery stores selling peet s coffee to over  at the end of the increased sales were also driven by the transition  during the first quarter  to a dsd system  where our own route sales representatives replaced warehouse distribution with weekly store delivery 
we believe the dsd system ensures freshness through proper rotation and weekly delivery  optimizes store specific item assortments  achieves proper shelf space and improves free standing display levels  thus increasing the unit sales in each grocery store 
in the restaurant and food service channel  the sales increase was primarily due to new accounts added last year and earlier this year such as omni hotels 
sales to the home delivery and office channels grew primarily due to more emphasis on loyalty programs and the stabilizing office population as the job market and the economy began to recover 
sales to kiosks and licensed partners  representing of net revenue  were down primarily due to our japan licensed partner ceasing its retail operation

specialty sales costs decreased as a percent of net revenue as compared to the prior year due to a favorable sales mix 
operating expenses operating expenses for increased as compared to as we grew our business 
operating expenses as a percent of net revenue increased primarily due to the opening of new stores and the transition to a dsd system to support growth in our grocery channel 
in the retail segment  operating expenses as a percent of sales increased by to 
the increase was due to a increase from opening new stores in the last months and was partially offset by a improvement in our existing store operation 
new stores generally have higher operating expenses due to lower sales volume and higher startup costs  including more activities to drive sales 
the improvement in existing operation was mainly due to leveraging our sales growth 
our focus on growing the specialty sales segment  especially grocery  led to an increase in specialty sales operating expenses as a percent of segment revenue 
the factors contributing to the increase included the continued upgrade and addition of sales staff and an increase in distribution costs in the grocery channel 
in the first quarter of  we implemented our dsd system with dedicated route sales representatives delivering our product to grocery stores weekly 
this increased our operating expenses in the areas of payroll  the associated commission and vehicle expenses 
the startup phase of this was completed by the second quarter 
in we had approximately dsd route sales representatives  of which were full time peet s employees 
marketing and advertising expenses for  marketing and advertising expenses were essentially in line with the prior year 
our focus had been to attract new customers in our new retail stores and in the grocery channel 
we were able to leverage marketing expenses in other channels 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased  or million  as compared to the increase was due to a million charge related to the settlement of a wage and hour lawsuit and million in severance expenses related to the departure of two veteran executives 
these charges  taken in the third quarter  reduced our full year diluted earnings per share by 
the increase was partially offset by the restructuring of the executive bonus program and reduced expenses in the areas of stock plan administration and proxy statement preparation related activities 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased in primarily due to the five stores we opened during the last five months of and the ten stores we opened in this increase was partially offset by certain assets becoming fully depreciated during the year

our taxable income was reduced primarily by the tax benefit provided by the exercise of stock options and acceleration of depreciation of fixed assets for tax purposes 
these tax benefits reduced our ability to release the valuation allowance on federal and state charitable contribution carryforwards in the current year  thus  increasing our tax rate

we are exploring capacity and office space needs as we continue to grow our business 
our primary lease for our corporate office and plant facilities expires in and we have an option to extend the lease for an additional ten years 
we believe that in we will need additional production and office space that will exceed our current facilities 
we are in the process of exploring alternatives including extending the existing lease with additional leasing of production  warehouse  and or office space

inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our results of operation in recent years 
however  we cannot predict what effect inflation may have on our results of operations in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairments and its application to certain investments eitf  but subsequently delayed the recognition and measurement provisions 
for reporting periods beginning after june   only the disclosure requirements for available for sale securities and cost method investments are required 
our adoption of the disclosure requirements did not have a significant effect on our financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas r 
fas r requires companies to use fair value to measure stock based compensation awards and cease using the intrinsic value method of accounting as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
compensation cost based on the fair value of the award will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period 
we expect to adopt the modified prospective application transition method beginning july  we are currently evaluating our valuation methodology and forfeiture rates  as well as various compensation strategies and have not determined the effect on future period financial statements 
we do not believe that the adoption of sfas r will have a significant impact on other matters or business practices  but will have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  sfas  an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material 
this statement requires that abnormal expenses be recognized in the current period and also introduces the concept of normal capacity to require the allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the statement is effective for the fiscal period beginning july  and we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a significant effect on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest excess cash in interest bearing  us government  agency  municipal and guaranteed student loan obligations 
these financial instruments are all subject to fluctuations of daily interest rates 
therefore our investment portfolio is exposed to market risk from these changes 
the supply and price of coffee are subject to significant volatility and can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries  including weather  political and economic conditions 
in addition  green coffee bean prices have been affected in the past  and may be affected in the future  by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence commodity prices of green coffee beans through agreements establishing export quotas or restricting coffee supplies worldwide 
we currently use fixed price purchase commitments  but in the past have used and may potentially in the future use coffee futures and coffee futures options to manage coffee supply and price risk 
fixed price purchase commitments we enter into fixed price purchase commitments in order to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee beans and fix our cost of green coffee beans 
these commitments are made with established coffee brokers and are denominated in us dollars 
as of january   we had approximately million in open fixed priced purchase commitments with delivery dates ranging from february through july we believe  based on relationships established with our suppliers that the risk of non delivery on such purchase commitments is low 
coffee futures and futures options we may use coffee futures and futures options to reduce the price risk of our coffee purchase requirements that we cannot make or have not made on a contractual basis 
these instruments are traded on the new york coffee  sugar cocoa exchange 
we use these futures and options solely for financial hedging purposes and never take actual delivery of the coffee traded on the exchange 
these derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting 
the effective portion of the gains and losses are accounted for as inventory costs and are recorded as expense or income when the related coffee is sold 
the ineffective portion is recorded as an expense or income immediately 
the extent of our coffee futures and coffee futures options positions at any given time depends on the amount of coffee we have contracted to purchase  the amount of coffee qualified for hedge accounting and general market conditions and trends 
our hedging positions are only placed by the chief financial officer through one brokerage firm that we believe to be reputable 
as of january   we held no coffee futures or futures options 
we had no outstanding positions at january  or december  we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 

table of contents risk factors we may not be successful in the implementation of our business strategy or our business strategy may not be successful  either of which will impede our growth and operating results 
our business strategy emphasizes expansion through multiple channels of distribution 
currently  our retail stores  which generated nearly of our net revenue  continue to be an important element of our business 
we do not know whether we will be able to successfully implement our business strategy or whether our business strategy will be successful 
our ability to implement this business strategy is dependent on our ability to market our products on a national or international scale and over the internet  enter into distribution and other strategic arrangements with third party retailers and other potential distributors of our coffee  increase our brand recognition on a national and international scale  identify and lease strategic locations suitable for new stores  and manage growth in administrative overhead and distribution costs likely to result from the planned expansion of our retail and non retail distribution channels 
our revenue may be adversely affected if we fail to implement our business strategy or if we divert resources to a business strategy that ultimately proves unsuccessful 
because our business is highly dependent on a single product  specialty coffee  if the demand for specialty coffee decreases  our business could suffer 
sales of specialty coffee constituted nearly of our net revenue 
demand for specialty coffee is affected by many factors  including consumer tastes and preferences  national  regional and local economic conditions  demographic trends  and perceived or actual health benefits or risks 
because we are highly dependent on consumer demand for specialty coffee  a shift in consumer preferences away from specialty coffee would harm our business more than if we had more diversified product offerings 
if customer demand for specialty coffee decreases  our sales would decrease accordingly 
if we fail to continue to develop and maintain our brand  our business could suffer 
we believe that maintaining and developing our brand is critical to our success and that the importance of brand recognition may increase as a result of competitors offering products similar to ours 
because the majority of our retail stores are located on the west coast  primarily in california  our brand recognition remains largely regional 
our brand building initiative involves increasing the availability of our products and opening new stores to increase awareness of our brand and create and maintain brand loyalty 
if our brand building initiative is unsuccessful  we may never recover the expenses incurred in connection with these efforts and we may be unable to increase our future revenue or implement our business strategy 
our success in promoting and enhancing the peet s brand will also depend on our ability to provide customers with high quality products and customer service 
although we take measures to ensure that we sell only fresh roasted whole bean coffee and that our retail employees properly prepare our coffee beverages  we 
table of contents have no control over our whole bean coffee products once purchased by customers 
accordingly  customers may prepare coffee from our whole bean coffee inconsistent with our standards  store our whole bean coffee for long periods of time or resell our whole bean coffee without our consent  which in each case  potentially affects the quality of the coffee prepared from our products 
if customers do not perceive our products and service to be of high quality  then the value of our brand may be diminished and  consequently  our ability to implement our business strategy may be adversely affected 
because our business is based primarily in california  a worsening of economic conditions  a decrease in consumer spending or a change in the competitive conditions in this market may substantially decrease our revenue and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategy 
our california retail stores generated of our net revenue and a substantial portion of the revenue from our other distribution channels is generated in california 
we expect that our california operations will continue to generate a substantial portion of our revenue 
in addition  our california retail stores provide us with means for increasing brand awareness  building customer loyalty and creating a premium specialty coffee brand 
as a result  an economic downturn or other decrease in consumer spending in california may not only lead to a substantial decrease in revenue  but may also adversely impact our ability to market our brand  build customer loyalty  or otherwise implement our business strategy 
labor conditions in the grocery business could negatively impact our grocery business 
there have been grocery strikes in the past that have negatively impacted our grocery business and it is possible that future grocery strikes in places where we have large distribution may adversely impact our grocery business 
if we are unable to continue leasing our retail locations or obtain leases for new stores  our existing operations and our ability to expand may be adversely affected 
all of our retail locations at year end are on leased premises 
if we are unable to renew these leases  our revenue and profits could suffer 
in addition  we intend to lease other premises in connection with the planned expansion of our retail operations 
because we compete with other retailers and restaurants for store sites and some landlords may grant exclusive locations to our competitors  we may not be able to obtain new leases or renew existing leases on acceptable terms 
this could adversely impact our revenue growth and brand building initiatives 
because we rely heavily on common carriers to ship our coffee on a daily basis  any disruption in their services or increase in shipping costs could adversely affect our business 
we rely on a number of common carriers to deliver coffee to our customers and retail stores 
we consider roasted coffee a perishable product and we rely on these common carriers to deliver fresh roasted coffee on a daily basis 
we have no control over these common carriers and the services provided by them may be interrupted as a result of labor shortages  contract disputes or other factors 
if we experience an interruption in these services  we may be unable to ship our coffee in a timely manner 
a delay in shipping could have an adverse impact on the quality of the coffee shipped  and thereby adversely affect our brand and reputation  result in the disposal of an amount of coffee that could not be shipped in a timely manner  and require us to contract with alternative  and possibly more expensive  common carriers 
any significant increase in shipping costs could lower our profit margins or force us to raise prices  which could cause our revenue and profits to suffer 

table of contents we depend on the expertise of key personnel 
if these individuals leave or change their role within our company without effective replacements  our operations may suffer 
the success of our business is dependent to a large degree on our management and our coffee roasters and purchasers 
if members of our management leave without effective replacements  our ability to implement our business strategy could be impaired 
if we lost the services of our coffee roasters and purchasers  our ability to source and purchase a sufficient supply of high quality coffee beans and roast coffee beans consistent with our quality standards could suffer 
in either case  our business and operations could be adversely affected 
we may not be able to hire or retain additional management and other personnel and our recruiting and training costs may increase as a result of turnover  both of which may increase our costs and reduce our profits and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategy 
the success of our business depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly motivated  well qualified management and other personnel  including technical personnel and retail employees 
we face significant competition in the recruitment of qualified employees 
our ability to execute our business strategy may suffer if we are unable to recruit or retain a sufficient number of qualified employees  the costs of employee compensation or benefits increase substantially  or the costs of outsourcing certain tasks to third party providers increase substantially 
we expend significant resources in training our retail managers and employees 
during the past few years  retail employee turnover has been approximately per year 
if turnover increases  we may incur additional recruiting and training costs 
because we have only one roasting facility  a significant interruption in the operation of this facility could potentially disrupt our operations 
we have only one coffee roasting and distribution facility 
a significant interruption in the operation of this facility  whether as a result of a natural disaster or other causes  could significantly impair our ability to operate our business 
moreover  our roasting and distribution facility and most of our stores are located near several major earthquake faults 
the impact of a major earthquake on our facilities  infrastructure and overall operations is difficult to predict and an earthquake could seriously disrupt our entire business 
our earthquake insurance covers net income  continuing normal operating expenses and extra expenses incurred during the period of restoration 
however  in the event of a catastrophic earthquake  our coverage is limited and we would incur additional expenses 
we have a high deductible workers compensation insurance program and more claims and higher costs from these claims may adversely affect our profit 
our current workers compensation insurance program is a modified self insured program with a high deductible with an overall program ceiling to limit exposure 
the california workers compensation environment has been unpredictable with continually increasing costs in the past five years 
the majority of our business is in california  therefore  we are exposed to the same increased costs 
additionally  we have had to estimate our liability for existing claims whose outcome is uncertain 
while we believe our reserve methodology on these claims is appropriate today  unfavorable development in this area will also affect any open claims that were filed beginning march  the date we transitioned to a high deductible program 
should a greater amount of claims occur or the settlement costs increase beyond what was anticipated  our expenses could increase and our profitability may decrease 

table of contents increases in the cost and decreases in availability of high quality arabica coffee beans could impact our profitability and growth of our business 
green coffee is our largest single cost of sales 
we do not purchase coffee on the commodity markets  but price movements in the trading of coffee do impact the price we pay 
over the past six months  the commodity cost for coffee has risen 
coffee is a trade commodity and  in general  its price can fluctuate depending on weather patterns in coffee producing countries  economic and political conditions affecting coffee producing countries  foreign currency fluctuations  and the ability of coffee producing countries to agree to export quotas 
if the cost of our green coffee beans increases due to any of these or other factors impacting us negatively  we many not be able to pass along those costs to our customers because of the competitive nature of the specialty coffee industry 
if we are unable to pass along increased coffee costs  our margin will decrease and our profitability will suffer accordingly 
if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of high quality arabica beans due to any of the above factors  we many not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee  our revenue may decrease and our ability to expand our business may also suffer 
our roasting methods are not proprietary  so competitors may be able to duplicate them  which could harm our competitive position 
we consider our roasting methods essential to the flavor and richness of our roasted whole bean coffee and  therefore  essential to our brand 
because we do not hold any patents for our roasting methods  it may be difficult for us to prevent competitors from copying our roasting methods 
if our competitors copy our roasting methods  the value of our brand may be diminished  and we may lose customers to our competitors 
in addition  competitors may be able to develop roasting methods that are more advanced than our roasting methods  which may also harm our competitive position 
competition in the specialty coffee market is intense and could affect our profitability 
competition in the specialty coffee market is becoming increasingly intense as relatively low barriers to entry encourage new competitors to enter the specialty coffee market 
our whole bean specialty coffee competes with several major national brands  such as gevalia kraft foods  green mountain coffee  illy caff  millstone procter gamble  seattle s best starbucks and starbucks  as well as numerous smaller  regional brands 
in addition  we compete indirectly against all other coffee brands on the market 
a number of nationwide coffee marketers  such as kraft foods  procter gamble and nestl  are distributing premium coffee brands in supermarkets 
these premium coffee brands may serve as substitutes for our whole bean coffee 
in addition to competing with other distributors of whole bean coffee  we compete with retailers of prepared beverages  including coffee house chains  such as starbucks and the coffee bean tea leaf  numerous convenience stores  restaurants  coffee shops and street vendors 
if we do not succeed in effectively differentiating ourselves from our competitors or our competitors adopt our strategies  then our competitive position will be weakened 
despite competing in a fragmented product category  whole bean specialty coffee brands are being established across multiple distribution channels 
several competitors have been aggressive in obtaining distribution in specialty grocery and gourmet food stores  through online and mail order and in office  restaurant and food service locations 
we have only recently begun to penetrate these channels 
other competitors may have an advantage over us based on their earlier entry into these distribution channels 
many of these new market entrants may have substantially greater financial  marketing and operating resources than us 
in addition  many of our existing competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing and operating resources than us 

table of contents lawsuits and other claims against the company may adversely affect our profitability 
we may from time to time become involved in certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business  such as the two lawsuits filed in against us entitled brian taraz  et al 
vs 
peet s coffee tea  inc  and tracy coffee  et al 
vs 
peet s coffee tea  inc in investigating any claims against the company or defending any allegations  we may incur legal fees  settlement fees  damages or remediation expenses that may harm our business  reducing our sales and adversely affecting our profitability 
adverse public or medical opinion about caffeine may harm our business 
our specialty coffee contains significant amounts of caffeine and other active compounds  the health effects of some of which are not fully understood 
a number of research studies conclude or suggest that excessive consumption of caffeine may lead to increased heart rate  nausea and vomiting  restlessness and anxiety  depression  headaches  tremors  sleeplessness and other adverse health effects 
an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in coffee could significantly reduce the demand for coffee  which could harm our business and reduce our sales and profits 
adverse publicity regarding customer complaints may harm our business 
we may be the subject of complaints or litigation from customers alleging beverage and food related illnesses  injuries suffered on the premises or other quality  health or operational concerns 
adverse publicity resulting from such allegations may materially adversely affect us  regardless of whether such allegations are true or whether we are ultimately held liable
