on october  we celebrated the th anniversary of our listing on the nasdaq exchange 
on december  we entered into an agreement to acquire from ppf an ownership interest in the tv nova czech republic group  which operates tv nova czech republic  the most watched television channel in central and eastern europe in terms of audience share the tv nova czech republic acquisition 
the principal operating companies of the tv nova czech republic group are cp  as  mag media as  and cet as cet 
in addition  on february   we entered into an agreement with peter krsak to acquire his entire ownership interest in cet  the company holding the broadcasting license for tv nova czech republic the krsak agreement for further information  see part i  item  operations by country  expected acquisitions 
future trends our board  after extensive discussions with both management and outside advisors in  agreed on a strategic plan to expand our business 
it was decided that our geographic focus would remain in central and eastern europe  and that our core business would remain television 
we identified three categories of development acquisition of additional ownership in our present operations  which is regarded as the strategy with the least risk due to our knowledge of these operations  acquisition of one or more established businesses in the balkans  particularly in the states of the former yugoslavia  which would allow us to capitalize on our success in slovenia  and acquisition of a broadcaster in one of the substantially larger markets of central or eastern europe  which would likely give rise to a significant increase in the scale of our business 
we achieved success in all three categories during the course of in march  we increased our interest in our romanian operations from to  in july  we acquired nova tv croatia  and on december   we entered into a definitive agreement with the ppf group to acquire a controlling interest in tv nova czech republic 
in  we will be focused on enhancing the performance of our croatian operations and on the completion of the tv nova czech republic acquisition and the integration of the tv nova czech republic group into our operations 
page we are planning on further investment in our croatian operations 
we expect to increase our audience share by acquiring higher quality programming and making additional strategic investments in local productions as well as by making limited capital investment in order to extend our technical reach 
we expect total investment to be in excess of us million 
in the czech republic we anticipate that we will complete the tv nova czech republic acquisition in the second quarter of a successful implementation of the krsak agreement in connection with the tv nova czech republic acquisition will allow us to terminate most of the litigation surrounding the tv nova czech republic group and simplify the ownership and operating structure of the tv nova czech republic group  which will facilitate the integration of the tv nova czech republic group into our operations 
the tv nova czech republic group reported total net revenues of us million  operating profit of us million and net income of us million 
for the twelve months ended december   the tv nova czech republic group reported a depreciation charge of us million and a net debt position of us million as at december  all of these figures are determined in accordance with us gaap 
the accounting policies used in compiling the combined accounts for the tv nova czech republic group may differ from those used by us  and the basis of combination of the entities included in the tv nova czech republic group may differ from the basis of consolidation that we apply to the inclusion of those entities in our accounts following completion 
with the addition of the tv nova czech republic group to our operations  we would be operating a business with estimated net revenues nearly two times our current levels and we would expect to generate significant positive net income and cash flow from our operations 
we will also have a large amount of debt on our balance sheet as a result of the tv nova czech republic acquisition including indebtedness of the tv nova czech republic group and the related financing 
however  we believe that the results of operations and our cash flows will be sufficient to meet our debt service obligations

general market information markets our revenue generating operations are located in central and eastern europe  namely croatia  romania  the slovak republic  slovenia and ukraine 
revenues primarily result from the sale of advertising time 
we  like other television operators  experience seasonality  with advertising sales tending to be lowest during the third quarter of each calendar year due to the summer holiday period typically july and august  and highest during the fourth quarter of each calendar year 
see part ii  item  quarterly results and seasonality for further discussion 
television advertising markets there is no objective source for reliable information on the size of television advertising spending in our markets 
the following table sets out our estimates of the development of advertising spending by market in us millions 
country croatia romania slovak republic slovenia ukraine page european union expansion slovenia and the slovak republic acceded to the european union eu in may it is currently anticipated that romania and croatia will accede after accession to the eu is likely to bring certain positive developments 
all countries joining the eu become subject to eu legislation and we believe that the ongoing progress towards eu entry reduces the political and economic risks of operating in the emerging markets of central and eastern europe 
the reduction in political risk factors may encourage increased foreign investment that will be supportive of economic growth 
accession to the eu may also bring certain negative developments 
the adoption of eu compliant legislation in connection with accession may result in the introduction of new standards affecting industry and employment and compliance with such new standards may require increased spending

analysis of segment results overview we manage our business on a country by country basis and review the performance of each business segment using data that reflects of operating and license company results 
our segments are comprised of croatia  romania  the slovak republic  slovenia and ukraine 
we evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment ebitda 
segment ebitda includes sts and markiza our operating and license companies in the slovak republic and certain romanian operations which are not consolidated under us gaap 
our key performance measure of the efficiency of our business segments is ebitda margin 
we define segment ebitda margin as the ratio of segment ebitda to segment net revenue 
we believe a segment ebitda margin can be achieved and sustained by each station 
our assets and liabilities are managed centrally and are reported internally in the same manner as the consolidated financial statements  consequently no additional segment information is provided in respect of assets and liabilities 
segment ebitda is determined as segment net income loss  which includes costs for program rights amortization  before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization of intangible assets 
items that are not allocated to our segments for purposes of evaluating their performance  and therefore are not included in segment ebitda  include expenses presented as corporate expenses in our consolidated statements of operations ie  corporate operating costs  stock based compensation and amortization of intangibles  changes in the fair value of derivatives  foreign currency exchange gains and losses  and certain unusual or infrequent items eg  extraordinary gains and losses  impairments on assets or investments 
we use segment ebitda as a component in determining management bonuses 
for a full reconciliation of our segment net revenues and segment ebitda by operation to our consolidated us gaap results for the years ended december   and see part ii  item  note  segment data 
a summary of our total segment net revenues  segment ebitda and segment ebitda margin showing the relative contribution of each segment  is as follows

most such contracts expired at the end of new management appointed in september continues to focus on converting revenues derived from barter to cash 
croatian segment ebitda for was a loss of us million which is substantially attributable to a lack of investment in quality programming during the first half of as well as the impact of advertising agreements entered into on unfavorable terms that were assumed at the completion of our acquisition of the croatian operations

pro tv  our main channel  and acasa  a cable channel  are ranked second and fourth in the market based on their national all day audience shares for of and  respectively 
the major competitors are the state channel tvr with a national all day audience share of and antena  a privately owned channel  with 
one of the reasons for tvr s higher all day audience share is that it is the only significant broadcaster with coverage across almost the entire country 
advertisers  however  evaluate audience share within a channel s coverage area and by this measure pro tv ranks first and acasa fourth of seven stations ranked in all day audience share 
both of our stations cover the important urban markets  which are targeted by advertisers 
in april our romanian operation launched a second cable channel pro cinema 
it had a national all day audience share of for net revenues for increased by over due to several factors 
the increase in revenues was primarily due to the growth in the television advertising market  which contributed approximately us million 
the balance of the increase in net revenues  approximately us million  was due to an increase in prices charged for advertising  additional inventory for advertising spots created by the launch of pro cinema and greater sales of inventory across all of our channels

the increase in amortization of acquired programming was the result of a combination of planned investment in more popular programming  an increase in the price of acquired programming and an increase in hours amortized due to the introduction of the new pro cinema channel 
other operating costs and expenses in increased by us million over mainly as a result of the increase in salary costs and bonuses

sources and uses of cash our ongoing source of cash in the operating stations is primarily the receipt of payments from advertisers and advertising agencies 
this may be supplemented from time to time by local borrowing 
surplus cash generated in this manner  after funding the ongoing station operations  may be remitted to us  or to other shareholders where appropriate 
surplus cash is remitted to us in the form of debt interest payments and capital repayments  dividends  and other distributions and loans from our subsidiaries and equity accounted investments 
the laws under which our operating companies are organized provide generally that dividends may be declared by the partners or shareholders out of yearly profits subject to the maintenance of registered capital  required reserves and after the recovery of accumulated losses 
in the case of our dutch and netherlands antilles subsidiaries  our voting power is sufficient to compel the making of distributions 
page in the case of nova tv croatia  distributions may be paid from net profits subject to a reserve of of annual profits until the aggregate reserves equal of the registered capital of nova tv croatia 
in the case of pro tv  distributions may be paid from the profits of pro tv subject to a reserve of of annual profits until the aggregate reserves equal of pro tv s registered capital 
a majority vote is required in order for pro tv to make distributions and we have sufficient voting power to compel distributions of dividends 
in the case of sts  distributions may be paid from net profits subject to an initial reserve requirement of of net profits until the reserve fund equals of registered capital 
subsequently  the reserve requirement is equal to of net profits until the reserve fund equals of registered capital 
we cannot compel the distributions of dividends by sts 
in the case of pro plus  distributions may be paid from the profits of pro plus  subject to a reserve equal to of registered capital being established from accumulated profits 
we have a sufficient majority to compel distributions of dividends from pro plus 
in the case of innova and ims  distributions may be paid from their profits and there is no reserve requirement for either company 
our voting power in innova and ims is sufficient to compel the distribution of dividends 
sts has made dividend distributions to us in and  pro plus has made dividend distributions to us in as at december  and the operations had the following unsecured balances owing to their respective holding companies country as at december  us s croatia romania slovak republic slovenia ukraine total in  our romanian balances were restructured to facilitate repatriation of certain amounts provided to our romanian operations 
this had the effect of reducing the receivable by an amount of approximately us million that will be recovered through interest charges over the remaining term 
prior to making investments in associated companies  borrowing or repayment of third party overdraft or debt  or payments to us in excess of current year recharges  our continuing consolidated operating stations generated cash of us million in compared to us million in the decrease in net cash paid to us is primarily due to negative cash flows arising out of our new croatian operations in and higher capital investment and income tax payments 
sts  our equity accounted affiliate  generated cash of us million in us million 
cash outlook our future cash needs will depend on our overall financial performance  the completion of the tv nova czech republic acquisition as well as any future investment and development decisions 
we anticipate completing the tv nova czech republic acquisition  which will include closing a transaction for external financing that will be required to fund this acquisition  during the first half of we believe that  taken together  our current cash balances  the proposed external financing  internally generated cash flow and local financing of broadcast operations should result in us having adequate cash resources to meet our debt service and other financial obligations for the next months 
in july we acquired nova tv croatia 
we are also planning on further investment in our croatian operations 
we anticipate that we can increase our audience share by acquiring higher quality programming and making additional strategic investments in local productions as well as by limited capital investment in order to extend our technical reach 
we expect total investment to be in excess of us million 
page on december  we entered into a definitive agreement with ppf to acquire an ownership interest in the tv nova czech republic group in the czech republic 
we expect the closing of the acquisition of the tv nova czech republic group to occur during the second quarter of on february   we entered into the krsak agreement  which provides for our acquiring the interest of mr 
krsak in cet we expect the transfer of the krsak interest to us to occur during the third quarter of the aggregate purchase price for the tv nova czech republic acquisition and the interest of mr 
krsak in cet is estimated to be approximately us million  consisting of us million in cash and the issuance of million shares of our class a common stock to ppf 
the purchase price is subject to adjustments for changes in the debt and working capital levels of the tv nova czech republic group between the signing date and the closing date of the tv nova czech republic acquisition 
see risk factors and operations by country  expected acquisitions in part i  item following the completion of the tv nova czech republic acquisition and the transfer of mr 
krsak s interest in cet to us  we will have an attributable interest of at least in the economics of the tv nova czech republic group 
we have a call right on the remaining interest in the tv nova czech republic group held by ppf that is exercisable at any time after the closing date of the tv nova czech republic acquisition 
the call price is capped and will not exceed of the adjusted purchase price for the tv nova czech republic acquisition  subject to certain adjustments and other terms 
it is estimated that the call price will be approximately us million 
ppf has a right to put to us its interest in the tv nova czech republic group  exercisable from the first anniversary of the closing date of the tv nova czech republic acquisition for an exercise price that is the lesser of i of the independently appraised value of the tv nova czech republic business at the time of the exercise of the put and ii of the adjusted purchase price of the tv nova czech republic acquisition  subject to certain adjustments and other terms 
the closing of the tv nova czech republic acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions  including receipt of an approval from the office for the protection of economic competition of the czech republic

both we and ppf are subject to a payment of a fee of us million if either side fails to satisfy the conditions to closing as defined in the framework agreement 
the krsak agreement is also subject to a number of conditions  including the consent of the council of the czech republic for radio and television broadcasting  and the consent of the general meeting of cet to the transfer of mr 
krsak s interest to us and the withdrawal of all outstanding legal proceedings by mr 
krsak relating to the tv nova czech republic business 
a failure by one of the parties to fulfill conditions under the krsak agreement may result in penalty payments being assessed against such party or may allow the other party to terminate the agreement 
in addition  the failure to obtain third party consents within the prescribed time periods may result in the termination of the krsak agreement 
external financing of approximately us million will be required to fund the tv nova czech republic acquisition 
we have received a commitment from a consortium of banks to provide a bridge loan of us million 
financing of approximately us million will be required to fund the exercise price of the ppf call 
we intend to secure permanent financing through a public or private offering of debt or equity 
the bridge facility will be secured and contain restrictive covenants 
if we are unable to obtain permanent financing and draw down on the bridge facility  the interest rate will increase each quarter beginning six months from the initial drawdown date and significant penalty conditions would be incurred in the event the bridge loan is not repaid within one year 
page the completion of the tv nova czech republic acquisition  the purchase of the krsak interest and the exercise of the ppf call and the related financings will increase our leverage and we will have significant debt service obligations 
in addition  the terms of our indebtedness will restrict the manner in which our business is conducted  including the incurrence of additional indebtedness  the making of investments  the payment of dividends or the making of other distributions  entering into certain affiliate transactions and the sale of assets 
with the drawdown of any bridge facility or the completion of a public or private offering of equity or debt in connection with the completion of the tv nova czech republic acquisition or  if exercised  the ppf call  we would continue to expect that cash balances  internally generated cash flow and local financing of broadcast operations should result in us having adequate cash resources to meet our debt service and other financial obligations for the next months

critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies affecting our financial condition and results of operations are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements that are included in part ii  item of this form k 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make judgments in selecting appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates  which inherently contain some degree of uncertainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements program rights cost program rights costs consists of programming acquired from third parties and programming produced locally and forms an important component of our station broadcasting schedules 
these program rights costs are amortized on a systematic basis over their expected useful lives 
during we initiated a review of our program rights cost policy 
effective from october  we changed our amortization policy 
the policy was changed after a comprehensive examination of past periods ratings allocation to both first and second runs 
in the first quarters the film licenses were amortized after the first run and after the second run 
series were amortized after the first run in proportion to the numbers of shows 
in the last quarter  after the change  both films and series are amortized after the first run and after the second run 
the impact of the change is a lower amortization charge of approximately us million for the year page valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets we have acquired significant intangible assets that are valued and recorded 
intangible assets include goodwill  broadcast license costs license acquisition costs and trademarks  all of which are not amortized under fas no 
we assess the carrying value of these assets on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying value may not be recoverable 
other than our annual review  factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review are under performance of projected results  changes in the manner of utilization of the asset  and negative market conditions or economic trends 
our annual assessment of the carrying value of an intangible asset not subject to amortization is based on discounted future cash flows 
when an impairment review is undertaken  whether it be our annual assessment or if events or changes in circumstances indicate such carrying value may not be recoverable  certain variables are utilized in determining cash flows discount rates  terminal values  the number of years on which to base the cash flow projections as well as the assumptions and estimates used to determine the cash inflows and outflows 
we believe that our assumptions are appropriate 
we have  in addition  acquired intangible assets that are subject to amortization during these consist of customer relationships and were valued as part of the increase in our ownership of our romanian operations 
we determined these customer relationships to have a finite life and will be amortizing them over years 
an impairment of an intangible asset  subject to amortization  may occur if events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with fas no 
bad debt provision we maintain a bad debt provision for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate additional allowances may be required in future periods 
we periodically review the accounts receivable balances and our historical bad debt  customer concentrations and customer creditworthiness when evaluating the adequacy of our provision 
deferred tax we recognize deferred tax assets if it is probable that sufficient taxable income will be available in future periods against which the temporary differences and unused tax losses can be utilized 
we have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing whether deferred tax assets should be recognized
