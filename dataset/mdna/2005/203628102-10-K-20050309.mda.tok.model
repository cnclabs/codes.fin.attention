item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion of financial condition and results of operations this discussion is being presented to provide a narrative explanation of the financial statements of community 
the purpose of this presentation is to enhance the overall financial disclosure and to provide information about historic financial performance as a means to assess to what extent past performance can be used to evaluate the prospects for future performance 
throughout this presentation  net income and yield on earning assets have been presented on a tax equivalent basis and balances represent average daily balances unless otherwise indicated 
all dollar amounts  except per share information  are presented in thousands  unless otherwise indicated 
forward looking statements periodically  community has made and will continue to make statements that may include forward looking information 
community cautions that forward looking information disseminated through financial presentations should not be construed as guarantees of future performance 
furthermore  actual results may differ from expectations contained in such forward looking information as a result of factors that are not predictable 
financial performance can be affected by any number of factors that are not predictable or are out of management s direct control 
examples include o the effect of prevailing economic conditions  o unforeseen or dramatic changes in the general interest rate environment  o actions or changes in policies of the federal reserve board and other government agencies  and o business risk associated with the management of the credit extension function and fiduciary activities 
each of these factors could affect estimates  assumptions  uncertainties and risks used to develop forward looking information  and could cause actual results to differ materially from management s expectations regarding future performance 
critical accounting policies management believes that the application of its accounting policies and procedures in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses and in the evaluation of other than temporary impairment of investment securities should be considered to be critical accounting policies to ensure the fair presentation of community s financial statements 
o community applies a systemic methodology in order to estimate the allowance for loan losses 
this methodology incorporates management s judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio through a disciplined process that is consistently applied 
this process requires that a detailed analysis of the loan portfolio be performed on a quarterly basis 
this analysis includes a specific individual loan review for any and all loans that meet specific materiality criteria 
such loans are evaluated for impairment under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the portfolio is further stratified to analyze groups of homogenous loans with similar risk characteristics 
such loans are evaluated under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
management considers all known relevant internal and external factors that may affect loan collectibility  as well as particular risks indigenous to specific types of lending 
the process is further designed to consolidate the aggregate loss estimates and to ensure that the allowance for loan losses is recorded in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the final results are reviewed and approved by executive management 
results are constantly validated by a review of trends associated with loan volume  delinquencies  potential concentrations  or other factors that may influence the methodology used to estimate the allowance for loan losses 
o investment securities are written down to their net realizable value when there is an impairment in value that is considered to be other than temporary 
the determination of whether or not other than temporary impairment exists is a matter of judgment 
management reviews these investment securities regularly for possible impairment that is other than temporary by analyzing the facts and circumstances of each investment and the expectations for that investment s performance 
other than temporary impairment in the value of an investment may be indicated by the length of time and the extent to which market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  or the intent and ability of community to retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
a summary of the review and application of these critical accounting policies is included later in this discussion and in the notes to the audited financial statements 
performance summary the year is destined to go down as a milestone period in the history of community 
the reliable delivery of strong profit performance  combined with the execution of critical efforts to facilitate meaningful franchise expansion  is expected to distinguish community among its competitors and provide a solid foundation for future growth and expansion 
net income reached million  a increase from the net income of million reported in similarly  earnings per share reached per share  a improvement from the reported in return on average assets roa and return on average equity roe provide traditional benchmarks used to compare the relative operating performance of financial service companies 
at the end of  community produced an roa of and an roe of  which was comparable to the performances of and  respectively  in the prior year 
community produced improved levels of profitability during by driving higher loan and deposit volumes  increased fees  strong asset quality and more modest growth in operating expenses 
across the broader financial services spectrum  profit performance was directly and indirectly influenced by the depressed level of interest rates and an unsettled national economy 
rates have remained lodged near their lowest levels in decades and  when combined with competitive pressures  produced enduring margin compression and lingering constraints on net interest income growth 
net interest income  which is defined as the difference between interest income from earning assets and interest expense on funding sources  remains the largest single source of revenue for most community banks 
the strain on net interest income growth placed a premium on increasing market share  maintaining pristine asset quality metrics  developing new and improved sources of service fee income  and unrelenting vigilance on the achievement of operating efficiencies 
all of these factors contributed to community s improved profit performance in the progress achieved in these areas served to offset the impact of interest rate compression on revenue expansion and facilitated earnings growth in an uncertain economic environment 
at the same time  community continued to make strategic investments in expanded operating platforms and delivery channels to support and serve a larger  more profitable financial services operation 
identifying opportunities for franchise expansion continued to be a primary objective for community throughout the year 
on november   community announced its pending combination with pennrock financial services corp  the parent of blue ball national bank 
this affiliation will be the single largest merger in community s history 
pennrock  with assets in excess of billion  serves three important counties within the south central region of pennsylvania through its office locations 
on a combined basis  the community pennrock affiliation will have a combined network of nearly offices and over billion in assets and will serve twelve counties containing over million households 
operations will extend from the pocono region of northern pennsylvania to just across the maryland border  with an enviable presence in the vibrant south central region of pennsylvania 
the combined franchise is expected to become the th largest bank holding company headquartered in pennsylvania 
the future for this new and exciting partnership will be built on a mutual history of sustained profitability and responsible leadership  both of which were aptly demonstrated during future performance comparisons assuming that the companies complete the merger after receiving the necessary regulatory and shareholder approvals  community will be recording the merger of pennrock under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations  which is now required under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
traditional measures of performance  like net income  earnings per share  and return on assets will continue to be presented  but comparability between post consummation results and prior years will require careful scrutiny 
the most noticeable effect will be that community s historical operating results and statements of condition will not be restated for the impact of the pennrock acquisition for periods prior to consummation 
pennrock results will only be included on a prospective basis  commencing at the date of consummation  which is expected to occur in mid the comparability of other measures  such as roe  will be dramatically affected due to the introduction of concepts which are unique to the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations 
for example  community will recognize certain intangible assets to the extent that the value of the common stock exchanged with former pennrock shareholders exceeds the book value of net tangible assets acquired in the transaction 
the introduction of more substantial levels of intangibles arising from the pennrock acquisition will make historic comparisons of roe between and prior periods more difficult to interpret and assess 
many of community s peers and competitors have also experienced growth through acquisitions that were completed after the mandatory imposition of the purchase method of accounting 
in response to these comparability challenges  many financial institutions have adjusted certain performance measurements in order to facilitate meaningful comparisons of performance within the financial services industry 
future presentations of community s financial performance will consider these adjusted measures 
for example  earnings results will be reported in both the traditional net income format as well as the operating income format 
the operating income format will measure earnings by excluding certain non operating expenses such as core deposit intangible amortization and merger related expenses 
additionally  traditional roe comparisons will be augmented with a measure called return on average tangible equity rote  which seeks to eliminate the distortion in comparability that arises from the accounting implications of acquired intangible assets 
to the extent such measures are considered non gaap measures of performance  community will be required to provide reconciliations designed to highlight and explain the nature of the differences between traditional gaap measures and those that are considered non gaap 
the presentations provided in this discussion will require no gaap non gaap reconciliations 
the scarcity of significant acquisition activity at community since the mandated imposition of the purchase accounting method would yield few noticeable differences between gaap and non gaap measures in  or in comparable earlier periods 
consequently  most results and comparisons in this analysis are presented on a gaap basis  unless otherwise indicated 
performance review the primary driver of performance in was growth  more specifically  loan and deposit growth 
while the opportunity for improved pricing and expanded interest spread was undermined by the compression of interest rates  community s ability to achieve organic growth  which includes market share penetration  resulted in an expansion of net interest income 
community benefited from marketing efforts in its core markets and from its position as one of the larger franchises to sustain a deliberate and concentrated focus on central pennsylvania 
community s customers  as well as new  influential employees formerly associated with larger competitors have been attracted to its local peoplelocal decisions philosophy 
that operating principle was in stark contrast to larger competitors  which often appear less intensely focused on local markets or seem distracted by the potential for opportunities in new or acquired markets 
average loans grew and deposits rose and such growth contributed substantially to a increase in net interest income 
the continued expansion of banking service offerings also provided an increase to revenue in the form of higher non interest income 
for example  the more widespread acceptance of the overdrafthonor program and the success of other fee based product distribution initiatives  including annuity sales  brokerage services and insurance related commissions  provided measurable revenue expansion and income stream diversification 
during the first half of the year  community also recorded substantial increases in gains from the sale of portfolio securities  primarily gains from the sale of bank stocks 
these gains reflected opportunities to benefit from the favorable valuations of bank equity securities  particularly early in recognition of these gains was coordinated with expanded marketing efforts to increase the visibility of the community franchise 
in the third quarter  community also decided to sell its credit card portfolio and recognized a gain of thousand 
the maturity of the mono line credit card industry  combined with the relatively small size of community s portfolio  created overwhelming competitive and scale disadvantages that precipitated the sale 
lessening the effect of these gains and other revenue expansion trends in non interest income was the impact of subdued mortgage refinancing activity 
industry wide  gains and fees from home mortgage refinancing declined as previous pent up demand was largely satisfied in recent years 
at the same time  purchase activity waned in the wake of a tepid economy and the concern over higher interest rates 
as a result of these external factors  growth in mortgage banking revenue was not as great as in prior years 
growth in complementary fee based activities  such as title and settlement services  also lessened  due in some measure to the outsized mortgage origination activity experienced in previous years 
the net effect of all of these trends was a increase in income from non interest sources excluding security gains  and an increase excluding nonrecurring gains from both years 
two highlights of performance related to asset quality and control over non interest expenses 
community has now experienced two consecutive years of steadily improving metrics in loan quality  including net charge offs to loans of only in at the same time  the coverage of problem credits provided by the allowance reached 
as a consequence of these favorable trends  the provision for loan losses grew modestly  despite substantial growth in loan balances 
non interest expenses were adversely impacted by increased marketing efforts  including both image and product specific advertising  each of which was designed to increase community s visibility within its core markets 
community  like most publicly traded companies  also experienced another layer of regulatory burden in the form of compliance costs arising out of the sarbanes oxley act of sox 
the most recent wave of requirements resulted in increased costs associated with section of sox  which mandated detailed review  documentation and testing of internal controls over financial reporting  and required completion by the end of despite these challenges  overall operating expenses grew only modestly as a result of close management of incremental spending during concern over the impact of a compressed margin and less robust non interest revenue projections in areas like mortgage banking necessitated more proactive and strategic cost control efforts  including temporary delays of office openings originally planned for economic climate in many ways  economic conditions in reflected an extended version of issues that had influenced results 
a new reality has evolved from the increased global and domestic threats of terrorism 
it began with the attack of september  and continued with the current occupation of iraq  and the seemingly endless hostility in that region of the world 
this new reality  combined with a sluggish domestic economy  became the dominant issues confronting the country during the presidential election year 
for most businesses  the fallout from these challenges was exacerbated by previous corporate scandals that ultimately gave rise to the compliance  testing  and oversight provisions of sox 
the nation continues to recover and build upon the progress that has been made in coping with these external factors  but the economy in many parts of the country remains uninspiring 
the federal reserve maintained its accommodative posture on interest rates for most of  although subtle changes began to emerge over the course of the year 
productivity improvements  from both technological advances and inexpensive labor costs from the new  more globally driven economy  served to restrain inflationary pressures and supported a stance of continued low interest rates 
the federal reserve s posture was also a reflection of its focus on providing ongoing support to economic activity 
despite the precipitous rise in energy prices and a steadily weakening dollar  the federal reserve pursued a restrained mid year reversal to its accommodative monetary policy 
the federal reserve began the year with a federal funds target of percent and ended the year with an increase of basis points to percent by the end of this tightening  while directionally significant  did not dramatically alter the interest rate landscape for most financial institutions as most long term rates experienced little or no upward pressure 
since the end of  interest rates have moved gradually from low rates and a steep yield curve to slightly higher rates and a flatter yield curve 
this steady flattening of the yield curve often has been viewed as an unfavorable bellwether for financial institutions 
the relatively low rate environment experienced in both and continued to provide a healthy stimulus for credit services  while consumer expectations for higher deposit rates supported a continuous flow of liquidity into transaction accounts 
this trend corresponded with consumer resistance to locking up funds in longer term certificates of deposit that provided only modest rate incentives for customers to extend maturities 
the pressure on net interest income was exacerbated by the inability to achieve significantly higher loan pricing or to incrementally reduce funding costs to expand net interest spread 
as a consequence  overall interest spreads remained substantially comparable with in summary  the economic climate during was mixed  yielding no definitive or compelling arguments for either an imminent  robust expansion or a near term recessionary slowdown 
community operates within a regional economy  and smaller local economies  that have performed with comparative consistency  seemingly less vulnerable to major boom or bust cycles that often influence other  more cycle dependent regions of the country 
the mature yet diverse economic underpinnings of community s service area have been less predisposed to broad expansions or deep slumps triggered by national or international economic and political trends 
while these local economies have been characterized by their reliability  the existence of overarching trends will always have some causal effect on regional economies 
the businesses and individual customers within community s markets remain exposed to these pervasive economic developments  but are characterized most often by their comparative stability 
that stability has been attributed to many factors  including an absence of single industry concentrations  relatively modest deviations in local employment trends  and steady profitability performance 
in recent years  the influence of these factors on local economies has contributed considerably to the sound financial performance of community banks 
emerging issues for the single dominant internal issue for will be the planning and execution of the successful integration of the community and pennrock operations 
the first half of will be dedicated to the coordination and harmonization of policies  procedures and practices  and to the construction of an operating platform that will facilitate the combination of these historically successful franchises 
during this process  both entities will maintain a concentrated focus on the creation of an overall operating platform capable of serving an even larger  more diverse franchise 
this effort will culminate in the consolidation of most back office operations  including information technology  loan and deposit operations  and an array of administrative functions 
prior to consummation and throughout much of  community will incur and recognize certain non operating expenses that will arise as a direct consequence of the merger 
these expenses will include various retention  conversion and severance benefits to be incurred by community to ensure fair and equitable remuneration for employees who are displaced or inconvenienced by the efforts to combine and integrate the two companies 
community will also incur certain other merger based expenses directly related to the overall combination initiative 
appropriate accounting recognition will be made in order to segregate the impact of each of these items on results and provide a clear picture of the operating performance of the newly formed community banks franchise 
during  however  the highest priority will be placed on the following o minimizing the impact of the combination effort on the convenient  effective  and efficient delivery of products and service to new and existing customers  and  o maintaining the highest possible levels of profitability and operating efficiency for all of our stakeholders  including both existing shareholders and those shareholders added through our pennrock affiliation 
while a great deal of management attention will be devoted to the combination of the community and pennrock franchises  these two priorities will remain corporate imperatives for and beyond 
net interest income community s major source of revenue continues to be derived from intermediation activities through its bank subsidiary and is reported as net interest income 
net interest income is defined as the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest margin is a relative measure of a financial institution s ability to efficiently deliver net interest income from a given level of earning assets 
both net interest income and net interest margin are influenced by the frequency  velocity  and extent of interest rate changes and by the composition and absolute volumes of earning assets and funding sources 
the following table compares net interest income and net interest margin components between and change yield yield yield amount rate amount rate amount rate interest income    interest expense   net interest income    interest spread impact of non interest funds net interest margin interest rates for the first time since  average interest rates rose 
when examined on an average basis  such increases were comparatively modest and slightly more conspicuous at the short end and middle segments of the yield curve 
in each of the last three years  it was assumed that rates had declined to levels at  or near  the trough in the interest rate cycle 
in each of those years  despite predictions for a gradual rise in interest rates  downward pressure remained 
for most of that three year period  declines in short term rates outpaced the declines in the long end of the curve  producing an increasingly steep yield curve 
during  such trends began to reverse  producing modest upward pressure on short term rates and a comparatively flatter yield curve 
the following graph provides a comparison of average us treasury rates for the key maturity intervals for both and the preceding year 
average us treasury curve months months year year year year year a more perceptible change in the direction of interest rates emerges from a comparison of the one day interest rates in effect at december for each of the past two years 
this comparison  unlike the presentation of average rates  displays rates in place at discrete points in time 
such comparisons tend to provide a less revealing overview of trends  largely because they exclude the more inclusive influence of average rate comparisons and because rates are  by definition  vulnerable to one day swings 
the following graph demonstrates the comparative results provided by a presentation of the yield curve at the end of both and year over year us treasury curve months months year year year year year despite its inherent limitations  the above graph does provide an illustration of the incremental pricing challenges that emerged during and the impending challenges likely to be confronted by financial institutions into this presentation reveals the comparatively modest interest rate premium available at the long end of the curve 
when coupled with the flatness of the curve  this trend tends to diminish the bank s appetite for extending maturities on credit facilities or portfolio investments in order to improve yields 
extending maturities or granting favorable  long term pricing concessions close to the low end of the rate cycle may prove to be problematic if long term rates were to subsequently tighten  thus restoring a steeper yield curve 
on the funding side  the consumer s enthusiasm for extending maturities into longer term certificates of deposits is also diminished near the apparent bottom of the interest rate cycle 
most importantly  if a flat yield curve is in place for an extended period of time  it has the potential to yield additional compression in net interest spread and net interest margin 
despite these challenges  community reported little volatility in net interest margin and actually recorded overall improvement in net interest income when comparing and results 
interest income from earning assets grew while interest expense from the various funding sources increased by  resulting in an increase in net interest income of 
interest income earning assets interest income was million in and grew by million as compared to the million recorded in this represented growth of and was achieved despite the fact that earning asset yields declined from in to in from to  earning assets grew million  including million in loans 
such growth was offset by a slight decline in investment portfolio balances 
growth in loans accelerated during the year and was funded by normal runoff in the investment portfolio and by a million increase in the level of deposits  primarily in community s successful power checking offering 
as in recent years  loan growth was focused in the commercial and commercial real estate categories and was augmented by continued penetration of the consumer home equity market 
interest expense funding sources interest expense grew modestly during the year despite the overall growth in funding sources 
the overall cost of funding  like the yield on earning assets  declined from in to in this decline in the relative cost of funds substantially offset the impact of increased funding levels on interest expense growth 
interest expense rose from million in to just million in  a modest change of only million 
total interest bearing funding grew by million and  combined with the growth in non interest funds  provided substantially all of the funding needed for the million in loan growth 
as was the case in  community s longer term  time deposit growth patterns were relatively flat throughout most of the year as consumer preferences were weighted in favor of maintaining adequate liquidity in anticipation of an impending rise in interest rates 
consumer preferences for liquidity and flexibility resulted in an increase in community s popular power checking account offering  which grew by million and was the primary driver of overall deposit growth 
community continued to make strategic use of other forms of funding in order to meet the consistent demand for credit extension that occurred throughout the year 
during the year  community made efforts to strategically realign its balance sheet composition in preparation for the onset of higher interest rates 
to this end  community gradually reduced its dependence on selected short term funding sources  such as overnight fed funds  which are sensitive to increases in short term interest rates 
at various times during the year  community also increased its long term borrowings  which are composed principally of term funding available through the federal home loan bank programs  an important source of liquidity that is accessed pursuant to risk parameters set forth in community s asset liability management alco policies and procedures 
this strategy permitted community to lock in longer term funds at or near a potential trough in the interest rate cycle 
community experienced a increase in long term funding  which totaled million at the end of  and included two million subordinated debt instruments issued in equal amounts at the end of both and the issuances were integrated with  and responsive to  the overall capital management policy discussed later in this presentation 
interest spread and net interest margin a financial institution s ability to effectively blend the impact of changing rates  shifting rate indices  customer preferences  and product development initiatives can be measured by the performance of interest spread  defined as the difference between earning asset yield and the cost of funding sources 
net interest margin combines the impact of interest spread with both investment of non interest bearing funding sources and management of non earning assets 
as a result of rate trends and other dynamics specific to community s balance sheet  community reported a modest decline in net interest spread from in to in  and a decline in net interest margin from to over the same period 
the decline in margin was also linked to the impact of reduced contribution from non interest funding sources  which declined from to 
during periods of declining interest rates  the contribution from non interest funds to net interest margin is reduced since funds are invested at progressively lower rates 
during periods of rising rates  these funds can be expected to contribute to improvements in net interest margin 
quarterly performance the following table provides a comparison of earning asset yields  funding costs  and other information for each of the four quarters of and fourth third second first quarter quarter quarter quarter asset yield funding cost interest spread net interest margin net interest margin     fourth third second first quarter quarter quarter quarter asset yield funding cost interest spread net interest margin net interest margin     quarterly net interest income and net interest margin trends for both and reflected many of the same characteristics noted in the comparisons of full year performance 
since the beginning of  interest rates continued their steady pattern of decline through the midpoint of this drove a corresponding compression of net interest margin  and a practical constraint on community s ability to reflect more substantial increases in net interest income to accompany its impressive balance sheet growth 
for the most part  community experienced relatively modest improvement in net interest income on a sequential quarter basis throughout most of and near mid year  the fed began to slowly reverse its accommodative monetary policy 
the pace of the policy reversal was slowly reflected in the increases in yields on earning assets and cost of funding sources in the third and fourth quarters of  though both net interest spread and net interest margin remained compressed 
by the end of the year  a more measurable improvement in pricing began to emerge as both net interest spread and net interest margin appeared to recover  albeit modestly  from the nadir of performance reported in the first quarter of  when margin reached only 
in the fourth quarter of  community recorded its highest quarterly net interest margin in the two year period 
provision for credit losses one of the high points for the banking industry  and specifically for community  was the ongoing stability of the credit quality picture throughout these trends have been largely sustained over a two year period  even as community has continued to experience dramatic loan growth over that same period 
the provision for loan losses was million  which was only slightly higher than the provision of million recorded in the relationship of the allowance to loan losses declined  albeit modestly  from in to in the provision and the allowance are recorded at levels which are responsive to both the ebb and flow of general credit quality patterns and  more specifically  to the risks inherent in both seasoned loans and in incremental additions to community s growing portfolio 
community undergoes a rigorous and consistently applied process on a quarterly basis in order to evaluate the allowance for loan losses and the determination of the quarterly provision for credit losses 
net charge offs during were only million or of average loans 
non accrual loans aggregated just million  and remained near the lowest levels in community s more recent history 
one of the more important measures of credit quality is the coverage of non accrual loans provided by the allowance 
at december   this ratio reached compared to at the end of see the section of this discussion which addresses the allowance for loan losses and asset quality for additional information 
non interest income generation of increased levels of non interest income continues to be an integral component of community s operating strategy 
the development or acquisition of new financial service offerings  combined with the enhancement and expansion of traditional fee based banking services  have been the catalysts for steady growth in this vital revenue source 
results for both and were influenced by the impact of gains from security transactions and by certain non recurring transactions 
total non interest revenues grew from to aggregate revenues reached million versus million  inclusive of gains from sales of securities 
excluding the financial impact of both security gains and non recurring revenues  comparisons of non interest income between and resulted in a increase in adjusted non interest income 
non interest income adjusted for these items now accounts for of total revenues  which is defined as the sum of tax equivalent net interest income and non interest income 
the following presentation provides a comparative summary  adjusted for security gains and non recurring items  of non interest income between and change amount investment management and trust services   service charges on deposit accounts    other service charges  commissions and fees   insurance premium income and commissions   mortgage banking activities   earnings on investment in life insurance   other income excluding non recurring other income non recurring gain on branch sale   pension curtailment gain on sale of credit card portfolio subtotal    investment security gains   total non interest income    investment management and trust revenues include fees derived from the sale of various retail investment products annuities  brokerage services  mutual funds  etc as well as fees related to community s trust department activities 
sales of investment products are facilitated under an arrangement with a national provider of these services 
consultative sales are conducted through the community office network 
this arrangement provides convenient access to alternative investment vehicles through licensed employees who live and work in the communities where customers conduct their normal banking business 
this service has facilitated a more comprehensive approach to meeting the expanding financial service needs of customers who live within community s footprint 
customers are increasingly comfortable with using trusted  competent employees who work under the umbrella of their primary financial institutions for this vital service 
trust revenues  which are primarily driven by fees derived from the administration of personal trust accounts  also experienced more vibrant growth during late in community announced its affiliated arrangement with bryn mawr trust company  pursuant to which a more competitive investment management product menu could be offered to new customers 
a number of initiatives were executed in in furtherance of leveraging this unique relationship and will continue into in the first quarter of  community began to provide a new product offering which was branded as overdrafthonor 
under the benefits provided from this service  demand deposit customers can avoid the adverse credit implications of the occasional inadvertent overdraft situation and simultaneously facilitate timely payment of overdraft items 
since its introduction  community has experienced steady increases in the fees derived from this service with a modest increase in related credit losses 
such growth was related to a number of factors the heightened consumer awareness of the benefits of this service  increased product utilization  and the overall growth in the number of demand deposit accounts 
while community expects to continue to record increased fees from this service in  it is anticipated that the pace of growth will moderate from current levels as the product matures and is more fully saturated within the core customer base 
the vast majority of the million increase in service charges on deposit accounts was derived from fees associated with this service 
the remainder was due to increases in the fee structure for this and more traditional overdraft fees 
other service charges include letter of credit fees  credit card interchange income and safe deposit rentals 
the most significant volume of fees in this category  however  are derived from interchange fees from community s atm network and from debit card transactions  which together provide nearly two thirds of the total of million in fees 
community continues to maintain an atm network of nearly atms  including those in place under a relationship with a local convenience store chain operating within community s geographic footprint 
transaction counts for non customer use of the network have remained constant despite a full year increase in the standard fee charged for foreign transactions 
the more substantial increase was realized in the interchange fees associated with retail transactions conducted via the use of debit cards 
these charges aggregated nearly million in annual fees  resulting in a increase over nearly all of the increases in these sources of fee income resulted from increased usage and the consumer s continuing acceptance of these electronic mediums to augment cash or check based transactions 
community has conducted promotional campaigns to encourage the use of debit card transactions versus traditional check transactions 
insurance premiums and commissions include agency based commissions from commercial and personal lines  fees from credit reinsurance activities related to consumer lending  and the revenue from title insurance and settlement activities conducted through community s title insurance subsidiary  the sentinel agency  llc sentinel 
during  community consummated acquisitions of abco april   which is now a division of sentinel  and your insurance partner october   an insurance agency 
the year represented the first full year of combined operations from these acquisitions and fueled a increase in commissions 
growth in commissions was constrained  however  as title activity declined in a manner that correlated with the decline in mortgage refinancing activity  an important catalyst for increases in title insurance services 
mortgage banking activities in were adversely impacted by the decline in mortgage refinancing  which had experienced a dramatic upturn for the last two to three years 
the steady decline in the rates offered on fixed rate single family homes had spurred an extraordinary level of refinancing activity 
although represented the first full year of activity since the acquisition of erie financial group  ltd 
erie  such activity was hampered by the fact that much of the pent up demand for mortgage refinancing had been satisfied in previous years 
revenues from mortgage banking activities  primarily from brokerage activities  grew to just million compared to million in  a rather modest increase of in the first full year of combined operations of erie and community 
earnings on investment in life insurance represent the increase in cash value of bank owned life insurance boli policies 
the boli policies of community are designed to offset costs of supplemental retirement plans and life insurance for selected executives and to partially offset the costs of employee benefit plans including health  group life and disability insurance 
income from boli totaled million in and million in the investment in boli totaled million and million at december  and earnings on boli are affected by fluctuations in interest rates and provide a tax free return to community 
the comparison of non recurring income provided in the chart on page isolates the financial impact of the pension curtailment and branch sale which occurred in and the gain from the sale of the credit card portfolio in during  community analyzed the competitive issues surrounding the viability of maintaining its credit card portfolio in a business line increasingly driven by the advantages of scale 
such analysis was considerate of the competitive challenges presented by the large mono line credit card providers versus the potential for meaningful expansion of community s current customer base 
although credit cards will continue to be offered to customers via an outsource arrangement  community sold its portfolio in the third quarter of and realized a gain of  gains from the sale of investment securities totaled million and increased by nearly thousand between and the majority of gains related to sales of equity holdings in bank stocks  the majority of which occurred in the first half of the year 
during that time  community had also embarked on a simultaneous marketing campaign that focused on increasing its visibility in core markets and certain product specific advertising 
this resulted in higher marketing expenditures  particularly in the second quarter of non interest expenses aggregate non interest expenses grew to million in compared to in  an increase of million or nearly 
the pace of growth in non interest expenses was influenced by additional expenses from those businesses acquired in that were integrated with existing financial service activities 
because represented the first full year of operations for these businesses abco  your insurance partner  erie  half of the growth in non interest expenses was directly attributable to the incremental expenses of these businesses incurred from partial year to full year 
the following table summarizes the expenses incurred during the last two years and isolates the year over year changes into its two components  those from new businesses and those from on going operations dollars in thousands change change new other total new other total salaries and employee benefits      net occupancy expense   marketing expense   telecommunications expense   other operating expense   total      bifurcation of the increases in non interest expenses into two distinct categories facilitated identification of the sources of the million increase by isolating the impact of acquired businesses 
changes in the absolute dollar amount were found to be equally influenced by the impact of acquired businesses and the annual increases in the on going operating expense categories 
excluding the growth attributed to the full year absorption of expenses associated with acquired businesses  adjusted year over year increases totaled million  reflecting a more modest increase in operating expenses from the single largest component of costs is salary and benefits  as these expenses represent nearly of total operating costs 
excluding the impact of salaries added from the acquired businesses  salary and benefit expenses grew million during during  the average increase for merit bonuses approximated 
however  a number of other factors influenced significant changes in the composition of salary and benefit expenses 
o migratory changes have occurred in the compensation structure  particularly in sales related positions  whereby portions of individual compensation have become more heavily weighted toward incentive based pay 
this approach  particularly in areas such as mortgage banking  reduced the dependence on guaranteed compensation and increased reliance on a pay for performance compensation structure 
o increases in group insurance costs for were less severe than national trends  primarily due to unusual competitive pressures from insurance carriers operating within community s markets 
it is expected that conditions that gave rise to these favorable conditions will abate during  and are likely to result in increases more consistent with national trends 
o participation by acquired employees in community s discretionary incentive and retirement programs fueled a disproportionate increase in benefits expense 
combined benefit costs related to incentive and retirement programs rose to million in  a increase from and included a more generous discretionary contribution to the employee retirement plan and the impact of expanded participation in the management bonus pool 
amounts provided under each of these plans are dependent on the achievement of pre defined performance goals 
excluding the impact of acquired businesses  the increase in the total count of full time equivalent employees by the end of was negligible  nearly equal to the number in place at the end of more focused efforts to monitor and manage staffing increases yielded substantial control over staff additions during the year 
community has historically followed the intrinsic value accounting method of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  which was permitted under sfas no  accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
all options issued by community have been issued at fair value and  accordingly  no compensation expense has been recognized in the financial statements for stock options issued to employees  executive officers or directors through the end of as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  community has provided the required pro forma disclosures of the impact of stock compensation on net income and earnings per share by applying the fair value recognition provisions of sfas in december of  the fasb issued sfas no r  share based payment sfas r  which amended sfas and will now require financial statement recognition of compensation cost for stock options and other stock based awards for fiscal periods beginning after june  community is currently evaluating the various provisions of sfas r and the optional transition methods that may be applied when adopting this new accounting standard 
it is expected that community will adopt the modified prospective method  which requires recognition of compensation expense for the unvested portion of existing awards and new grants  but does not require a restatement of prior periods 
additionally  it is also expected that the company and its board of directors  through its compensation committee  will review and evaluate the continuing role of stock based compensation in its overall compensation structure in light of these changes in prescribed accounting 
pending the decisions of the compensation committee  the ability to estimate the impact of any new options grants to be issued in periods beginning after june  will be affected by the outcome of those decisions 
the vesting of existing option grants will not have a material impact on the financial statements in the last half of or in years beyond as would be expected  occupancy expenses were also influenced by the full year impact of offices added during community delayed the opening of a limited number of offices that were scheduled to be opened in delays in new office openings were affected by a number of factors related to the approvals and timing of new office construction 
increased rentals included carrying costs for land leases executed in advance of the completion of office construction that enabled community to secure prime locations expected to go on line in the increase in occupancy expense was also influenced by service contracts associated with technology related initiatives 
during the last two years  community expanded its marketing expenditures and the communication channels used to reach its base of customers and non customers 
these efforts have complemented the introduction of new office locations within core markets in past years 
these efforts also coincided with a more cohesive and strategic branding approach designed to take advantage of the disruption caused by the acquisitions of several well known  local financial institutions that compete with community on a day to day basis 
this elevated marketing focus has contributed to an increase in overall visibility and has generated the momentum needed for core franchise growth and an increased share of market 
telecommunications expenses were elevated in due to the costs of upgrades for communications and data connectivity improvements for community s growing office network 
during  community underwent an intensive study with an outside vendor specializing in the review and analysis of telecommunications strategy 
these efforts identified cost savings which moderated telecommunications expense in and are expected to continue to do so into other operating costs remained relatively stable between and increases were almost entirely related to the first full year of expenses associated with acquired businesses during income taxes income taxes grew from million in to million in  an increase of nearly 
the increase was commensurate with the increase in pretax income  resulting in an effective tax rate of approximately in both years 
the relative rate of tax exempt income influences the reported income tax rates and remains the primary reason for the difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory federal tax rate for corporations 
balance sheet overview at december   community s total assets reached billion  reflecting a change of from the billion of assets recorded at the end of average assets reached billion for compared to billion for  resulting in growth of from growth in average assets was fueled by a nearly increase in average loans 
the disparity in growth from average loans versus the growth in average assets was influenced by investment balances  which actually declined between the two periods 
the liquidity provided by runoff of the investment portfolio combined with a increase in deposits to provide the funding necessary to absorb the accelerated growth in the loan portfolio 
community benefited from increased demand for credit in both the consumer and commercial sectors 
while consumer demand for credit was influenced by both low rates and sustained consumer confidence  growth in the commercial sector was more directly related to community s ability to garner market share from larger  less nimble financial institutions 
the growth trends experienced in each of the last two years provide a validation of community s commitment to staying close to its core markets and to using its local presence and responsiveness as a competitive advantage 
investments community has established corporate investment policies that address various aspects of portfolio management  including quality standards  liquidity and maturity limits  investment concentrations and regulatory guidelines 
community s objective with respect to investment management includes maintenance of appropriate asset liquidity  facilitation of asset liability strategy and maximization of return 
compliance with investment policy is regularly reported to the board of directors 
community actively manages its investment portfolio and  accordingly  classifies all investment securities as available for sale 
under current policy  if management has the intent and community has the ability to hold securities until maturity  securities are classified as held to maturity investments at the time of purchase and carried at adjusted historical cost 
securities to be held for indefinite periods of time are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value 
such securities are intended to be used as part of community s asset liability management strategy  and may be sold in response to changes in interest rates  prepayment risk and other factors affecting overall investment strategy 
over the last year  balance sheet dynamics have reflected only modest changes in the investment portfolio as liquidity from scheduled maturity or cash flow runoff was often redeployed into the loan portfolio in order to satisfy the steady demand for credit facilities 
during  the average balance in the investment portfolio was reduced from million to million  a decrease of 
this decrease followed two consecutive years of double digit growth in investment portfolio balances when the generation of funding sources  including increases in deposit balances  provided funding in excess of amounts needed to keep pace with loan demand 
as loan demand continued to increase in  scheduled runoff in the investment portfolio was utilized to provide the additional liquidity needed to meet customer credit needs  forestalling growth in the investment portfolio 
from to  the relative mix of investments to earning assets dropped from to  while the mix of loans to earning assets grew from to 
this shift also served to bolster earning asset yields as the loan portfolio provided a higher yield premium by comparison to alternate investment portfolio yields 
the pretax unrealized net gain within the investment portfolio at december  was million 
as required  this fair value adjustment was recorded in other comprehensive income adjusted for income taxes in the stockholders equity section of the statement of condition 
as previously discussed  all securities included in community s investment portfolio are classified as available for sale 
securities totaling million have a fair value that exceeded the adjusted historical cost  with unrealized pretax gains totaling million 
alternatively  the portfolio also included million of investments that have a fair value less than the adjusted historical cost  including unrealized losses of million 
special consideration was given to those securities which were affected by unrealized losses to ensure the losses were temporary 
in early  the emerging issues task force eitf addressed the issue of accounting for impairments of certain investments in debt and equity securities in eitf this authoritative guidance sought to clarify existing recognition and measurement principles to be applied to valuation impairments of securities for reporting periods beginning after june  in december of  this new guidance was temporarily deferred to enable the financial accounting standards board fasb additional time to further deliberate on the impact of this guidance 
in concert with the delay  companies holding investments were encouraged to apply existing guidance for other than temporary impairments in evaluating the realizable value of investments with unrealized losses 
specifically  companies were encouraged to perform an assessment for those securities in an unrealized loss position and were to determine whether that impairment was other than temporary 
in performing this assessment  it was suggested that companies review several factors in assessing the possibility of an other than temporary impairment 
factors to be considered included  but were not limited to  the following o the length of time and the extent to which market value has been less than cost  o the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  o the intent and ability of the holder to retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
in those instances whereby community had identified securities which reflected unrealized losses  a systematic methodology was applied in order to perform an assessment of the potential for other than temporary impairment 
the aggregate portfolio of million included million of investment securities with unrealized losses totaling million 
of that amount  million of securities  with an unrealized loss of million  had been impaired for a period exceeding one year 
management believes that these unrealized losses were entirely attributable to changes in interest rates in periods subsequent to the acquisition of the specific securities  and did not reflect any deterioration of the credit worthiness of the issuing entities 
generally  those securities with unrealized loss included in community s portfolio are debt securities of investment grade or are equity securities with characteristics of debt securities  including a specific repricing date 
in all cases  it was determined that investments that were to be considered for other than temporary impairment had a specified maturity or repricing date  were generally expected to be redeemed at par  and were expected to achieve a recovery in market value within a reasonable period of time 
consequently  the impairments identified and subjected to the assessment were deemed to be temporary and required no further adjustment to the financial statements

change amount commercial    commercial real estate    residential real estate    consumer    total    for the last several years  community has focused on leveraging its position as one of the larger financial institutions that remains headquartered in central pennsylvania 
community has improved its visibility within its core markets  particularly in the commercial and commercial real estate sectors 
the addition of experienced lenders with long term ties to the business communities in these markets has enhanced community s profile and increased its access to commercial lending opportunities 
brisk activity in construction and land development lending as well as traditional consumer real estate financing fueled the substantial increases in these categories 
commercial lending activity continues to be driven almost exclusively by in market transactions 
community has also increased the volume of lending to various governmental bodies within its market as the creation of a governmental banking unit has increased its focus in this sector 
at the same time  efforts were also made to become a more competitive consumer lender within community s footprint 
during  promotions for revolving home equity lines of credit with preferential terms created significant interest and generated substantial increases in consumer lending opportunities and expansion of customer relationships 
increases were also noted in the volume of home equity loans with specified terms 
community has centralized the administration and oversight of consumer lending activities which has produced a more strategic approach to expansion of activity in the consumer lending sector 
residential real estate lending  which is composed primarily of loans to single family creditors  has experienced a steady decline as a result of the increasing accessibility of secondary market liquidity through mortgage banking activities 
community based banks continue to provide a convenient avenue for consumers to access funding for residential lending  but most fixed rate  conforming mortgages continue to be sold in the secondary market 
this strategy has reduced the interest rate risk associated with consumer preferences for long term  fixed rate lending  and provided valuable liquidity for other forms of relationship lending 
allowance for loan losses and credit quality the following sets forth activity within the allowance for loan losses for the last three years dollars in thousands 
balance at january     loans charged off    recoveries    provision charged to operations    balance at december     allowance for credit losses to loans for the last two years  the credit quality profile of community banks has shown substantial improvement despite significant growth in loans  growth that was particularly evident in the commercial and commercial real estate sectors 
the ratio of net charge offs to loans for and was and  respectively 
in the two years prior to  net charge off levels were more than double those amounts 
this performance was particularly notable because aggregate loan balances increased in and in  providing some indication of the relative quality of loans being added to the portfolio over these periods 
community also monitors the level of the coverage of non accrual loans provided by the allowance for loan losses 
at december   the allowance provided times coverage of those loans included as non accrual loans 
at the end of  this same ratio was times 
these measures  as well as a number of other key measures  serve to demonstrate the continuing improvement in the overall credit quality profile of the loan portfolio 
the following sets forth loan loss experience for the last five years loans at year end      average loans balance      balance  allowance for loan losses  january loans charged off commercial  financial and agricultural   real estate commercial mortgage    real estate retail mortgage consumer and other     total      loans recovered commercial  financial and agricultural real estate commercial mortgage real estate retail mortgage consumer and other total    net charge offs      provision for loan losses      balance  allowance for loan losses  december      net charge offs to loans at year end net charge offs to average loans balance of allowance for loan losses to loans at year end prior breakouts of historical information could not be readily reconstructed from predecessor banks records 
breakouts from to are assumed to approximate current mix trends 
the ratio of the allowance to loans declined modestly from at the end of to at the end of this decline occurred despite a million increase in the absolute balance of the allowance  which grew from million at the end of to million at the end of the decline in the ratio of the allowance to loans was primarily attributed to the rapid increase in loan balances 
this increase influenced the increase in the provision for loan losses  which rose from million to million even as the level of identified problem loans declined 
the allowance for loan losses is based upon management s continuing evaluation of the loan portfolio 
a review as to loan quality  current macro economic conditions and delinquency status is performed on a quarterly basis 
the provision for loan losses is adjusted quarterly based upon current review 
the following table presents an allocation by loan categories of the allowance for loan losses at december for the last five years 
loans commercial  financial and agricultural      real estate construction real estate mortgage     installment      unallocated     balance      the amount of the allowance assigned to each component of the loan portfolio is derived from a combination of factors 
estimation methods and assumptions used in the process are reviewed periodically by both management and the board of directors 
community s allowance for loan losses is based upon management s quarterly review of the loan portfolio utilizing a consistent valuation methodology 
the purpose of the review is to assess loan quality  identify impaired loans  analyze delinquencies  ascertain loan growth  evaluate potential charge offs and recoveries  and assess general economic conditions in the markets served 
commercial and commercial real estate loans are individually risk rated by community s loan officers and periodically reviewed by independent loan review personnel 
consumer and residential real estate loans are generally analyzed in homogeneous pools utilizing historical loan charge off information 
to determine the allowance and corresponding loan loss provision  an amount is allocated to specific loans 
for certain commercial and construction loans  this amount is based upon specific borrower data and supporting collateral determined by reviewing individual non performing  delinquent  or potentially troubled credits 
for the majority of the loans that are individually reviewed for impairment  this analysis is based on a comparison of the loan s carrying amount to the net realizable value of the collateral 
the portion of the allowance attributable to specific impaired loans was thousand at december  the remaining commercial as well as consumer  and residential real estate loans are evaluated as part of various pools 
these pool reserves  generally are based upon historic charge offs and delinquency history  other known trends and expected losses over the remaining lives of these loans  as well as the condition of local  regional and national economies and other qualitative factors 
to ensure adequacy to a higher degree of confidence  a portion of the allowance for loan losses is considered unallocated 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable  for possible imprecise estimates in assessing potential losses on commercial loans or in the calculation of pool reserves  and for the extenuating influence of current factors  such as economic uncertainties 
this unallocated portion is available to absorb losses sustained anywhere within the loan portfolio 
the combined allocated and unallocated portions bring the total allowance to an amount deemed prudent and reasonable by management at that time 
risk elements the following sets forth information regarding various segments of the loan portfolio  collectively referred to as risk elements 
these segments include both nonperforming assets and those loans past due for days or more 
non performing assets include non accrual loans  restructurings  and other real estate 
non accrual loans are loans for which interest income is not accrued due to concerns about the collection of interest and or principal 
restructured loans may involve renegotiated interest rates  repayment terms  or both  because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower 
the only credits that would have qualified as restructured loans at the end of both years were already classified in the more severe non accrual category 
the following table provides a comparative summary of nonperforming assets and total risk elements at the end of each of the last five years 
loans on which accrual of interest has been discontinued commercial  financial and agricultural      mortgages      other  loans renegotiated with borrowers total non accrual loans      foreclosed real estate    total non performing assets      loans past due days or more commercial  financial and agricultural  mortgages consumer and other total risk elements      ending allowance for loan losses      ending allowance to non accrual loans despite improvement in most categories of problem credits  there was a substantial increase in foreclosed real estate from to the balance in this category grew from million at december  to million at the end of nearly all of the increase was related to the reclassification of two large credits that had been made to a single borrower 
pursuant to the provisions of the original loan agreements  community took possession of two collateral properties in the fourth quarter of  due to borrower default 
a new  unrelated borrower purchased one of the properties in january   resulting in the return of nearly million of loans to accrual status 
amounts included in foreclosed real estate are stated at the lower of cost or market and no losses are expected from the final disposition of these properties 
the determination to discontinue the accrual of interest on non performing loans is made on the individual case basis 
such factors as the character and size of the loan  quality of the collateral and the historical creditworthiness of the borrower and or guarantors are considered by management in assessing the collectibility of such amounts 
the approximate amount that would have been accrued on those loans for which interest was discontinued in was  overall assessment community has assessed all of the above factors in the establishment of the allowance for loan losses 
the determination as to the adequacy of the allowance reflects management s judgment  and was based upon collateral  local market conditions  various estimates  and other information that requires subjective analysis 
these factors  which are prone to change  are monitored by management to evaluate their potential impact on management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance 
based on its evaluation of loan quality  management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december  was adequate to absorb probable losses within the loan portfolio 
deposits deposit balances remain the primary source of funding for financial institutions and community recognized steady growth of nearly in this important core funding source  with average balances summarized as follows change amount demand    savings now accounts    time    time  or more    as in  deposit trends were influenced by consumer preferences for liquidity 
the scarcity of opportunities available to achieve higher returns by extending maturities stunted growth in most time deposit categories 
deposit growth in was concentrated in savings deposits  more specifically community s power checking account 
this account  which has characteristics of both a money market and checking account  has grown steadily throughout both and consumer preferences were clearly weighted in favor of maintaining adequate liquidity in anticipation of a future increase in rates 
this was influenced  in part  by concerns over the presidential election and any possible impact that may have on expectations for the pace and velocity of chances in interest rates 
despite the fact that most interest rates declined steadily through mid year  most depositors were reluctant to extend time deposit maturities to obtain only marginally higher rates 
the consistent downward pressure on rates  combined with lack of confidence in other more risky investment vehicles  increased consumer preference for the flexibility  liquidity and guaranteed return provided by these accounts 
the following table summarizes the maturity distribution of time deposits of  or more as of december  remaining time to maturity less than three months  three months to six months  six months to twelve months  more than twelve months  borrowed funds community makes tactical use of federal home loan bank fhlb advances and other borrowed funds to augment its funding needs 
the largest component of borrowed funds comes from fhlb advances 
fhlb borrowings  which are collateralized by residential mortgages or other qualified securities  include a variety of credit products available to community through its membership in the federal home loan bank 
at december   the amount available for borrowing under fhlb arrangements totaled million 
the use of advances and borrowed funds is a by product of community s overall asset liability management strategy and is influenced by a number of factors  which are discussed more fully in the section titled asset liability management and liquidity 
capital adequacy capital strength is an important measure with which to judge the overall stability of a financial institution 
a strong capital base is a prerequisite for sustaining franchise growth through both internal expansion and strategic acquisition opportunities 
regulatory authorities impose constraints and restrictions on bank capital levels that are designed to help ensure the vitality of the nation s banking system 
community believes that capital is a valuable  albeit limited resource whose availability moderates with changes in the business cycle 
community has developed an extensive capital management policy designed to consider all aspects of capital management 
this policy is mindful of the responsibilities to community s shareholders  employees  regulators  and other constituencies to ensure that capital is well managed 
the policy considers the impact of numerous capital management issues  including the maintenance of key financial ratios  the need for an adequate return to shareholders in terms of both dividend payout and capital appreciation  the flexibility to apply techniques that will accommodate either equity expansion or contraction  and the restraint required to avoid accumulation of unsustainable levels of intangible assets 
community also continuously examines its options with regard to capital management in the context of intrinsic factors  including its prospects for growth  the potential for earnings disruption  and others 
maintenance of appropriate capital levels may require the application of techniques designed to help community meet or exceed regulatory guidelines and to correlate capital levels with a given asset growth rate 
community s capital management and planning process is reviewed and approved by its board of directors 
in addition to internal guidelines  regulators have established standards for the monitoring and maintenance of appropriate levels of capital for financial institutions 
all regulatory capital guidelines are based upon a risk based supervisory approach that has been designed to ensure effective management of capital levels and associated business risk 
the following table provides the risk based capital positions of community and its bank subsidiary at the end of  along with an indication of the various regulatory capital requirements 
december  well regulatory capitalized minimums leverage ratio community banks  inc n a bank only tier capital ratio community banks  inc n a bank only total risk based capital ratio community banks  inc n a bank only the most fundamental source of capital is earnings and earnings retention 
this cornerstone of capital adequacy can be augmented by a number of capital management strategies 
throughout the year  community s earnings trends supported a return of capital to existing shareholders in the form of the traditional cash dividend 
community also made strategic use of share repurchase as another efficient means of returning capital to shareholders 
at the end of both and  community executed separate issuances of million of subordinated debentures and the total subordinated debentures balances remained at million as of the end of community places no significant reliance on these instruments to meet regulatory capital requirements 
in the aggregate  these various strategies and techniques have allowed management to maintain capital at levels that represented an efficient use of this valuable resource 
community does not presently have any commitments for significant capital expenditures 
asset liability management and liquidity the process by which financial institutions manage earning assets and funding sources under different interest rate environments is called asset liability management 
the primary goal of asset liability management is to increase net interest income through the prudent control of market risk  liquidity  interest rate risk and capital 
two important barometers of performance are net interest margin and liquidity 
net interest margin is increased by widening interest spread while controlling interest rate sensitivity 
the adequacy of liquidity is determined by the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of both depositors and customers requesting bank credit 
community s board of directors and the audit committee of the board govern and monitor asset liability management processes and liquidity as part of the overall risk management process and delegate the responsibility for management of these processes to the corporate asset liability management committee alco 
liquidity is defined as the ability to meet maturing obligations and customers demand for funds on a continuous basis 
good liquidity exists when an entity can meet its potential cash obligations without liquidating its franchise assets 
poor liquidity exists when a company lacks the liquid assets to cover short term liabilities 
liquidity is sustained by stable core deposits  a diversified mix of liabilities  strong credit perception and the presence of sufficient assets convertible to cash without material loss or disruption of normal operations 
bank liquidity could contract from current comparatively strong positions if there were reversals in trends that contributed to recent deposit growth 
community actively manages liquidity within a defined range and has developed reasonable liquidity contingency plans  ensuring availability of alternate funding sources to maintain adequate liquidity under a variety of business conditions 
community s investing and financing activities are conducted within the overall constraints of its liquidity management policy and practices 
community utilizes a variety of techniques to assist management and the board of directors in the management and monitoring of interest rate risk 
in order to quantify the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income  community conducts a quarterly interest rate shock simulation that projects the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income over the next year 
these simulations are utilized to assess whether management should consider corrective actions in order to minimize community s exposure or vulnerability to a particular trend in interest rates 
management has established acceptable tolerance limits for the impact of changes in interest rates on the volatility of net interest income  and is authorized to pursue mitigating strategies in order to minimize unfavorable impact under a variety of scenarios 
such simulations are conducted under a variety of assumptions that require estimates of the velocity and extent of interest rate changes  including an assessment of the impact of such changes on those assets and liabilities that have indeterminate maturity or repricing characteristics 
simulation of earnings is used primarily to measure community s earning exposure for the ensuing year 
current policy limits unfavorable exposure of simulated net interest income to of the base case net interest income in either a rising or falling rate shock scenario immediate repricing of basis points 
the following is a summary of the rate shock results conducted under these various assumptions as december  annual simultaneous change rate in net interest shock income change bp million bp million bp million bp million management augments its simulation process with two other techniques  gap analysis and economic value of equity eve computations 
the most practical tool for day to day management of interest rate risk is gap analysis  which provides an array of various timeframes during which earning assets and funding sources can be expected to mature or reprice 
this information is ordinarily examined in the context of the results derived from the quarterly rate shock simulations 
management uses such information to identify specific cause and effect relationships that can be reviewed  analyzed  managed  or changed to ensure maximization of net revenue from intermediation activities 
the combination of gap analysis and rate shock simulations provides the most practical measurement tools for monitoring and managing of the largest source of revenue for community banks 
as with the simulation or shock analysis  community has established a policy limit for the cumulative twelve month gap of plus or minus of total assets 
at december   the twelve month gap fell well within this policy limit for each of the time intervals less than one year  as shown in the following summary cumulative gap interval expressed as of assets days days days eve computations provide a longer term assessment of interest rate risk  but are more practical for evaluating long term  strategic decision making 
eve has several limitations  including the intrinsic value of assets and liabilities does not necessarily represent the fair value of financial instruments since it does not include credit risk and liquidity  estimated cash flows are required for non maturity financial instruments and are  by their nature  inexact  and the future structure of community s balance sheet does not consider increased loan and deposit activities from core business within its present value assessment 
the results derived from eve computations  however  provide a valuable framework for managing longer term balance sheet exposures and interest rate volatility trends 
at the end of  all measures of eve fell within the policy limits established via the asset liability management policy  as approved by the board of directors 
contractual obligations significant contractual obligations at december  are summarized in the following table payments due by period less than more than dollars in thousands total year years years years long term debt      operating lease obligations      subordinated debt   time deposits     total      off balance sheet commitments as of december   community had unfunded commitments totaling million 
for details of these off balance sheet commitments  see notes to consolidated financial statements commitments and contingencies included in part ii  item regulatory matters community and its affiliates are subject to periodic examinations by the various regulatory agencies 
these examinations include  but are not limited to  procedures designed to review lending practices  risk management  credit quality  liquidity  compliance and capital adequacy 
during  the pennsylvania state department of banking  the federal deposit insurance corporation  and the federal reserve performed various examinations of community and its banking subsidiaries pursuant to their regular  periodic regulatory reviews 
no comments were received from these various bodies that would have a material adverse effect on community s liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
inflation community s ability to cope with the impact of inflation is best measured by its ability to respond to changing interest rates and manage non interest income and expense 
within its alco processes  community manages the mix of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in order to limit the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income 
inflation also has a direct impact on non interest income and expense such as service fee income  salary and benefits expenses  and other overhead expenses 
inflationary pressures over the last several years have been relatively modest but more recent trends suggest the potential for emerging inflationary pressure 
management will continue to monitor the potential for inflation and its impact on the pricing of products and services 
performance review versus community completed a year of record performance in  reporting the highest net income and earnings per share in its history up to that point 
at the same time  community made significant progress in its continuing effort to evolve into a community focused and integrated financial services corporation 
net income reached million  an increase from the net income of million reported in similarly  diluted earnings per share reached  a improvement from the reported in at the end of  community produced an roa of and an roe of  which were comparable to the performances of and in the prior year 
interest income interest income was million in  only slightly below the million recorded in  despite the fact that earning asset yields declined from to between the two years 
earning asset growth  fueled principally by loan growth  forged a increase from billion to billion and helped to offset the compression that would normally accompany lower earning asset yields 
from to  earning assets grew million  including million in loans and million in portfolio investment securities 
growth in loans accelerated during the year and was funded by both runoff in the investment portfolio and by an million increase in the level of deposits  most of which occurred in community s successful power checking offering 
interest expense interest expense on deposits declined dramatically during and was a major contributor to the nearly increase in net interest income 
despite increases in loan mix and an overall increase in the level of earning assets  community was not able to achieve improvement in interest income due to the impact of lower rates 
fortunately  that same rate environment permitted most banks to reduce interest rates on deposit funding and enabled community to reduce its overall funding costs from million in to million in  a decline of million or 
simultaneously  most banks continued to enjoy an influx of deposit funding as consumers opted for the security and short term liquidity of bank deposits 
total deposits grew by million 
for the first time in several years  community realized no growth in its time deposit categories as consumers were reluctant to extend maturities for relatively unattractive rate premiums 
community also made strategic use of other forms of funding in order to meet the consistent demand for credit extension that occurred in incremental borrowing rates on federal funds influenced the pricing of all short term sources of funds and made these borrowings far less expensive than other funding sources 
at various times during the year  community also increased its long term borrowings  which are composed principally of term funding available through the federal home loan bank programs 
community experienced a increase in long term funding  which included the first full year of million in trust preferred instruments issued under a pooled arrangement in december of community executed an additional million in these instruments at the end of  bringing its total issuances to million 
net interest income despite the decline in earning asset yields  interest income stabilized during most of the year as earning assets were redeployed from lower yielding  maturing investments to comparatively higher yielding loans 
the increasing affordability of credit created increased demand for both business and consumer credit products  resulting in an overall increase in earning assets 
at the same time  most banks continued to benefit from an influx of deposit funding 
the paucity of competitive returns in either the equity markets or other investment yields made bank deposits a viable short term alternative given consumer preferences for liquidity in anticipation of future rate increases 
most consumers were understandably averse to commit funds into longer maturity instruments given the expectation of higher rates 
the net impact was that interest expense declined by while interest income declined by only  resulting in an increase in net interest income of nearly  from million in to million in as a result of rate trends and other dynamics specific to community s balance sheet  community reported a decline in net interest spread from in to in  and a decline in net interest margin from to over the same period 
the decline in margin was also linked to the impact of reduced contribution from non interest funding sources  which declined from to 
during periods of declining interest rates  the contribution from non interest funds to net interest margin is reduced since funds are invested at progressively lower rates 
provision for credit losses for the second consecutive year  community reported a decline in the provision for loan losses  which reflected the steady improvement in the overall asset quality metrics of its loan portfolio 
the provision declined from million in to million in  while the relationship of the allowance for loan losses to loans declined from at december  to at the end of the provision  and the level of the allowance  was responsive to the changing credit quality conditions 
net charge offs during were only million  or of average loans  and reflected a significant decline from charge off levels of the past two years 
non accrual loans aggregated million  the lowest absolute level since the beginning of non interest income this increasingly vital component of the revenue stream grew substantially during as important steps were undertaken to solidify and expand community s integrated businesses and complementary banking services 
excluding the impact from sales of investment securities  non interest revenue grew  from million in to over million in the income recorded during  however  included two nonrecurring gains without which community would still have recorded an increase of  as adjusted for these items in both years 
amounts recorded in included a gain from the curtailment of a legacy  defined benefit plan in the third quarter and the recognition of a gain from the sale of an office  inclusive of both loans and deposits  in the fourth quarter 
community had recognized a similar gain from the sale of two offices and related deposits in non interest expenses total non interest expenses reached million in and reflected a increase  or million  from the million recorded in the growth was influenced by two major factors 
over of the increase of million  or million  was directly related to increased expenses from the integrated businesses acquired at different points during these increases included the expenses from abco  erie  and incremental insurance agency activity 
excluding the portion of the increase related to acquired businesses  operating expenses increased million or over expenses 
this second component of the increase was more directly related to the costs associated with expansion of the core banking franchise 
since the end of  community had added a total of seven new banking facilities while selling three offices in markets with less robust growth characteristics 
this selective expansion of the community banks franchise had a significant influence on the operating expense structure 
at the same time  this expansion had also been an important catalyst for the growth in loan and deposit balances since the end of excluding the impact of salaries added from the acquired businesses  salary and benefit expenses grew nearly million from to of this increase  over million was attributed to the effect of the average salary increase and to a heavier reliance on employee incentives 
payroll taxes and employee insurance costs were influenced by personnel added in both banking and acquired businesses  and by increases in health insurance rates 
the remainder of the increase  less than million  was affected by personnel added as a result of the new branch offices  the increased cost of the customer service center  and by the addition of new lenders for certain key growth markets 
expenses not related to employee related costs also grew 
occupancy expenses were influenced by increased costs associated with community office expansion and rose by just over million 
marketing and promotional expenses increased over thousand 
these costs were undertaken in order to increase community s market share in new markets and to preserve and expand share in its legacy communities 
marketing campaigns were undertaken to expand awareness  image and lead product advertising  especially in the first half of community also reflected a thousand increase in its communications and data connection expenses during the year

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a portion of the information related to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is included under management s discussion and analysis md a under the heading of asset liability management and liquidity 
the purpose of this presentation is to augment the discussion contained in md a 
market risk is defined as the exposure to economic loss that arises from changes in the values of certain financial instruments pursuant to factors arising out of the various categories of market risk 
market risk can include a number of categories  including interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  etc 
for domestic  community based banks  the vast majority of market risk is related to interest rate risk 
financial institutions use a number of techniques to attempt to measure the impact of interest rate risk which includes gap analysis  interest rate shock simulation and economic value of equity 
each of these techniques is used to help quantify market risk attributable to the inherent sensitivity of both interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity results when the maturity or repricing intervals of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments are different  creating a risk that changes in the level of market interest rates will result in disproportionate changes in the value of  and the net earnings generated from  community s interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments 
community s exposure to interest rate sensitivity is managed primarily through community s strategy of selecting the types and terms of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which generate favorable earnings  while limiting the potential negative effects of changes in market interest rates 
since community s primary source of interest bearing liabilities is customer deposits  its ability to manage the types and terms of such deposits may be somewhat limited by customer preferences in the market areas in which it operates 
borrowings  which include federal home loan bank fhlb advances and short term loans  subordinated notes  and other short term and long term borrowings  are generally structured with specific terms which in management s judgment  when aggregated with the terms for outstanding deposits and matched with interest earning assets  mitigate community s exposure to interest rate sensitivity 
the rates  terms and interest rate indices of community s interest earning assets result primarily from its strategy of investing in loans and securities a substantial portion of which have adjustable rate terms which permit community to limit its exposure to interest rate sensitivity  together with credit risk  while at the same time achieving a positive interest rate spread compared to the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the following table provides a measure of interest rate sensitivity for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december interest rate sensitivity at december  year dollars in thousands days days days or more total assets interest bearing deposits in other banks   loans held for sale   investment securities      loans a      earning assets      non earning assets   total assets      liabilities savings    time      time in denominations of  or more      short term borrowings   long term debt      subordinated debt    interest bearing liabilities      other liabilities and equity   total liabilities and equity      interest sensitivity gap periodic     cumulative   cumulative gap as a percentage of total assets a includes non accrual loans 
community seeks to maximize net interest income and minimize earnings volatility by managing the level of interest rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity is influenced by the repricing characteristic of both assets and liabilities and includes the volume of assets and liabilities repricing  the timing of repricing and the relative magnitude of the repricing 
while gap measurement provides an important tool to quantify the level of interest rate sensitivity at a specific point in time  its utility is constrained by the inherent limitations of gap measurement for a number of reasons 
first  changes in the level of interest rates cannot be expected to affect all assets and liabilities equally nor will they all be impacted at the same time 
second  assets and liabilities that are eligible to be repriced within a specific time frame may  in fact  not reprice or may not reprice to the same extent 
third  the measurement of gap is inherently limited in that it provides a representation of the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities at a specific point in time while actual sensitivity of assets and liabilities are undergoing constant change 
finally  much of the presentation of gap is  by necessity  based upon estimates and assumptions for certain assets and liabilities 
for example  savings  now accounts  and other forms of core deposits do not have defined maturities or repricing dates and therefore require estimates to be made based upon historical deposit decay rate analysis or other forms of approximation 
interest rate sensitivity  and the measurement thereof  are also influenced by the optionality of certain earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
for example  a substantial portion of community s loans and mortgage backed securities and residential mortgage loans contain significant embedded options  which permit the borrower to prepay the principal balance of the loan prior to maturity prepayments without penalty 
a loan s propensity for prepayment is dependent upon a number of factors  including the current interest rate and interest rate index if any of the loan  the financial ability of the borrower to refinance  the economic benefit to be obtained from refinancing  availability of refinancing at attractive terms  as well as economic and other factors in specific geographic areas which affect the sales and price levels of residential property 
in a changing interest rate environment  prepayments may increase or decrease on fixed and adjustable rate loans pursuant to the current relative levels and expectations of future short and long term interest rates 
investment securities  other than mortgage backed securities and those with early call provisions generally do not have significant embedded options and repay pursuant to specific terms until maturity 
while savings and checking deposits generally may be withdrawn upon the customer s request without prior notice  a continuing relationship with such customers is generally predictable resulting in a dependable and uninterrupted source of funds 
time deposits generally have early withdrawal penalties  while term fhlb borrowings and subordinated notes have prepayment penalties  which discourage customer withdrawal of time deposits and prepayment by community of fhlb borrowings and subordinated notes prior to maturity 
in addition to periodic gap reports comparing the sensitivity of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to changes in interest rates  management also utilizes a report which measures the exposure of community s economic value of equity to interest rate risk 
the model calculates the present value of assets  liabilities and equity at current interest rates  and at hypothetically higher and lower interest rates at one percent intervals 
the present value of each major category of financial instruments is calculated by the model using estimated cash flows based on prepayments  early withdrawals  weighted average contractual rates and terms  and discount rates for similar financial instruments 
the resulting present value of longer term fixed rate financial instruments is more sensitive to change in a higher or lower interest rate scenario  while adjustable rate financial instruments largely reflect only a change in present value representing the difference between the contractual and discounted rates until the next interest rate repricing date 
the information provided by these analyses provides some indication of the potential for interest rate adjustment  but does not necessarily mean that the rate adjustment will occur or that it will occur in accordance with the assumptions 
despite these inherent limitations  community believes that the tools used to manage its level of interest rate risk provide an appropriate measure of market risk exposure 
the following table reflects the estimated present value of assets  liabilities and equity using the model for community as of december  at current interest rates and hypothetically  higher and lower interest rates of one and two percent
