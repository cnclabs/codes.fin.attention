item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the audited consolidated financial statements of the company and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this document 
overview since divesting itself of its unprofitable multi level marketing and direct marketing units in see discontinued operations  the company s business plan has been to focus on its core brands 
the natrol and laci le beau brands are sold in health food stores  in mass market drug  food and retail chains as well as club stores 
prolab products are sold through distributors who in turn service retail accounts 
prolab s distributor network focuses on health food stores  health clubs and fitness facilities that cater to body builders and other individuals seeking a high level of fitness 
with the integration of prolab as a brand within natrol  natrol s health food oriented sales professionals have become responsible for presenting appropriate prolab products to health food retailers  who in turn  order from distributors who carry prolab product 
in addition  in more than of prolab sales are to distributors who sell prolab products outside the united states 
the company is continually seeking to expand the distribution of its best selling items to additional retail outlets and to create promotional opportunities for its products within its existing customer base 
the company also provides contract manufacturing services to other supplement companies and sells a limited number of raw material ingredients to other nutraceutical companies 
key issues for the company s management include product development  product introductions  inventory management  and controlling the cost of doing business in its various channels of trade 
the nutritional supplement business is dependent upon new product introductions for both growth and to replace volume lost by products reaching the end of their product life cycles 
as such  the company is continually researching potential new products for placement into the marketplace 
developing a single new product can be a multi year effort depending upon the complexity of the product and the amount of testing that must be completed to validate the product concept 
product introductions do not come without risk 
product launches can require substantial marketing support 
oftentimes retailers demand slotting fees or other up front expenditures 
if a product launch is not as successful as anticipated  additional promotional expenditures may be needed to sustain sales and reduce possible returns 
most vendors retain certain rights as they relate to product returns 
a broad product launch  one in which a new product is introduced into thousands of retail outlets  can cause a strain on corporate resources since inventories must be produced and delivered 
the resulting sales increase also leads to an increase in accounts receivable with customers 
nutritional supplements must maintain potency levels during their selling life 
as a result  products must be stamped with an expiration date and retailers will not accept product with limited shelf life into their warehouses 
shelf life issues require a high degree of supply chain management of raw materials and finished goods to ensure that shelf life is maximized and that the out of date inventory is minimized 
the competition for shelf space at retailers is intense 
natrol has ongoing discussions with its retail customers with regards to the allocation of shelf space and the level of promotional support for products 
retailers look to their vendors for promotional support for the products on their shelves in order to maximize sales 
vendors such as natrol look to retailers for advantageous placement of their products and promotion of their products within stores and within a retailer s promotional media such as newspaper advertisements placed by retailers 
the cost of promotions and support to the retailer on the part of vendors such as natrol can be very high and management must continually review its promotional efforts with retailers to ensure that sales are profitable 
future challenges include maintaining the current positive trends for the company across all product lines as well as developing new innovative products and delivery systems that will capture the support of consumers and sustain the growth experienced in as noted earlier the supplement business is characterized by trends in which some products fall out of favor presenting companies in the nutritional supplement business with the challenge of introducing new products which can replace business lost from products that are waning 
the company continues to believe that additional opportunities for growth exist as it seeks to improve its position with retailers and consumers 
management seeks to capitalize on these opportunities in what remains a very competitive marketplace 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires the company to make certain estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the company sells its products to retail outlets through a direct sales force and a national distributor network 
the company recognizes revenue from sales only after product is shipped and title is transferred 
net sales represent product shipped less actual and estimated future returns  spoilage allowances  allowances for product deemed to be unsaleable by customers  free goods shipped to customers for promotional or other purposes and slotting fees 
estimates and allowances are based upon known claims and an estimate of additional returns  however  the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
the company s recognition of revenue from sales to distributors and retailers is impacted by agreements giving them rights to return damaged and outdated products as well as the fact that as a practical business matter  the company and its customers are constantly working to ensure the profitability of its products within retailers by rotating slow moving items out of stores and replacing those products with what the company and the retailer expect will be more profitable  faster selling items 
the company s obligation to accept returns of slow moving items may or may not be contractually bound 
the company regularly monitors its historical patterns of returns from customers as well as current and ongoing sales to customers and  when information is available  consumer purchases of the company s products from the company s customers 
when historical trends with respect to customer returns are quantifiable  the company will create an allowance for future returns at the time sales are made 
should the company determine that a particular product is slow moving and will eventually result in significant returns  it will provide for those returns at the time such an assessment is made 
in recent years  as a result of a combination of the factors described above  gross sales have been materially offset by the estimated amount of returns and other charges to arrive at net sales 
it is also possible that returns could increase rapidly and significantly in the future 
accordingly  estimating product returns requires significant management judgment 
in addition  different return estimates that reasonably could have been used would have had a material impact on reported sales and thus have had a material impact on the presentation of results of operations 
for those reasons  the accounting estimate related to product returns is a critical accounting estimate 
the total amount charged against sales for returns and damages and outdates in   and respectively  was million million  and million 
impairment of goodwill 
on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill not be amortized 
in accordance with such adoption  the company identified all reporting units in conjunction with the provisions of sfas no 
and allocated all goodwill accordingly 
beginning in  goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
in  the company tested goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
the company performed the impairment test and determined that the there was potential impairment of the natrol segment 
the company performed the second step as of january  for the natrol segment and determined that its goodwill balance of  was impaired 
the impairment loss was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net of income tax benefit of approximately million  in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  the remaining goodwill balance at december  and was approximately million 
in the fourth quarter of  the company completed its annual goodwill impairment testing and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
additionally  during march  the company settled its litigation with the former owners of prolab nutrition  inc the company received million in cash  which was reflected in the financial statements for the quarter ending march  as a reduction of goodwill 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 the company performed its annual impairment test of goodwill during the fourth quarter of and concluded that it was not impaired 
income taxes 
deferred income tax assets have been established for future tax benefits related to deductible goodwill for which the company has recorded an impairment charge and for certain other temporary items  the aggregate benefit of which is approximately million 
realization of this benefit is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in future periods 
although it is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the carrying value of this benefit will be realized 
the amount of the benefit that is considered realizable  however  could change if estimates of future taxable income are adjusted in future periods 
inventory 
the company monitors its inventory and analyzes it on a regular basis 
cycle counts are taken to verify inventory levels 
in addition  the company analyzes the movement of items within its inventory in an effort to determine the likelihood that inventory will be sold or used before expiration dates are reached 
the company provides an allowance against that portion of its inventory that it believes is unlikely to be sold or used before expiration dates are reached 
at december   inventory allowances were approximately million 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
the company recognizes revenue from sales only after product is shipped and title is transferred 
net sales represent product shipped less actual and estimated future returns  spoilage allowances  allowances for product deemed to be unsaleable by customers  free goods shipped to customers for promotional or other purposes  rebates  slotting fees and other promotional expenditures 
estimates and allowances are based upon known claims and an estimate of additional returns when the amount of future returns from customers can be reasonably estimated 
net sales in increased  or million  to million from million in net sales is calculated by subtracting from gross revenue certain expenses such incentive rebates  shipping damages  and returns

during  the company improved the level of sales with club stores and mass market merchants and certain categories of products  weight loss products in particular  proved to be popular with consumers 
sales gains in these areas were partially offset by the loss of sales with other customers and declining sales of certain other product categories

net sales in increased  or million  to million from million in net sales in were positively affected by a lower level of returns than in the level of returns was approximately of gross shipments in and as compared to of gross shipments in during  the company worked to rationalize its product offerings in the mass market channel of trade where returns are most likely to occur 
during it became apparent to the company that sales of secondary and tertiary items in this channel of trade were not sufficient to prevent significant product returns 
this rationalization process directly resulted in lower net revenue since the company stopped selling many secondary and tertiary items within mass market accounts 
the company limited the sale of these items to specialty stores where the volume of sales was sufficient to prevent a large volume of returns 
as a result of this rationalization process  the level of returns was reduced substantially in both and the reduction in returns helped increase net revenue since returns reduce gross sales revenue when calculating net sales

during  the company reduced its debt by approximately  this use of cash was offset by approximately  raised through the exercise of employee stock option or the sale of stock to employees through the company s employee stock purchase program 
as of december   the company had million in outstanding debt versus at the end of the outstanding debt is related to a mortgage on the company s manufacturing headquarters facility and a mortgage on the company s shipping facility as well as the term note described under cash provided by financing activities 
the company s cash balance at the close of was approximately million excluding million in restricted cash as opposed to approximately million excluding million in restricted cash at the end of and million at the end of during  the company also entered into a line of credit with its bank 
the line of credit allows the company to borrow up to million 
the line of credit includes certain covenants that could limit its borrowings under the line of credit to less than million and if the company fails to meet certain financial covenants  borrowing under the line of credit may not be possible and any outstanding borrowing may have to be repaid upon demand 
the most restrictive covenants for the million revolving note are a tangible net worth plus subordinated debt of not less than million at all times  b a ratio of total senior liabilities to tangible net worth plus subordinated debt of not more than to at all times  and c a ratio of cash flow from operations to debt service of not less than to for each fiscal quarter on a rolling month basis 
should the company fail to meet the required financial covenants  there is no guarantee that  should the company need additional capital  that financial institutions will be willing to provide capital to the company 
also  in providing the company with additional funds  potential lenders may seek to institute covenants restricting the company from certain activities and if the company deems it necessary to borrow funds with these restrictions in place  it may find that its ability to compete effectively in its market sector is hindered 
in order to meet its long term liquidity needs  the company may be required to incur additional indebtedness or issue additional equity and debt securities  subject to market and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company or at all 
the failure to raise the funds necessary to finance its future cash requirements or consummate future acquisitions could adversely affect the company s ability to pursue new acquisitions and could negatively affect its operations in future periods 
the company believes that its cash balance together with cash generated from operations and the potential use of its line of credit should be sufficient to fund its anticipated working capital needs and planned capital expenditures for the next months 
however  if the company does not meet its operating plan it may also need additional borrowings to fund working capital needs
