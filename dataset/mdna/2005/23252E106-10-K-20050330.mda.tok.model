the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgements  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  realizability of inventory  reserves for warranty obligations  reserves for legal matters and product liability  recoverability of goodwill and valuation of deferred tax assets 
management bases its estimates and judgements on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results 
table of contents may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  which could materially impact the company s results of operations and financial position 
these critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the company s audit committee 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
management performs ongoing credit evaluations of customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
management continuously monitors collections and payments from customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
if the financial condition of a specific customer or the company s general customer base were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
realizability of inventory 
the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market 
management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and historical usage  after considering the impact of new products 
if actual market conditions and product demand are less favorable than projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
warranty reserve 
all products are warranted for up to three years for labor and up to ten years for structural frames 
warranty periods for parts range from one to three years depending on the part and the type of equipment 
a warranty liability is recorded at the time of product sale based on estimates that are developed from historical information and certain assumptions about future events 
future warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates  usage and service costs incurred in addressing warranty claims 
these factors are impacted by the level of new product introductions and the mix of equipment sold to the commercial and consumer markets 
if actual warranty costs differ from the estimates  adjustments to the warranty liability would be required 
legal matters 
the company has recorded a reserve related to certain legal matters for which it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the range of such loss can be determined 
with respect to other matters  management has concluded that a loss is only possible or remote and  therefore  no loss is recorded

the company maintains product liability insurance coverage subject to deductibles

if actual results vary from management s estimates  increases to the reserve would be required 
recoverability of goodwill 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  management is required to make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine whether the fair value of the business supports the carrying value of goodwill and net operating assets 
this analysis includes assumptions and estimates about future sales  costs  working capital  capital expenditures  and cost of capital 
if these assumptions and estimates change in the future  the company may be required to record an impairment charge related to goodwill 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
at december   there is a valuation allowance of  against the carrying value of the company s deferred income tax assets 
approximately  of future taxable income is needed prior to the expiration of the net operating losses to fully realize the company s deferred tax assets
