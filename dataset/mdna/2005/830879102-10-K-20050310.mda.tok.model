item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company  through its wholly owned subsidiary  skywest  operates one of the larger independent regional airlines in the united states 
skywest offers scheduled passenger and air freight service with approximately  daily departures to cities in states and three canadian provinces 
additionally  skywest provides customer handling services for approximately ten other airlines throughout skywest s system 
skywest has been a partner with delta in salt lake city and united in los angeles since and  respectively 
in  skywest expanded its relationship with united to provide service in portland  seattle tacoma  san francisco and additional los angeles markets 
in  skywest expanded its operations to serve as the delta connection in dallas fort worth 
however  effective january   skywest re deployed all its delta connection flights to salt lake city as a result of delta s decision to de hub its dallas fort worth operations 
in april  skywest signed an agreement with continental to supply continental with regional airline feed into continental s houston hub effective on july  in january  skywest and continental announced their mutual decision to end skywest s operations as a continental connection carrier not later than june  in  skywest expanded its united express operations to provide service in chicago 
today  skywest operates as a delta connection carrier in salt lake city and as a united express carrier in los angeles  san francisco  denver  chicago and the pacific northwest 
skywest believes its success in attracting multiple contractual relationships with major airline partners is attributable to its delivery of high quality customer service with an all cabin class fleet at a competitive cost structure 
as of december   approximately of skywest s capacity measured in asms was operated under the delta code  approximately was operated under the united code and approximately was operated under the continental code 
as of december   skywest operated a fleet of embs  united  delta and nine continental  crjs united  delta with four skywest spares  and crj s with united 
historically  multiple contractual relationships have enabled skywest to reduce reliance on any single major airline code and to enhance and stabilize operating results through a mix of skywest controlled or prorate flying and contract flying 
on contract routes  the major airline partner controls scheduling  ticketing  pricing and seat inventories and skywest is compensated by the major airline partner at contracted rates based on the completed block hours  flight departures and other operating measures 
on prorate flights  skywest controls scheduling  ticketing  pricing and seat inventories and receives a prorated portion of passenger fares 
as of march   essentially all of the company s embs flown for delta and continental were flown under prorate arrangements 
as of march   approximately of the company s embs flown in the united system were flown under contractual arrangements  with the remaining eight percent flown under prorate arrangements 
on september   the company announced the completion of a firm order for  seat crjs for its united express operations 
on february   the company amended the order to include ten additional crjs and two additional crjs  bringing the total order for the company s united express operations to crjs and ten crjs 
the company began taking delivery of these aircraft in january and has scheduled delivery of the remaining aircraft covered by the order through may the company s firm aircraft orders  as of december   consisted of orders for  crjs scheduled for delivery through may gross committed expenditures for these aircraft and related equipment  including estimated amounts for contractual price escalations are estimated to be approximately million through may  additionally  the company s agreement with bombardier  inc includes options for another aircraft that can be delivered in either or seat configurations 
the company presently anticipates that delivery dates for these aircraft could start in june and continue through september  however  actual delivery dates remain subject to final determination as agreed upon by the company and its major partners 
in december  united filed for reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
during september  the company entered into the united express agreement  which sets forth the principal terms and conditions governing the company s united express operations 
the united express agreement received all necessary approvals from the us bankruptcy court  creditors committee operating on behalf of united under bankruptcy protection and united s pilot union 
under the terms of the united express agreement  the company is compensated primarily on a fee per completed block hour and departure basis  plus a margin based on performance incentives  and reimbursed for fuel and other costs 
notwithstanding the execution of the united express agreement  united s bankruptcy filing could still lead to many other unforeseen expenses  risks and uncertainties 
although united has reported that it intends to emerge from its ongoing chapter bankruptcy on or before june   it could still file for liquidation under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code  or liquidate some or all of its assets through one or more transactions with third parties 
such events  individually or singly  could jeopardize the company s united express operations  leave the company unable to efficiently utilize the additional aircraft which the company is currently obligated to purchase  or result in other outcomes which could have a material adverse effect on the operations  activities or financial condition of the company 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  contained herein 
critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and require management s subjective and complex judgments due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company s critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  aircraft maintenance  aircraft leases and impairment of long lived assets as discussed below 
the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results will differ  and could differ materially from such estimates 
revenue recognition passenger and ground handling revenues are recognized when service is provided 
under the company s contract and prorate flying agreements with delta  united and continental  revenue is considered earned when the flight is completed 
during the six months ended june   the company and delta had not finalized the terms of the rate agreement  but had reached a conceptual understanding regarding rates  terms and conditions for contract flying under which the company operated as a delta connection carrier 
consequently  revenues under the delta arrangement for the six months ended june  were recorded based on the terms of the conceptual understanding 
during the quarter ended september   the company finalized the contract rates with delta for calendar no material adjustment resulted from the finalization of the rates for under the terms of the delta rate agreement for  the company is compensated primarily on a fee per completed block hour and departure basis plus a margin  and reimbursed for fuel and other certain costs 
the company and delta are continuing to negotiate rates for calendar that would provide for items such as multiple year automatic rate reset provisions  a contract extension and other provisions intended to enable more efficient contract administration for the parties 
in september  the company entered into the united express agreement  which had been previously approved on august  by the us bankruptcy court 
the united express agreement received all the necessary approvals from the creditors committee operating on behalf of united under bankruptcy protection and united s pilot union 
under the terms of the united express agreement  the company is compensated primarily on a fee per completed block hour and departure basis plus a margin based on performance incentives  and reimbursed for fuel and other certain costs 
on april   the company signed an agreement with continental to supply continental with regional airline feed into its houston hub beginning on july  the company announced on january  in conjunction with continental airlines to end its contractual relationship for flying turboprop aircraft as a continental connection carrier 
the company currently intends to phase out of its continental connection turbo prop flying from march to june the company s agreements with delta  united and continental contain certain provisions pursuant to which the parties could terminate the respective agreements  subject to certain rights of the other party  if certain performance criteria are not maintained 
the company s revenues could be impacted by a number of factors  including changes to the agreements  contract modifications resulting from contract re negotiations and the company s ability to earn incentive payments contemplated under applicable agreements 
in the event that the company s contractual rates have not been finalized at quarterly or annual financial statement dates  the company records revenues based on a prior period s approved rates  adjusted to reflect management s current estimate of the results of the current contract negotiations 
if the final contractual rates differ from those estimated by management  the company will reflect these changes in the consolidated financial statements in the period the contractual rates are finalized 
maintenance the company uses the deferral method of accounting for its emb engine overhauls  which provides for engine overhaul costs to be capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the engine 
for leased aircraft  the company is subject to lease return provisions that require a minimum portion of the life of an overhaul be remaining on the engine at the lease return date 
for emb engine overhauls related to leased aircraft to be returned  the company adjusts the estimated useful lives of the final engine overhauls based on the respective lease return dates 
due to the change in the company s contractual arrangement with one of its major partners and based on a letter agreement executed by and between the company and ge engine services  inc in april the letter agreement  the company elected to change from the accrual method of accounting to the direct expense method of accounting for crj engine overhaul costs effective january  the company believes the direct expense method is preferable in the circumstances because the maintenance liability is not recorded until the maintenance services are performed  the direct expense method eliminates significant estimates and judgments inherent under the accrual method  and it is the predominant method used in the airline industry 
accordingly  effective january   the company reversed its engine overhaul accrual that totaled million by recording a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million net of income taxes of million 
during the quarter ended december   the company completed negotiations and signed an engine services agreement with a third party vendor to provide long term engine services covering the scheduled and unscheduled repairs for engines on its crj regional jet aircraft effective january  aircraft leases the majority of the company s aircraft are leased from third parties 
in order to determine the proper classification of a lease as either an operating lease or a capital lease  the company must make certain estimates at the inception of the lease relating to the economic useful life and the fair value of an asset as well as select an appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting future lease payments 
these estimates are utilized by management in making computations as required by existing accounting standards that determine whether the lease is classified as an operating lease or a capital lease 
substantially all of the company s aircraft leases have been classified as operating leases  which results in rental payments being charged to expense over the terms of the related leases 
additionally  operating leases are not reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet and accordingly  neither a lease asset nor an obligation for future lease payments is reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
impairment of long lived assets as of december   the company had approximately million of property and equipment and related assets 
in accounting for these long lived assets  the company makes estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets  the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate 
factors indicating potential impairment include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the long lived assets  a significant change in the long lived assets condition  and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived asset 
in and  due to volatile economic conditions and indications of declining aircraft market values  the company evaluated whether the book value of the company s aircraft was impaired in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
no impairment was necessary based on the results of the evaluations 
there is inherent risk in estimating the future cash flows used in the impairment test 
if cash flows do not materialize as estimated  there is a risk the impairment charges recognized to date may be inaccurate  or further impairment charges may be necessary in the future 
results of operations compared to operating statistics 
the following table sets forth the major operational statistics of the company and the percentage of change for the years identified below 
year ended december  change passengers carried   revenue passenger miles   available seat miles   passenger load factor pts passenger breakeven load factor pts yield per revenue passenger mile revenue per available seat mile cost per available seat mile fuel cost per available seat mile average passenger trip length miles total asms generated by the company during the year ended december  increased from the year ended december  the increase in asms was primarily a result of the company increasing its operating aircraft to aircraft as of december   from aircraft as of december  during the year ended december   the company took delivery of new crjs  four used crjs with an average age of less than one year and new crjs 
net income 
net income increased to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  factors relating to the change in net income are discussed below 
passenger revenues 
passenger revenues include an amount designed to reimburse the company for aircraft ownership costs 
the amount deemed to be rental income for the year ended was million 
passenger revenues  which represented of consolidated operating revenues for the year ended december   increased to billion for the year ended december   from million  or of consolidated operating revenues  for the year ended december  passenger revenues  excluding fuel reimbursements from major partners  increased for the year ended december  the increase in passenger revenues excluding fuel was primarily due to a increase in asms  principally as a result of the company increasing its operating aircraft to aircraft as of december   from aircraft as of december   however  this increase was partially offset by the economic efficiencies of flying new  incremental regional jet aircraft 
these efficiencies are passed on to the company s major partners through the rates contemplated by their respective contracts 
twelve crjs and twelve additional crjs were placed into service under the company s united express operations during the year ended december  revenue per asm increased to  from for the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in fuel reimbursements from major partners 
passenger load factor 
passenger load factor increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the increase in load factor was due primarily to the further development of the company s relationships with united and delta whereby skywest supplements mainline service in previously established and developed markets 
additionally  the company is experiencing higher passenger acceptance of its regional jet aircraft 
total airline expenses excluding fuel 
total airline expenses for the year ended december   excluding fuel charges which are substantially reimbursable by the company s major partners  increased approximately from the same period of the increase was primarily a result of a increase in asms which resulted principally from the expansion of skywest s regional jet fleet from 
total operating expenses for the year ended december  increased at a lower rate than asm growth  primarily due to the increased operating efficiencies obtained from the new crjs that were added to the fleet during the year and from increased stage lengths flown by the new crjs 
operating and interest expenses 
operating and interest expenses increased to billion for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in total operating and interest expenses was due principally to the growth in skywest s regional jet fleet from as a percentage of consolidated operating revenues  total operating and interest expenses increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the increase in operating and interest expenses as a percentage of consolidated operating revenues was primarily due to significant increases in fuel costs year over year 
operating revenues increased for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   while total operating and interest expenses increased over the same period 
the increase in total operating revenues was primarily due to the growth in skywest s regional jet fleet from airline operating and interest expenses  excluding fuel charges  per asm decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the primary reason for the decrease was the increased capacity of the company s regional jet aircraft and the increase in stage lengths flown by the company s regional jet aircraft 
the following tables set forth information regarding the company s operating expense components for the years ended december  and operating expenses are expressed as a percentage of operating revenues 
individual expense components are also expressed as cents per asm 
year ended december  amount percentage of revenue cents per asm amount percentage of revenue cents per asm in thousands in thousands salaries  wages and employee benefits   aircraft costs   maintenance   fuel   other airline expenses   interest   total airline expenses   the cost per asm of salaries  wages and employee benefits remained constant at for the year ended december  and december  the average number of full time equivalent employees increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase in number of employees was due  in large part  to the addition of personnel required for the new regional jet flying and ground handling operations within the company s united express operations 
the cost per asm for aircraft costs  including aircraft rent and depreciation  decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the decrease in cost per asm was primarily due to the addition of twelve crjs  which have a lower operating cost per asm than the company s existing aircraft 
additionally  the decrease was due  in part  to the company changing the estimate on depreciable lives of rotable spares from five years to ten years effective january this change in estimate increased the company s pretax income by  for the year ended december  the impact of this change on costs per asm for the year ended december  was and the remaining decrease was primarily due to the increase in the number of regional jets that were added to skywest s fleet during the cost per asm for maintenance expense increased to for the year ended december   from the year ended december  the increase in cost per asm was primarily due to the timing of certain maintenance events 
under the company s united express agreement  specific amounts are included in the rates and charges for mature maintenance on regional jet engines that the company records as revenue 
however  consistent with the change to a direct expense maintenance policy the company records maintenance expense on its crj engines as it is incurred 
as a result  during the year ended december  the company collected and recorded as revenue million pretax under the united express agreement  with no corresponding offset for crj engine maintenance overhauls since none were incurred 
because the maintenance line in the table set forth above does not include salaries  wages and employee benefits associated with the company s maintenance operations those costs are stated separately in the table  the maintenance expense line in the above table differs from the maintenance line in the company s condensed consolidated statements of income set forth in item below 
the cost per asm for fuel increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the average price of fuel increasing to per gallon during the year ended december   from per gallon for the year ended december  the cost per asm for other expenses  primarily consisting of landing fees  station rentals  computer reservation system fees and hull and liability insurance  decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily related to the company s elimination of certain reservation and distribution costs which were previously associated with the united express agreement that are now handled directly by united  along with the increase in stage lengths flown by the company s regional jets 
interest expense increased to approximately million during the year ended december   from approximately million during the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was primarily due to the long debt financing of the new regional jets acquired by the company 
the emergency war time supplemental appropriations act of became effective on may   and the company received approximately million under the act 
this legislation provides for compensation to domestic airlines based on their proportional share of passenger security and infrastructure security fees paid  as well as reimbursement for installing fortified flight deck doors 
this legislation also provides for the suspension of passenger and infrastructure fees from june  through october  and an extension of war risk liability and hull insurance coverage through december  pursuant to the consolidated appropriations act of  congress further extended the government s mandate to provide war risk insurance through august  the company is unable to predict whether the government will extend this insurance coverage past august  however  under terms of the company s contracts with its major partners  such insurance expense is a pass through cost and is not anticipated to have a material impact on the company s ongoing operations or future financial results

twenty eight additional crjs were placed into service under the company s united express operations and additional crjs were placed in service under the delta connection operations during the year ended december  revenue per asm decreased to from for the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in asms produced by crjs and crjs resulting in lower revenue per asm pursuant to the terms of the company s agreements with delta and united 
passenger load factor

interest expense increased to approximately million during the year ended december   from approximately million during the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was primarily due to the temporary long debt financing of the regional jets acquired by the company during the twelve month period ended december  liquidity and capital resources the company had working capital of million and a current ratio of at december   compared to working capital of million and a current ratio of at december  the principal sources of funds during the year ended december  were million provided by operating activities  million of proceeds from returns on aircraft deposits  million of proceeds from the issuance of long term debt and million from the sale of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options under the company s stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
during the year ended december   the company invested million in flight equipment  million in marketable securities  million in buildings and ground equipment and million in other assets 
the company made principal payments on long term debt of million  repurchased common stock for approximately million and paid million in cash dividends 
these factors resulted in a million increase in cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december  the company s receivables increased by approximately million from december  from december  the increase was primarily due to the increase in the price of fuel during the year and the fuel reimbursement provisions of the company s contracts with its major partners 
under the contracts  the company receives weekly wire transfers based on estimated production and fuel costs  which payments are subsequently reconciled and adjusted after quarter and year end 
the company s position in marketable securities  consisting primarily of bonds  bond funds and commercial paper  increased to million at december   compared to million at december  the increase in marketable securities was due primarily to the company s cash management policies as excess cash is invested in marketable securities 
at december   the company s total capital mix was equity and debt  compared to equity and debt at december  the change in the total capital mix during was primarily due to the company s refinancing crjs debt into long term operating lease agreements with third party lessors during the year ended december  the company expended approximately million for aircraft related capital expenditures during the year ended december  these expenditures consisted primarily of million for rotable spares  million for engine overhauls  million for aircraft improvements  and million for buildings  ground equipment and other assets 
the company had available million in an unsecured bank line of credit through january   with interest payable at the bank s base rate less one quarter percent  which was a net rate of at december  the company had  of letters of credit with no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit as of december  additionally  the company had  of letters of credit outstanding with another bank as of december  the company believes that in the absence of unusual circumstances  the working capital available to the company will be sufficient to meet its present financial requirements  including expansion  capital expenditures  lease payments and debt service obligations for at least the next months 
at december  and december   the company classified million of cash as restricted cash on its condensed consolidated balance sheets as required by the company s workers compensation policy 
significant commitments and obligations the following table summarizes skywest s commitments and obligations stated in calendar years except as noted for each of the next five years and thereafter in thousands total thereafter firm aircraft commitments   operating lease payments for aircraft and facility obligations  principal maturities on long term debt    total commitments and obligations    on september   the company announced the completion of a firm order for  seat crjs for its united express operations 
on february   the company amended the order to include crjs and two additional crjs  bringing the total order for the company s united express operations to crjs and additional crjs 
the company began taking delivery of these aircraft in january and has scheduled delivery of the remaining aircraft covered by the order through may the company s firm aircraft orders  as of december   consisted of orders for  seat crjs scheduled for delivery through may gross committed expenditures for these aircraft and related equipment  including estimated amounts for contractual price escalations are estimated to be approximately million through may  the company has also obtained options to acquire another crjs that can be delivered in either or seat configurations 
the company presently anticipates that delivery dates for these aircraft could start in june and continue through september  however  actual delivery dates remain subject to final determination as agreed upon by the company and its major partners 
the company has not historically funded a substantial portion of its aircraft acquisitions with working capital 
rather  the company has generally funded its aircraft acquisitions through a combination of operating leases and debt financing 
at the time of each aircraft acquisition  the company has evaluated the financing alternatives available  and selected one or more of these methods to fund the acquisition 
subsequent to this initial acquisition of an aircraft  the company may also refinance the aircraft or convert one form of financing to another eg  replacing debt financing with leveraged lease financing 
at present  the company s management intends to satisfy its firm aircraft purchase commitment  as well as its acquisition of any additional aircraft  through a combination of operating leases and debt financing  consistent with its historical practices 
based on current market conditions and discussions with prospective leasing organizations and financial institutions  the company s management currently believes the company will be able to obtain financing for the committed acquisitions  as well as additional aircraft  without materially reducing the amount of working capital available for its operating activities 
the company has significant long term lease obligations primarily relating to its aircraft fleet 
these leases are classified as operating leases and therefore are not reflected as liabilities on the company s condensed consolidated balance sheets 
at december   the company had aircraft under lease with remaining terms ranging from one to years 
future minimum lease payments due under all long term operating leases were approximately billion at december  assuming a discount rate  which is the rate used to approximate the implicit rates within the applicable aircraft leases  the present value of these lease obligations would have been equal to approximately billion at december  as part of the company s leveraged lease agreements  the company typically agrees to indemnify the equity owner participant against liabilities that may arise due to changes in benefits from tax ownership of the respective leased aircraft 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this report 
the company s total long term debt at december  was million  of which million related to the acquisition of emb and crj aircraft and million related to the company s corporate office building 
during the year ended december   the company acquired two new crjs from proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of million 
the average effective rate on the debt related to the emb and crj aircraft was approximately at december  seasonality as is common in the airline industry  the company s pro rate operations are favorably affected by increased travel  historically occurring in the summer months  and are unfavorably affected by decreased business travel during the months from november through january and by inclement weather which occasionally results in cancelled flights  principally during the winter months 
new accounting standard as contemplated by sfas statement  accounting for stock based compensation  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using intrinsic value method set forth in opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of the fair value method set forth in statement r is likely to have a significant impact on the company s results of operations  although it is not anticipated to have a significant impact on the company s overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had the company adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to the company s consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this report 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future primarily because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were   and  in   and  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk aircraft fuel in the past  the company has not experienced difficulties with fuel availability and currently expects to be able to obtain fuel at prevailing prices in quantities sufficient to meet its future needs 
pursuant to the company s contract flying arrangements  united will bear the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations on the company s united express flights 
on the company s delta connection regional jet flights  delta will bear the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations 
on the majority of the company s delta connection routes flown by embs  as well as all existing continental connection routes  the company will bear the economic risk of fuel fluctuations 
at present  the company believes that its results from operations will not be materially and adversely affected by fuel price volatility 
interest rates the company s earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the amounts of variable rate long term debt and the amount of cash and securities held 
the interest rates applicable to variable rate notes may rise and increase the amount of interest expense 
the company would also receive higher amounts of interest income on cash and securities held at the time  however  the market value of the company s available for sale securities would likely decline 
at december   the company had variable rate notes representing of its total long term debt compared to of its long term debt at december  for illustrative purposes only  the company has estimated the impact of market risk using a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point for both variable rate long term debt and cash and securities 
based on this hypothetical assumption  the company would have incurred an additional  in interest expense and received  in additional interest income for the year ended december  and the company would have incurred an additional  in interest expense and received  in additional interest income for the year ended december  the company has an interest rate swap agreement designed to manage its interest rate exposure on the debt instrument related to the company s headquarters 
the company s policies do not permit management to enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging purposes 
accordingly  the company does not speculate using derivative instruments 
the company assesses interest rate cash flow risk by identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities 
the fair values of the company s derivative instruments are recognized as other current liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet 
the company adopted sfas no
