table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands the following discussion and analysis is intended to provide a narrative of our financial results and an evaluation of our financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
overview we are principally engaged in the production of grade i ammonium perchlorate ap for aerospace and defense industries 
in addition  we produce and sell sodium azide  the primary component of a gas generator used in certain automotive airbag safety systems  and halotron  a chemical used in fire extinguishing systems ranging from portable fire extinguishers to airport firefighting vehicles 
we also hold a ownership stake in energetic systems  an entity we consolidate under fin r that manufactures and distributes commercial explosives 
these businesses collectively represent our specialty chemicals operating segment 
on october   we acquired aerojet general corporation s in space propulsion business isp which manufactures products for the satellite market 
we report isp as our aerospace equipment segment and have included its financial performance in our consolidated financial statements since the first quarter of fiscal our other businesses segment includes the production of water treatment equipment  including equipment for odor control and disinfection of water and the sale of our improved land in the gibson business park near las vegas  nevada 
all of the real estate assets that were targeted for sale have been completed and we do not anticipate significant real estate sales activity in the future financial reporting periods 
the following table reflects the revenue contribution percentage from our major product lines for the years ended september specialty chemicals perchlorates packaged explosives sodium azide halotron total specialty chemicals aerospace equipment other businesses real estate water treatment equipment total other businesses total revenues 
table of contents specialty chemicals segment perchlorate chemicals perchlorate chemicals account for a major portion of the specialty chemicals segment revenues 
in general  demand for grade i ap is driven by a relatively small number of department of defense dod and national aeronautics and space administration nasa contractors 
grade i ap customer contracts we entered into an agreement with the thiokol propulsion division of alcoa thiokol with respect to the supply of ap through the year the agreement  as amended  provides that during its term thiokol will make all of its ap purchases from us 
in addition to the grade i ap purchased from us  thiokol may use ap inventoried by it in prior years 
the agreement also establishes a pricing matrix under which grade i ap unit prices vary inversely with the quantity of grade i ap sold by us to all of our customers 
grade i ap unit prices in the matrix at all quantity levels escalated each year through fiscal in fiscal  prices were subject to a one time downward adjustment of approximately 
such downward adjustment had the effect of reducing revenues and operating cash flows on grade i ap sold to thiokol by in fiscal after the adjustment  ap unit prices established in the pricing matrix continue to escalate each year through fiscal we also entered into an agreement with alliant techsystems  inc alliant to extend an existing agreement through the year the agreement establishes prices for any grade i ap purchased by alliant from us during the term of the agreement as extended 
under this agreement  alliant agrees to use its efforts to cause our grade i ap to be qualified on all new and current programs served by alliant s bacchus works 
during  alliant acquired thiokol 
we have agreed with alliant that the individual agreements in place prior to alliant s acquisition of thiokol remain in place 
all thiokol programs existing at the time of the alliant acquisition principally the space shuttle and minuteman will continue to be priced under the thiokol agreement 
all alliant programs principally the delta  pegasus and titan will be priced under the alliant agreement 
grade i ap sales volume beginning in the s  demand for perchlorate chemicals has been declining 
the suspension of space shuttle missions after the columbia disaster in february  further reduced sales volume of our grade i ap products 
this reduced sales volume exceeded the actual consumption of grade i ap product by our customers 
as a result  our customers inventory levels of grade i ap have continued to increased 
in august  the space shuttle completed a successful flight  but continued to experience certain technical issues 
space shuttle flights are expected to resume beginning in the spring of  although there is no assurance in this regard 
our revenues  operating income and cash flows from operating activities are negatively impacted by these lower sales volume levels 
in addition  demand for grade i ap is program specific and dependent upon  among other things  governmental appropriations 
we have no ability to influence the demand for grade i ap 
any decision to further delay  reduce or cancel space shuttle flights over an extended period of time would have a further significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
during the next several years  the demand for grade i ap will be primarily driven by the following factors the timing of the space shuttle s return to flight 
the number of shuttle flights between now and the retirement of the shuttle fleet 

table of contents the amount of inventory of grade i ap owned by our customers 
the amount of nasa s and the dod s annual budget over the next several years 
the us has proposed a long term human and robotic program to explore the solar system  starting with a return to the moon 
this program will require the development of new space exploration vehicles that is likely to stimulate the demand for grade i ap 
as a consequence of the new space initiatives discussed above  as well as other factors  including the completion and utilization of the international space station iss  the long term demand for grade i ap will be driven by the following factors the timing of the retirement of the space shuttle fleet 
the timing of the development of the new crew launch vehicle clv and the number of clv launches 
the timing of the development and testing of the new heavy launch vehicle hlv used to transport material and supplies to the iss and the moon  and the number of hlv launches 
other perchlorate products we also produce and sell a number of other grades of ap and different types and grades of sodium and potassium perchlorates collectively other perchlorates 
other perchlorates have a wide range of prices per pound  depending upon the type and grade of the product 
other perchlorates are used in a variety of applications  including munitions  explosives  propellants  and initiators 
some of these applications are in a development phase  and there can be no assurance of the success of these initiatives 
packaged explosives as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we began consolidating our es packaged explosive joint venture as of march  geographic markets for es products include the us  canada and mexico 
overall consumption of commercial explosives is expected to increase through  as a result of continued growth in the coal and mining sectors  as well as the continued strong performance of the aggregates and construction sectors 
a significant event for the packaged explosives business was the transportation highway bill which passed in fall the funds are expected to stimulate spending on new road construction and infrastructure maintenance  and some activity has already begun 
the spring season is when the majority of projects will be initiated 
the bill should increase demand for packaged products used in road construction and quarrying  particularly our presplit product line and the new emulsion products 
the increased mining activity in the coal industry seen during is expected to continue as long as there is no significant downturn in the price of oil and natural gas  with coal being broadly recognized as a leading future commodity in the energy sector 
we expect sales of products sold to the eastern us coal industry to remain robust in while the high energy prices have benefited the coal industry  high natural gas prices have created numerous cost issues for suppliers in the explosives industry 
however  there can be no assurance that the transportation bill will stimulate spending or that mining activity in the coal industry will continue 

table of contents sodium azide worldwide demand for sodium azide has declined considerably over the last several years 
currently  worldwide demand for sodium azide is substantially less than worldwide supply 
based principally upon market information received from airbag inflator manufacturers  we expect sodium azide use to continue to decline and that inflators using sodium azide will be phased out over a period of approximately five years 
halotron fire extinguishing agents halotron is a series of clean fire extinguishing agents designed to replace halon based fire extinguishing systems 
demand for halotron depends upon a number of factors including the willingness of commercial  government  and military consumers to spend more on a clean agent than for conventional  cheaper agents 
the effects of competing products  as well as existing and potential governmental regulations also affects demand for halotron products 
aerospace equipment segment the isp business is the sole contributor to the aerospace equipment segment 
the isp business manufactures in space propulsion thrusters that are either monopropellant or bipropellant based products 
monopropellant thrusters utilize a single liquid fuel source typically hydrazine  whereas bipropellant thrusters use a combination of a liquid fuel typically monomethylhydrazine and an oxidizer 
the selection of a propulsion system is based on the satellite s or spacecraft s mission and encompasses a variety of factors  including i type of mission  ii length of mission  iii type of orbit  iv weight of vehicle  v type of launch vehicle  and vi price 
the isp business supplies both government and commercial satellite customers 
sales to these customers are usually awarded based on product performance  pricing  and reliability 
the market for isp products is expected to grow modestly over the next several years 
government funding for defense  earth observation and space systems satellites is stable  but continued budget pressure will stretch the timing of some of these programs 
funding for missile defense programs is also expected to remain flat given budget pressures 
the commercial satellite industry is expecting higher growth as a result of demand from broadband  hdtv and communications applications 
higher growth rates are expected in the markets for isp products after the next several years as a result of the replacement of existing military and defense communications constellation systems 
other businesses segment the other businesses segment includes sales from our real estate and water treatment equipment businesses 
water treatment equipment pepcon systems designs  manufactures and services equipment used to purify air or water in municipal  industrial and power generation applications 
the systems are based on an electrochemical process to produce disinfection chemicals and are marketed under the chlormaster and odormaster names 
disinfection chemicals are used by i municipalities and sewage plants for the disinfection of drinking water  effluent and waste water  ii power plants  desalination plants  chemical plants and on shore off shore crude oil facilities for the control of marine growth in seawater used in cooling water circuits  and iii by composting plants for the deodorizing of malodorous compounds in contaminated air 

table of contents the heart of the process is a proprietary electrochemical cell which uses brine or seawater to produce the disinfection chemicals 
we compete with companies that utilize other technologies and those that utilize technologies similar to ours 
our success depends principally upon our ability to be cost competitive and  at the same time  to provide a quality product and service 
a significant portion of our water treatment equipment sales are to overseas customers  specifically in the middle and far east 
real estate our real estate operations have been in a wind down phase over the last several years 
in fiscal we completed the sale of all our nevada real estate assets that were targeted for sale 
raw materials and manufacturing costs the principal elements comprising our cost of sales are raw materials including inbound freight  component parts  electric power  labor  purchasing  receiving  inspection  warehousing  manufacturing overhead  delivery costs  depreciation and amortization and the book basis in real estate sold 
the major raw materials used in our production processes are graphite  sodium chlorate  ammonia  hydrochloric acid  sodium metal  nitrous oxide and hcfc significant increases in the cost of raw materials may have an adverse impact on margins if we are unable to pass along such increases to our customers 
all the raw materials used in our manufacturing processes have been available in commercial quantities 
although we recently had some difficulty in obtaining graphite  significant progress has been made in establishing an assured source of supply 
we continue to explore other technologies that would reduce our dependence on graphite 
a substantial portion of the total cash costs of operating our specialty chemical plants  consisting mostly of labor and overhead  are largely fixed in nature 
profitability although our operating results have not been subject to seasonal fluctuations  they have been and are expected to continue to be subject to variations from quarter to quarter and year to year due to the following factors  among others as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we may incur material legal and other costs associated with environmental remediation  litigation and other contingencies  the magnitude  pricing and timing of perchlorate chemicals  sodium azide  halotron  packaged explosives and water treatment equipment sales in the future is uncertain  the results of periodic reviews for impairments of long lived assets  and the ability to pass on increases in raw material costs to our customers 

table of contents results of operations revenues year ended september  percentage change vs 
vs 
specialty chemicals aerospace equipment other businesses total revenues specialty chemicals segment revenues increased  during fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year 
this increase is primarily due to fiscal year including a full twelve months of revenues from es packaged explosives in fiscal year  while fiscal year only included es revenues for the period april  to september  as noted above  we began consolidating es results effective march  fiscal year revenues from perchlorates were consistent with the prior year 
specialty chemicals segment revenues decreased  during fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year principally from a sales volume decrease in perchlorate chemicals and a decrease in the sales volume of sodium azide in fiscal as compared to fiscal other businesses segment revenues increased  during fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year principally due to an increase in real estate sales of  we do not expect significant revenues from real estate sales in the future because we have sold substantially all real estate assets we targeted for sale 
there were no significant real estate sales in fiscal water treatment equipment sales for fiscal year were consistent with the prior year 
other businesses segment revenue decreased during fiscal compared to the prior year due to a  decline in real estate sales and a decline of  due to a decrease in the volume of water treatment equipment sales 
cost of revenues year ended september  percentage change vs 
vs 
revenues cost of revenues gross margin gross margin percentage cost of revenues increased  or  during fiscal year primarily due to the related increase in revenues 
the percentage increase in cost of sales was at a lower rate than the percentage increase in revenues  and as a result  gross margin percentage improved during fiscal year the consolidated gross margin for fiscal year reflects offsetting factors 
fiscal year includes our aerospace equipment segment products  which carry lower gross margin percentages than our specialty chemicals products 
this downward effect on consolidated gross margin percentage was offset by high margins on fiscal year real estate sales 
cost of revenues increased  during fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year  while revenues during the same period declined 
the increases in cost of revenues were primarily due to fixed costs that were allocated over a smaller base of perchlorates and other specialty chemical sales volumes for the year 
in addition  higher costs were incurred due to the inclusion of the es packaged explosives joint venture beginning in the third quarter of fiscal this increase in costs was partially offset by lower sales volumes in our other businesses segment  which resulted in a significant decline during fiscal year in the gross margin percentage 

table of contents operating expenses year ended september  percentage change vs 
vs 
operating expenses percentage of revenues operating selling  general and administrative expenses increased  during fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to i the consolidation of our es joint venture beginning march   ii the addition of the isp business into the newly formed aerospace equipment segment on october   and iii an increase in corporate development costs 
the increase in operating expenses during fiscal was partially offset because the second quarter of fiscal included a charge for severance expense of  which did not recur in fiscal operating expenses increased  during fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in operating expenses was due primarily to i severance costs of  see note to the consolidated financial statements  ii the addition of the es joint venture during the third quarter of fiscal  iii an increase in environmental remediation expenditures  and iv corporate development costs 
environmental charge during our fiscal third quarter  we recorded a charge of  for our estimate of the probable costs of our remediation efforts at the henderson site  including the costs for equipment  operating and maintenance costs  and consultants 
key factors in determining the total estimated cost include an estimated project life of years and estimates for capital expenditures and annual operating and maintenance costs 
this estimate is based on information currently available to us and may be subject to material adjustment upward or downward in future periods as new facts or circumstances may indicate

total segment operating loss for fiscal year increased  compared to the prior year 
the decrease in operating results is comprised of i an increase in gross margin of  ii an increase in operating expenses of  and iii environmental remediation change of  each of these factors is discussed in more detail above 
specialty chemicals segment operating loss for fiscal year includes a charge for environmental remediation of  other businesses operating loss for fiscal year includes the above mentioned severance charge 

table of contents interest and other income interest expense year ended september  percentage change vs 
vs 
interest and other income interest expense loss on debt extinguishments we earn interest income on our cash and cash equivalents balances 
interest income varies with these balances 
other income in fiscal year includes related to cash distribution from our interest in a partnership that indirectly owns an interest in an office building see note to our consolidated financial statements 
interest expense and the loss on debt extinguishments in fiscal year relate primarily to warrants that expired in fiscal year and the redemption of related notes see note to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes our income tax provision benefit rate differs from the federal statutory rate due to state income taxes  amounts that were expensed for book purposes that are not deductible for income tax purposes  changes in our valuation allowances  other adjustments to our estimates of tax liabilities 
a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to our effective tax benefit rate is as follows for the years ended september federal income tax at the statutory rate state income tax  net of federal benefit nondeductible expenses valuation allowance change in deferred tax liability estimate other effective tax rate the change in deferred tax liability estimate for the year ended september   represents an amount previously recorded for tax contingency reserves 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we concluded that these tax contingency reserves were no longer required and were reversed 
based on the analysis of deferred income taxes  we revised our estimate for deferred tax liability by approximately  as of september  and  we recorded valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets of and  respectively 
we have federal net capital loss carryforwards available to offset future capital gains of  for which we had previously provided a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset related of during the year ended september   we concluded that our capital loss carryforwards could be utilized  and accordingly  we reversed the valuation allowance for this item 
in addition  we have operating loss carryforwards of  for certain us states and for the uk we do not anticipate future taxable income in these states or the uk  and accordingly provided a valuation allowance of during the year ended september  
table of contents extraordinary gain in october  we acquired isp 
the fair value of the current assets acquired and current liabilities assumed exceeded the purchase price 
accordingly  non current assets were recorded at zero  and an extraordinary gain of  net of approximately income tax expense was recorded based on the excess fair value of net assets over the purchase price 
cumulative effect of accounting change as discussed in note to our condensed consolidated financial statements  we consolidated our es joint venture as of march  we reported a cumulative effect of an accounting change of net of tax benefit of in our second quarter statement of operations to reflect the loss that we would have incurred had the es joint venture been consolidated since its inception 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires that we adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires significant judgments  often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
however  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results 
sales and revenue recognition revenues for specialty chemicals and water treatment equipment sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment has been made  title passes  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
some of our perchlorate product customers have requested that we store materials purchased from us in our cedar city facility bill and hold transactions 
we recognize the revenue and profit from these bill and hold transactions at the point at which title and risk of ownership transfers from us 
we receive cash for the full amount of real estate sales at the time of closing which is when the sale is recorded 
revenues from our aerospace equipment segment are derived from contracts that are accounted for in conformity with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa audit and accounting guide  audits of federal government contracts and the aicpa s statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contacts 
we account for these contracts using the percentage of completion method and measure progress on a cost to cost basis 
the percentage of completion method recognizes revenue as work on a contract progresses 
revenues are calculated based on the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion of the contract 
for fixed price and fixed price incentive contracts  if at any time expected costs exceed the value of the contract  the loss is recognized immediately 
a significant change in estimated costs on one or more contract could have a material effect on our results of operations in any given period 

table of contents depreciable or amortizable lives of long lived assets our depreciable or amortizable long lived assets include property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  which are recorded at cost 
depreciation or amortization is recorded using the straight line method over the asset s estimated economic useful life 
economic useful life is the duration of time that we expect the asset to be productively employed by us  which may be less than its physical life 
our assumptions on the following factors  among others  affect the determination of estimated economic useful life wear and tear  obsolescence  technical standards  contract life  and changes in market demand for products 
the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness  especially in light of changed business circumstances 
for example  changes in technological advances  changes in the estimated future demand for products  or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated 
in these cases  we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life  thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 
likewise  if the estimated useful life is increased  the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 
impairment of long lived assets we test our property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
examples of such circumstances include  but are limited to  operating or cash flow losses from the use of such assets or changes in our intended uses of such assets 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if we determine that an asset is not recoverable  then we would record an impairment charge if the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value 
fair value is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group 
the assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent management s best estimates at the time of the impairment review 
factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions  sales volume and prices  costs to produce and inflation 
changes in key assumptions or actual conditions which differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge 
we use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews but cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges 
environmental costs we are subject to environmental regulations that relate to our past and current operations 
we record liabilities for environmental remediation costs when our assessments indicate that remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
when the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of the liability  that estimate is used 
when the information is only sufficient to estimate a range of probable liability  and no amount within the range is more likely than the other  the low end of the range is used 
estimates of liabilities are based on currently available facts  existing technologies and presently enacted laws and regulations 
these estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new circumstances 
accrued environmental remediation costs include the undiscounted cost of equipment  operating and maintenance costs  and fees to outside law firms or consultants  for the estimated duration of the remediation activity 
estimating environmental costs requires us to exercise substantial judgment regarding the cost  effectiveness and duration of our remediation activities 
actual future expenditures could differ materially to our current estimates 
we evaluate potential claims for recoveries from other parties separately from our estimated liabilities 
we record an asset for expected recoveries when recovery of the amounts are probable 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
this method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credits 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we evaluate the likelihood of realizing its deferred tax assets by estimating sources of future taxable income and the impact of tax planning strategies 
the effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the current period tax provision 
actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates depending upon changes in income tax laws  actual results of operations  and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities 
tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed 
pension benefits we sponsor defined benefit pension plans in various forms for employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several assumptions and statistical variables are used in actuarial models to calculate the pension expense and liability related to the various plans 
we determine the assumptions about the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets and the future rate of compensation increases based on consultation with investment advisors and historical plan data 
the actuarial models also use assumptions on demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover 
depending on the assumptions selected  pension expense could vary significantly and could have a material effect on reported earnings 
the assumptions used can also materially affect the measurement of benefit obligations 
information with respect to pension expenses and liabilities  together with the impact of changes in key assumptions is discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas  inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter 
the statement clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the statement is effective for us beginning in fiscal we are in the process of assessing the extent of the impact such adoption would have on our financial statements  if any 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  share based payment which requires all entities to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments granted to employees and directors 
this statement is effective for us beginning with our first quarter of fiscal we are in the process of assessing the impact the adoption of this statement will have on our consolidated financial statements

debt related payments in fiscal year relates to the redemption of all of our outstanding senior unsecured notes in march capital resources our primary source of working capital is cash flow from our operations 
the use and availability of our cash is affected by the timing  pricing and magnitude of orders for our products  and the timing of cash outflows relating to our environmental matters or other contingencies 
we believe that our cash flows from operations and existing cash balances will be adequate for the foreseeable future to satisfy the needs of our operations 
as a result of the litigation and contingencies discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we have incurred legal and other costs  and we may incur material legal and other costs associated with the resolution of litigation and contingencies in future periods
