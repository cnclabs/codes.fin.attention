business trends and conditions title insurance segment 
title insurance revenue is closely related to the level of real estate activity and the average price of real estate sales 
real estate sales are directly affected by the availability of funds to finance purchases  predominantly mortgage interest rates 
other factors affecting real estate activity include  but are not limited to  demand for housing  employment levels  family income levels and general economic conditions 
in addition to real estate sales  mortgage refinancing is an important source of title insurance revenue 
we have found that residential real estate activity generally decreases in the following situations when mortgage interest rates are high or increasing  when the mortgage funding supply is limited  and when the united states economy is weak 
because commercial real estate transactions tend to be driven more by supply and demand for commercial space and occupancy rates in a particular area rather than by macroeconomic events  our commercial real estate title insurance business can generate revenues which offset the industry cycles discussed above 
because these factors can change dramatically  revenue levels in the title insurance industry can also change dramatically 
for example  beginning in the second half of and through  steady interest rate increases caused by actions taken by the federal reserve board resulted in a significant decline in refinancing transactions 
as a result  the market shifted from a refinance driven market in to a more traditional market driven by new home purchases and resales in and however  beginning in january and continuing through june of  the federal reserve board reduced interest rates by basis points  bringing interest rates down to their lowest level in recent history  which again significantly increased the volume of refinance activity 
beginning in mid june and continuing through december  the ten year treasury bond yield steadily increased from a low of nearly to more than  causing mortgage interest rates to rise  which decreased the volume of refinance activity 
although mortgage interest rates again dropped during february and march of  causing open orders to increase substantially towards the end of the first quarter of  rates have fluctuated only slightly since then  and have not decreased to a level that triggered significant refinance volume in such as that experienced in historically  real estate transactions have produced seasonal revenue levels for title insurers 
the first calendar quarter is typically the weakest quarter in terms of revenue due to the generally low volume of home sales during january and february 
the fourth calendar quarter is typically the strongest in terms of revenue due to commercial customers desiring to complete transactions by year end 
significant changes in interest rates may alter these traditional seasonal patterns due to the effect the cost of financing has on the volume of real estate transactions 
financial institution software and services segment 
in our financial institution processing business  increases in deposit and lending transactions can positively affect our business and thus the condition of the overall economy can have an effect on our growth 
while this segment generally is not significantly affected by the cyclicality of real estate transactions  our ability to expand our mortgage loan processing business is correlated to the total number of mortgage loans outstanding 
in our financial institution software and services segment  we compete for both licensing and outsourcing business  and thus we are affected by the decisions of financial institutions to outsource the services we provide 
table of contents instead of simply licensing our applications 
as a provider of outsourcing solutions  we benefit from the greater revenues that result from a financial institution s decision to outsource its processing to us 
generally  financial institutions of all sizes will consider outsourcing information technology and business process services to varying degrees  although smaller financial institutions are more likely to outsource all information technology functions to companies such as ours since they generally do not have the staff  budget or competencies to implement and operate highly complex technical environments 
larger financial institutions have historically chosen to limit outsourcing to specific application functions or services in connection with a particular product or operation such as mortgage processing 
generally  demand for outsourcing solutions has increased over time as providers such as ourselves realize economies of scale and improve our ability to provide services that improve customer efficiencies and reduce costs 
we may be affected by the industry consolidation trend in the banking industry 
this trend may be beneficial or detrimental to our financial institution software and services businesses 
when consolidations occur  merger partners often operate disparate systems licensed from competing service providers 
the newly formed entity generally makes a determination to migrate its core systems to a single platform 
when a financial institution processing client is involved in a consolidation  we may benefit by expanding the use of our services if they are chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity 
conversely  we may lose market share if a customer of ours is involved in a consolidation and our services are not chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity 
lender outsourcing solutions segment 
the level of residential real estate activity  which depends in part on the level of interest rates  affects the level of revenues from our lender outsourcing solutions segment 
revenues from loan facilitation services increase as the amount of mortgage originations  from both home purchases and mortgage refinancings  increases 
during the second half of  mortgage interest rates began to decline  causing an increase in refinance activity 
this trend continued through the first six months of the increasing refinance activity  coupled with record levels of residential resale and new home sales  resulted in an exceptionally strong business climate for our loan facilitation services in according to the mortgage bankers association  us mortgage originations including refinancings were approximately trillion  trillion and trillion in  and  respectively 
while prevailing mortgage interest rates have declined to record lows in recent years and the volume of real estate transactions has experienced record highs  we do not expect these trends to continue 
although originations in surpassed the record levels set in  interest rates began to rise during the fourth quarter of mortgage originations declined in to an estimated trillion as the interest rate environment slowed the pace of refinancings 
most economists expect a relatively stable to marginally increasing mortgage interest rate environment in and the current mortgage bankers association forecast is for trillion of mortgage originations in relatively higher interest rates are also likely to result in seasonal effects having more influence on real estate activity 
traditionally  the greatest volume of real estate activity  particularly residential resale transactions  has occurred in the spring and summer months 
in contrast  we believe that a higher interest rate environment may increase the volume of consumer defaults and thus favorably affect our default management services business  which provides services relating to residential mortgage loans in default 
the overall strength of the economy also affects default revenues 
information services segment 
the level of residential real estate activity  such as the number of residential resales  new home sales and mortgage originations  also affects revenues derived from many of the services we provide in our information services segment 
we experienced increased residential loan refinancing activity coupled with record levels of residential resale and new home sales during through while refinancing activity declined  residential sales remained strong in we expect that current interest rate levels and any future increase in interest rates will most likely result in levels of mortgage originations in that are lower than critical accounting policies the accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
certain of these policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that 
table of contents affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures with respect to contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
see note a of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
valuation of investments 
we regularly review our investment portfolio for factors that may indicate that a decline in fair value of an investment is other than temporary 
some factors considered in evaluating whether or not a decline in fair value is other than temporary include i our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in value  ii the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  and iii the financial condition and prospects of the issuer 
such reviews are inherently uncertain and the value of the investment may not fully recover or may decline in future periods resulting in a realized loss 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we have significant intangible assets that were acquired through business acquisitions 
these assets consist of purchased customer relationships  contracts  and the excess of purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired goodwill 
the determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of the purchase price to the fair values of the intangible assets requires significant judgment and may affect the amount of future amortization on intangible assets other than goodwill 
we have made acquisitions in the past that have resulted in a significant amount of goodwill 
as of december  and december   goodwill was  million and  million  respectively 
the majority of our goodwill as of december  relates to goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisitions of aurum in march  sanchez in april  kordoba in september  intercept in november  the acquisition of the minority interest of fnis in september  the acquisitions of fi in april and anfi in march  and the chicago title merger in the process of determining whether or not an asset  such as goodwill  is impaired or recoverable relies on projections of future cash flows  operating results and market conditions 
such projections are inherently uncertain and  accordingly  actual future cash flows may differ materially from projected cash flows 
in evaluating the recoverability of goodwill  we perform an annual goodwill impairment test on our reporting units based on an analysis of the discounted future cash flows generated by the reporting units underlying assets 
we have completed our annual goodwill impairment test on our reporting units and have determined that each of our reporting units has a fair value in excess of its carrying value 
such analyses are particularly sensitive to changes in estimates of future cash flows and discount rates 
changes to these estimates might result in material changes in the fair value of the reporting units and determination of the recoverability of goodwill which may result in charges against earnings and a reduction in the carrying value of our goodwill 
in connection with our acquisitions  we have also recognized identifiable intangible assets purchased  which typically consist of software  purchased customer relationships and contracts 
the valuation of these assets involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as customer retention  future cash flows and discount rates 
if any of these assumptions change  it could affect the carrying value of these assets 
purchased customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives using an accelerated method which takes into consideration expected customer attrition rates over a ten year period 
contractual relationships are generally amortized using the straight line method over their contractual life 
long lived assets 
we review long lived assets  primarily computer software  property and equipment and other intangibles  such as customer relationships and contracts  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if indicators of impairment are present  we estimate the future net cash flows expected to be generated from the use of those assets and their eventual disposal 
we would recognize an impairment loss if the aggregate future net cash flows were less than the carrying amount 
as a result  the carrying values of these assets could be significantly affected by the accuracy of our estimates of future net cash flows  which cannot be selected with certainty 
in and  we determined that the carrying value of certain of our intangible assets may not be recoverable and recorded impairment charges of million and million  respectively relating to the 
table of contents write off of these assets  respectively 
these impairments were recorded as other operating expenses in our and consolidated statements of earnings 
reserve for claim losses 
our reserve for claim losses includes reserves for known claims as well as for losses that have been incurred but have not yet been reported to us  net of expected recoupments 
each known claim is reserved based on our review of the estimated amount of the claim and the costs required to settle the claim 
reserves for claims that are incurred but not reported are estimates that are established at the time premium revenue is recognized based on historical loss experience and other factors  including industry trends  claim loss history  current legal environment  geographic considerations and type of policy written 
loss reserve estimates are reviewed periodically and adjusted by management as experience develops or new information becomes known  and changes in prior estimates affect our reported results 
our claim loss provision for our title insurance segment as a percentage of total title premiums was in  in and in the title loss provision in our financial statements reflects a higher estimated loss for the policy year offset in part by a favorable adjustment in reserves for business in previous policy years 
consistent with  the favorable adjustment was attributable to lower than expected payment levels on previous issue years that included periods of increased resale activity as well as a high proportion of refinance business 
as a result  title policies issued in previous years have been replaced by the more recently issued policies  therefore generally terminating much of the loss exposure on the previously issued policies 
the unfavorable development during reflects the higher than expected payment levels on previously issued policies 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations and note j of notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of our reserves for claim losses at december   and our independent actuaries perform projections of required reserves periodically during the year and at year end 
we compare these projections to the recorded reserves to evaluate their adequacy 
our reserves for claim losses are within the range projected by our independent actuaries 
our loss reserves for our specialty insurance business also require significant estimates 
revenue recognition 
the following describes our revenue recognition policies as they pertain to each of our segments title insurance segment 
our direct title insurance premiums and escrow and other title related fees are recognized as revenue at the time of closing of the related transaction as the earnings process is then considered complete 
our agency title insurance premiums are recognized as revenue when policies are reported to us and are recorded as revenue on a gross basis before the deduction of agent commissions 
in addition  we accrue for unreported agency title insurance premiums based on historical reporting patterns of our agents and current trends 
specialty insurance segment

in this segment  we recognize revenues relating to bank processing services and mortgage processing services along with software licensing and software related services 
several of our contracts include a software license and one or more of the following services data processing  development  implementation  conversion  training  programming  maintenance and application management 
in some cases  these services are offered in combination with one another and in other cases we offer them individually 
revenues from bank and mortgage processing services are typically volume based depending on factors such as the estimated number of accounts  transactions processed and computer resources utilized 
the substantial majority of the revenues in this segment are from outsourced data processing and application management arrangements 
revenues from these arrangements are recognized as services are performed in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 revenue recognition and related interpretations 
sab no 
sets forth guidance as to when revenue is realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
table of contents exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue and deferred costs related to implementation  conversion and programming services associated with our data processing and application management agreements are deferred during the implementation phase and subsequently recognized using the straight line method over the term of the related agreement 
at each reporting period  we evaluate these deferred costs for impairment 
in the event that our arrangements with our customers include more than one product or service  we determine whether the individual elements can be recognized separately in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf addresses the determination of whether an arrangement involving more than one deliverable contains more than one unit of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting 
if all of the products and services are software related products and services as determined under american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop no 
 entitled software revenue recognition  and sop  entitled modification of sop no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  we apply these pronouncements and related interpretations to determine the appropriate units of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units 
we recognize software license and maintenance fees as well as associated development  implementation  training  conversion and programming fees in accordance with sop no 
and sop no 
initial license fees are recognized when a contract exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  software delivery has occurred and collection of the receivable is deemed probable  provided that vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  has been established for each element or for the undelivered elements 
we determine the fair value of each element or the undelivered elements in multi element software arrangements based on vsoe 
if the arrangement is subject to accounting under sop no 
 vsoe for each element is based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
if evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
if evidence of fair value does not exist for one or more undelivered elements of a contract  then all revenue is deferred until all elements are delivered or fair value is determined for all remaining undelivered elements 
revenue from maintenance and support is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
we record deferred revenue for maintenance amounts invoiced prior to revenue recognition 
with respect to a small percentage of revenues  we use contract accounting  as required by sop no 
 when the arrangement with the customer includes significant customization  modification  or production of software 
for elements accounted for under contract accounting  revenue is recognized in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  using the percentage of completion method since reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and contract hours applicable to various elements of a contract can be made 
revenues in excess of billings on these agreements are recorded as unbilled receivables and is included in accounts receivable 
billings in excess of revenue recognized on these agreements are recorded as deferred revenue until revenue recognition criteria are met 
changes in estimates for revenues  costs and profits are recognized in the period in which they are determinable 
when our estimate indicates that the entire contract will be performed at a loss  a provision for the entire loss is recorded in that accounting period

although the mix of direct and agency title premiums changed from to  total title premiums and escrow and other title related fees remained fairly consistent in as compared with the increase in total revenue in is due in part to increases in real estate and refinance activity as a result of decreasing interest rates 
further  the acquisitions of financial institution software and services companies  real estate related information service companies and specialty insurance companies and the integration of these operations into our core businesses in  as well as increased realized gains on investments  also contributed to increased revenue in compared to 
table of contents title insurance premiums  including those that are part of the lender outsourcing solutions segment  were  million in   million in and  million in direct title premiums decreased from to while agency title premiums increased during the same period 
the decrease in direct title premiums is primarily due to a reduction in refinancing activity experienced in as compared with and was partially offset by an increase in the average fee per file 
the increase in direct title premiums in was due primarily to increases in resale and refinance activity as a result of the decline in interest rates through mid year the increase in resale and refinance activity in was partially offset by a decrease in the average fee per file 
the increase in the fee per file in and the decrease in fee per file in is consistent with the overall level of refinance activity experienced during and the fee per file tends to increase as mortgage interest rates rise  and the mix of business changes from a predominately refinance driven market to more of a resale driven market

liquidity and capital resources cash requirements 
our cash requirements include debt service  operating expenses  taxes  capital expenditures  systems development  treasury stock repurchases  business acquisitions and dividends on our common stock 
we believe that all anticipated cash requirements for current operations will be met from internally generated funds  through cash dividends from subsidiaries  cash generated by investment securities and borrowings through public debt offerings and existing credit facilities 
our short term and long term liquidity requirements are monitored regularly to match cash inflows with cash requirements 
we forecast the daily needs of all of our subsidiaries and periodically review their short term and long term projected sources 
table of contents and uses of funds  as well as the asset  liability  investment and cash flow assumptions underlying these projections 
we have million of capacity under a shelf registration statement that may be used  subject to market conditions  to issue debt or other securities at our discretion 
we presently intend to use the proceeds from the sale of any securities under the shelf registration statement primarily to finance strategic opportunities 
while we seek to give ourselves flexibility with respect to meeting such needs  there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit us to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time  or at all 
our two significant sources of internally generated funds are dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries 
as a holding company  we receive cash from our subsidiaries in the form of dividends and as reimbursement for operating and other administrative expenses we incur 
the reimbursements are executed within the guidelines of management agreements among us and our subsidiaries 
our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by state regulation in their ability to pay dividends and make distributions 
each state of domicile regulates the extent to which our title underwriters can pay dividends or make other distributions to us 
as of december    million of our net assets were restricted from dividend payments without prior approval from the departments of insurance 
during  our first tier title subsidiaries can pay or make distributions to us of approximately million without prior approval 
our underwritten title companies  financial institution software and services companies  lender outsourcing businesses and information services companies collect revenue and pay operating expenses 
however  they are not regulated to the same extent as our insurance subsidiaries 
positive cash flow from these subsidiaries is invested primarily in cash and cash equivalents 
financing 
on march   we announced that we had completed a previously announced recapitalization plan of fis see recent developments in item 
this recapitalization was accomplished through fis entering into billion in senior credit facilities consisting of a million term loan a facility  a billion term loan b facility collectively  the term loan facilities and a million revolving credit facility revolver with a consortium of lenders led by bank of america 
fis fully drew upon the entire billion in term loan facilities to consummate the recapitalization 
revolving credit borrowings and term a loans bear interest at a floating rate  which will be  at the borrowers option  either the british bankers association libor or base rate plus  in both cases  an applicable margin  which is subject to adjustment based on the senior secured leverage ratio of the borrowers 
the term b loans bear interest at either the british bankers association libor plus per annum or  at the borrowers option  a base rate plus per annum 
the borrowers may choose one month  two month  three month  six month  and to the extent available  nine month or one year libor  which then applies for a period of that duration 
interest is due at the end of each interest period provided 
for libor loans that exceed three months  the interest is due three months after the beginning of such interest period 
the term loan a matures in march   the term loan b in march   and the revolver in march  the term loan facilities are subject to quarterly amortization of principal in equal installments of 
of the original principal amount with the remaining balance payable at maturity 
in addition to the scheduled amortization  and with certain exceptions  the term loan facilities are subject to mandatory prepayment from excess cash flow  issuance of additional equity and debt and sales of certain assets 
voluntary prepayments of both the term loan facilities and revolving loans and commitment reductions of the revolving credit facility are permitted at any time without fee upon proper notice and subject to minimum dollar requirements 
the new credit facilities contain affirmative  negative  and financial covenants customary for financings of this type  including  among other things  limits on the creation of liens  limits on the incurrence of indebtedness  restrictions on investments and dispositions  limitations on dividends and other restricted payments and capital expenditures  a minimum interest coverage ratio  and a maximum secured leverage ratio 
on november   we  through a subsidiary  entered into a new credit agreement providing for a million  year revolving credit facility due november  the facility provided an option to increase the size of the credit facility an additional million 
this credit agreement bore interest at a variable rate based on leverage and was unsecured 
the interest rate under the new credit agreement during 
table of contents the time it was outstanding was libor plus 
in addition  we were required to pay a commitment fee on the entire facility 
on november  we drew down approximately million to fund the acquisition of intercept 
on march   we repaid this facility with a portion of the net proceeds from our sale of a minority interest in fis to a group of investors and terminated the agreement 
on november  we entered into a new credit agreement providing for a million  year revolving credit facility due november  the credit agreement bears interest at a variable rate based on the debt ratings assigned to us by certain independent agencies  and is unsecured 
the current interest rate under this credit agreement is libor plus 
in addition  we pay a facility fee on the entire facility 
as of december   million was outstanding under our credit agreement and we had million in borrowings available to us 
during  net borrowings were million under our credit facility  primarily to finance our acquisitions of aurum  covansys and kordoba 
on march   we used a portion of the proceeds received from the fis note to pay this line down completely although we did not terminate this facility 
our credit agreement imposes certain affirmative and negative covenants on us relating to current debt ratings  certain financial ratios related to liquidity  net worth  capitalization  investments  acquisitions and restricted payments  and certain dividend restrictions 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants 
on march   we issued million aggregate principal amount of notes 
we received proceeds of approximately million  after expenses  which was used to pay a portion of the  million purchase price for fi 
interest is payable semiannually and the notes are due in march the table below shows the pro forma impact on our capitalization of the recapitalization  minority interest sale  related debt agreements and the per share special dividend as if the events announced on march  had occurred on december  see note r year ended december  historical pro forma cash and cash equivalents   a total long term debt   b minority interest   c stockholders equity common stock  par value additional paid in capital retained earnings other equity total   d total capitalization the pro forma adjustments in the above table include the following a an increase in cash and cash equivalents of million relating to an inflow of  million from the term loan facilities and million from the sale of a minority interest in fis  less transaction costs of million  repayments of million in outstanding credit facilities as of december  and an assumed dividend payout of  million based on outstanding shares at december  b an increase in notes payable of  million relating to the  million from the term loan facilities less the repayment of million in credit facilities that were outstanding as of december  c an increase in minority interest of million relating to the sale of of fis 
d a decrease in equity of  million relating to the payment of the  million dividend offset by a gain of million on the sale of the minority interest in fis 

table of contents following the recapitalization  fis is highly leveraged 
as of march   it is paying interest at a rate of one month libor plus  or 
at that rate  the annual interest on its  million of debt would be million 
a one percent increase in the libor rate would increase its annual debt service on the term loan facilities by million 
the credit rating assigned to the term loan facilities and revolver by standard poor s is currently bb 
we believe that fis and its subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to pay all interest due on the term loan facilities over at least the next twelve months 
over the long term  fis may have to seek other sources of funds to repay the principal balances of the term loan facilities 
because the performance of fis is subject to risks and uncertainties  including those described in business risk factors  there can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available for such purposes when needed 
seasonality 
historically  real estate transactions have produced seasonal revenue levels for title insurers 
the first calendar quarter is typically the weakest quarter in terms of revenue due to the generally low volume of home sales during january and february 
the fourth calendar quarter is typically the strongest in terms of revenue due to commercial entities desiring to complete transactions by year end 
significant changes in interest rates may alter these traditional seasonal patterns due to the effect the cost of financing has on the volume of real estate transactions 
contractual obligations 
our financing obligations generally include our credit agreement and other debt facilities and operating lease payments on certain of our premises and equipment 
as of december   our required annual payments relating to these contractual obligations are as follows thereafter total dollars in thousands notes payable operating lease payments purchase commitments total our title claims loss reserve projected annual payments as of december  were as follows thereafter total title claim loss reserve percentage of total as of december  we had title insurance reserves of million 
the amounts and timing of these obligations are estimated and are not set contractually 
nonetheless  based on historical title insurance claim experience  we anticipate the above payment patterns 
while we believe that historical loss payments are a reasonable source for projecting future claim payments  there is significant inherent uncertainty in this payment pattern estimate because of the potential impact of changes in future mortgage interest rates  which will affect the number of real estate and refinancing transactions and  therefore  the rate at which title insurance claims will emerge  the legal environment whereby court decisions and reinterpretations of title insurance policy language to broaden coverage could increase total obligations and influence claim payout patterns  events such as fraud  defalcation  and multiple property title defects can substantially and unexpectedly cause increases in both the amount and timing of estimated title insurance loss payments  loss cost trends whereby increases decreases in inflationary factors including the value of real estate will influence the ultimate amount of title insurance loss payments  and claims staffing levels whereby claims may be settled at a different rate based on the future staffing levels of the claims department 

table of contents in addition to the amounts shown in the table  at december   we held claim reserves of million in respect of our specialty insurance reserves 
because of uncertainty with respect to the precise payout pattern of these reserves  and their small size  we have not allocated them to the periods shown  although we would expect the substantial majority of these amounts to be paid by in addition  the above tables do not reflect amounts under fis s new credit facilities  which were entered into after december  or the recent payments under our other credit facilities as described above 
capital stock transactions 
on april   our board of directors approved a three year stock repurchase program 
purchases are made by us from time to time in the open market  in block purchases or in privately negotiated transactions 
from january   through december   we repurchased a total of  shares of common stock for million  or an average price of 
additionally  on december   we entered into an agreement to repurchase  shares of company common stock from willis stein partners willis stein and jp morgan chase  as escrow agent for the former stockholder of aurum 
we acquired aurum in march the purchase price per share of was a discount to the closing price of the company s common stock on december  on march   we issued  shares of our common stock in connection with the acquisition of anfi  inc on april   we issued  shares of our common stock to alltel in connection with our acquisition of fi 
on september   we issued  shares of our common stock in connection with the acquisition of fnis 
on february   we issued  shares of our common stock in connection with the acquisition of an additional interest in hansen 
on march   we issued  shares of our common stock in connection with the acquisition of aurum 
on april   we issued  shares of our common stock in connection with the acquisition of sanchez 
see note b of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements 
on january   our board of directors declared a stock dividend to stockholders of record as of february   payable on february  on april   our board of directors declared a five for four stock split payable may  to stockholders of record as of may  all data with respect to earnings per share  dividends per share and share information  including price per share where applicable  in the consolidated financial statements and notes and elsewhere in this form k have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split and stock dividend 
additional minimum pension liability adjustment 
discount rates that are used in determining our december  projected benefit obligation and net periodic pension costs were based on prevailing interest rates as of december  similar to prior years  we considered the moody s aa corporate bond index at that date as an appropriate basis in determining the discount rate 
a decrease in the discount rate used at december  resulted in an additional minimum pension liability adjustment 
as such  we recorded a net of tax charge of million to accumulated other comprehensive loss in in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
equity investments 
our equity investments are in public companies whose security prices are subject to significant volatility 
should the fair value of these investments fall below our cost bases and or the financial condition or prospects of these companies deteriorate  we may determine in a future period that this decline in fair value is other than temporary  requiring that an impairment loss be recognized in the period such a determination is made 
off balance sheet arrangements 
other than facility and equipment leasing arrangements  we do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities 
on june  we entered into an off balance sheet financing arrangement commonly referred to as a synthetic lease 
the owner lessor in this arrangement acquired land and various real property improvements associated with new construction of an office building in jacksonville  florida that will be part of our corporate campus and headquarters 
the lease expires on september   with renewal subject to consent of the lessor and the lenders 
the lessor is a third party limited liability company 
the synthetic lease facility provides for amounts up to million 
as of december   approximately million had been drawn on the facility to finance land costs and related fees and expenses 
the leases include guarantees by us for a substantial portion of the financing  and options to purchase the facilities at the outstanding lease balance  the maximum guarantee is of the 
table of contents outstanding lease balance 
the guarantee becomes effective if we decline to purchase the facilities at the end of the lease and also decline to renew the lease 
the lessor financed the acquisition of the facilities through funding provided by third party financial institutions 
we have no affiliation or relationship with the lessor or any of its employees  directors or affiliates  and our transactions with the lessor are limited to the operating lease agreements and the associated rent expense that will be included in other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings after the end of the construction period 
we do not believe the lessor is a variable interest entity  as defined in fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
in addition  we have verified that even if the lessor was determined to be a variable interest entity  we would not have to consolidate the lessor nor the assets and liabilities associated with the assets leased to us 
this is because the assets leased by us will not exceed of the total fair value of the lessor s assets excluding any assets that should be excluded from such calculation under fin  nor did the lessor finance or more of the leased balance with non recourse debt  target equity or similar funding see note k 
in conducting our operations  we routinely hold customers assets in escrow  pending completion of real estate transactions 
certain of these amounts are maintained in segregated bank accounts and have not been included in the consolidated balance sheets 
as a result of holding these customers assets in escrow  we have ongoing programs for realizing economic benefits during the year through favorable borrowing and vendor arrangements with various banks 
there were no investments or loans outstanding as of december  related to these arrangements see note k 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
r sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires that compensation cost relating to share based payments be recognized in the company s financial statements 
the company is preparing to implement this standard effective july  during  the company adopted the fair value recognition provision of statement of financial accounting standards no

 for stock based employee compensation  effective as of the beginning of the company had elected to use the prospective method of transition  as permitted by statement of financial accounting standards no

under this method  stock based employee compensation cost is recognized from the beginning of as if the fair value method of accounting had been used to account for all employee awards granted  modified  or settled in years beginning after december  sfas no 
r does not allow for the prospective method  but requires the recording of expense relating to the vesting of all unvested options beginning in the third quarter of since we adopted sfas no 
in  the impact of recording additional expense in under sfas no 
r relating to options granted prior to january  will not be significant 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our consolidated balance sheet includes a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks 
see business investment policies and investment portfolio and note c of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following sections address the significant market risks associated with our financial activities for the year ended december  interest rate risk our fixed maturity investments and borrowings are subject to interest rate risk 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments 
additionally  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 

table of contents equity price risk the carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet date 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and  consequently  the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee  the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions 
furthermore  amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold 
caution should be used in evaluating our overall market risk from the information below  since actual results could differ materially because the information was developed using estimates and assumptions as described below  and because our reserve for claim losses representing of total liabilities is not included in the hypothetical effects 
the hypothetical effects of changes in market rates or prices on the fair values of financial instruments would have been as follows as of or for the year ended december  a 
an approximate million net increase decrease in the fair value of fixed maturity securities would have occurred if interest rates were basis points lower higher as of december  the change in fair values was determined by estimating the present value of future cash flows using various models  primarily duration modeling 
b 
an approximate million net increase decrease in the fair value of equity securities would have occurred if there was a price increase decrease in market prices 
c 
it is not anticipated that there would be a significant change in the fair value of other long term investments or short term investments if there was a change in market conditions  based on the nature and duration of the financial instruments involved 
d 
interest expense on average variable rate debt outstanding would have increased decreased approximately million  if interest rates increased decreased basis points for assuming that our new credit facilities were outstanding  interest expense on the  million facility would increase decrease approximately million  if interest rates increased decreased basis points
