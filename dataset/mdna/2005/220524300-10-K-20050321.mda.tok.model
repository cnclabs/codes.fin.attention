item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes related thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
critical accounting policies and management estimates the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and most demanding of their judgment 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this process forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
sab provides guidance in applying accounting principles generally accepted in the united states to revenue recognition issues  and specifically addresses revenue recognition for up front  nonrefundable fees received in connection with research collaboration arrangements 
in accordance with sab  revenues from up front fees from our collaborators are deferred and recorded over the term that we provide ongoing services 
similarly  research support payments are recorded as revenue as we perform the research under the related agreements 
we record grant revenues as we incur expenses related to the grant projects 
all amounts received under collaborative research agreements or research grants are nonrefundable  regardless of the success of the underlying research 
revenues from milestone payments are recognized when earned  as evidenced by written acknowledgment from our collaborator  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievement was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  and ii our performance obligations after the milestone achievement will continue to be funded by our collaborator at a comparable level to that before the milestone achievement 
if both of these criteria are not met  the milestone payment is recognized over the remaining minimum period of our performance obligations under the agreement 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf of the financial accounting standards board reached consensus on issue eitf issue addresses the accounting for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
specifically  issue requires the recognition of revenue from milestone payments over the remaining minimum period of performance obligations 
as required  we will apply the principles of issue to multiple element agreements that we may enter into after july  employee stock options and stock based compensation as permitted under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  we have elected to follow accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  in accounting for our employee stock options  given that the alternative fair 
table of contents value accounting provided for under sfas requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
according to apb  no compensation expense is recognized since the exercise price of our stock options generally equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
adoption of sfas for options issued to employees would require recognition of employee compensation expense based on the computed fair value of the options on the date of grant 
in accordance with sfas and eitf issue  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods and services  stock options and warrants issued to consultants and other non employees as compensation for services to be provided to us are accounted for based upon the fair value of the services provided or the estimated fair market value of the option or warrant  whichever can be more clearly determined 
we recognize this expense over the period the services are provided 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas and supersedes apb statement no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
as required  we will adopt statement no 
r during our quarter ending september  under statement no 
r  we may either recognize compensation cost for share based payments to employees based on the grant date fair value from the beginning of the period in which the provisions are first applied  without restating periods prior to adoption  or we may elect to restate prior periods by recognizing compensation costs in the amounts previously reported in our pro forma footnote disclosures under the provisions of sfas we are evaluating the impact of the two adoption methods and as yet have not determined which method we will utilize 
we cannot estimate the impact of adopting statement no 
r  but based solely upon the pro forma disclosures for prior periods  we believe that the impact may be material to our results of operations 
we do not anticipate that adoption of statement no 
r will materially impact our financial condition 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page f of this transition report on form k  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as reported on the company s current report on form k dated november   the company changed its fiscal year from june to december  implementing such change for the six months ended december  results of operations general in october  the company entered into a research collaboration and an exclusive license agreement with les laboratoires servier servier

the agreement with organon also includes milestone payments based upon clinical development  plus royalty payments on worldwide sales 
cortex achieved its first milestone under the agreement in may  when organon selected a candidate compound to pursue in phase i clinical testing as a treatment for schizophrenia 
achieving this milestone triggered a  payment from organon  which cortex recorded as revenue upon achievement 
cortex achieved its second milestone under the agreement in september  when organon elected to continue development of the selected compound in phase ii clinical testing 
achieving the second milestone triggered another  payment from organon  with the related revenue recorded upon achievement of the milestone

cortex recorded the revenue related to this milestone upon its achievement 
from inception february  through december   the company sustained losses aggregating  due to projected fluctuations in funding  continuing losses are likely over the next several years  as the company s ongoing operating expenses will only be offset  if at all  by research support payments and possible milestone payments from its research collaborations with servier and organon  or under planned strategic alliances that the company is seeking with other pharmaceutical companies for the clinical development  manufacturing and marketing of its products 
the nature and timing of payments to cortex under the servier and organon agreements or other planned strategic alliances  if and when entered into  are likely to significantly affect the company s operations and financing activities and to produce substantial period to period fluctuations in reported financial results 
over the longer term  the company will require successful commercial development of its products by servier  organon  or its other prospective partners to attain sustained profitable operations from royalties or other product based revenues 
the company believes that inflation and changing prices have not had a material impact on its ongoing operations to date

commitments for preclinical and clinical development expenses approximate  all of which is payable within the next months 
in june  the company received  from the institute for the study of aging the institute  which will partially offset the company s costs for the testing in patients with mci 
given that cortex committed to use the funding from the institute solely for clinical trials  the company recorded the amounts received as restricted cash in its balance sheet 
provided that cortex complies with the conditions of the funding agreement  repayment of the advance shall not be required unless cortex enters an ampakine compound into phase iii clinical trials for alzheimer s disease 
upon such potential clinical trials  repayment would include interest computed at a rate equal to one half of the prime lending rate 
in lieu of cash  in the event of repayment the institute may elect to receive the balance of outstanding principal and accrued interest as shares of cortex common stock 
the conversion price for such form of repayment shall initially equal per share  subject to adjustment under certain circumstances

cortex anticipates a modest increase in the number of its full time employees within the coming year 

table of contents plant and equipment the company expects that it will require modest investments in plant and equipment within the coming year 
outlook cortex anticipates that its cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and scheduled research support payments from its agreements with servier will be sufficient to satisfy the company s capital requirements through calendar year additional funds will be required to continue operations beyond that time 
cortex may receive additional milestone payments from the organon and servier agreements  but there is no assurance that the company will receive such milestone payments within the desired timeframe  or at all 
cortex may also receive funds from the exercise of warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
as of december   warrants to purchase up to approximately million shares of our common stock were outstanding 
if these warrants are fully exercised  of which there can be no assurance  such exercise would provide approximately  of additional capital 
see risk factors risks related to our business we will need additional capital in the future and  if it is not available on terms acceptable to us  or at all  we may need to scale back our research and development efforts and may be unable to continue our business operations 
in order to provide for its longer term spending requirements  the company is presently seeking collaborative or other arrangements with larger pharmaceutical companies 
under these agreements  it is intended that such companies would provide additional capital to the company in exchange for exclusive or non exclusive license or other rights to certain of the technologies and products the company is developing 
competition for such arrangements is intense  with a large number of biopharmaceutical companies attempting to secure alliances with more established pharmaceutical companies 
although the company has been engaged in discussions with candidate companies  there is no assurance that an agreement or agreements will arise from these discussions in a timely manner  or at all  or that revenues that may be generated thereby will offset operating expenses sufficiently to reduce the company s short and longer term funding requirements 
because there is no assurance that the company will secure additional corporate partnerships  the company may raise additional capital through the sale of debt or equity securities 
there is no assurance that funds will be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if equity securities are issued to raise additional funds  dilution to existing stockholders may result 
the company s proposed products are in the preclinical or early clinical stage of development and will require significant further research  development  clinical testing and regulatory clearances 
they are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of products based on innovative technologies 
these risks include the possibilities that any or all of the proposed products will be found to be ineffective or unsafe  or otherwise fail to receive necessary regulatory clearances  that the proposed products  although effective  will be uneconomical to market  that third parties may now or in the future hold proprietary rights that preclude the company from marketing them  or that third parties will market superior or equivalent products 
accordingly  the company is unable to predict whether its research and development activities will result in any commercially viable products or applications 
further  due to the extended testing and regulatory review process required before marketing clearance can be obtained  the company does not expect to be able to commercialize any therapeutic drug for at least five years  either directly or through its prospective corporate partners or licensees 
there can be no assurance that the company s proposed products will prove to be safe or effective or receive regulatory approvals that are required for commercial sale

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks associated with interest rate fluctuations on its marketable securities and borrowing arrangement 
all investments in marketable securities are entered into for purposes other than trading 
the company is not subject to risks from currency rate fluctuations as it does not typically conduct transactions in foreign currencies 
in addition  the company does not utilize hedging contracts or similar instruments 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk arises from financial instruments entered into in the normal course of business 
certain of the company s financial instruments are fixed rate  short term investments in government and corporate notes and bonds  which are available for sale and have been marked to market in the accompanying financial statements 
changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the investments  however  because these financial instruments are considered available for sale  all such changes are reflected in the financial statements in the period affected 
the company manages interest rate risk on its investment portfolio by matching scheduled investment maturities with its cash requirements 
as of december   the company s investment portfolio had a carrying amount of approximately  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december   the resulting decline in the fair value of fixed rate bonds held within the portfolio would not be material to the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the company s borrowing consists solely of its advance from the institute  which is subject to potential repayment in the event that cortex enters an ampakine compound into phase iii clinical testing as a potential treatment for alzheimer s disease 
potential repayment would include interest accruing at a discount to the prime lending rate 
changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of such debt  but  based upon historical activity  such changes are not expected to have a material impact on earnings or cash flows 
as of december   the principal and accrued interest of the advance amounted to approximately
