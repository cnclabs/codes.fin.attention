item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data  and the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
see also forward looking statements on page rpc  inc rpc provides a broad range of specialized oilfield services primarily to independent and major oilfield companies engaged in exploration  production and development of oil and gas properties throughout the united states  including the gulf of mexico  mid continent  southwest and rocky mountain regions  and selected international locations 
the company s revenues and profits are generated by providing equipment and services to customers who operate oil and gas properties and invest capital to drill new wells and enhance production or perform maintenance on existing wells 
our key business and financial strategies are to focus our management resources on and invest our capital in equipment and geographic markets that we believe will earn high returns on capital  and maintain a conservative capital structure including low debt levels 
to maintain a flexible cost structure that can respond quickly to volatile industry conditions and business activity levels 
to deliver equipment and services to our customers safely 
to maximize shareholder return by optimizing the balance between cash invested in the company s productive assets  the payment of dividends to shareholders  and the repurchase of its common stock on the open market 
to align the interests of our management and shareholders 
in assessing the outcomes of these strategies and rpc s financial condition and operating performance  management generally reviews periodic forecast data  monthly actual results  and other similar information 
we also consider trends related to certain key financial data  including revenues  utilization of our equipment and personnel  pricing for our services and equipment  profit margins  selling  general and administrative expenses and cash flows 
we continuously monitor factors that impact the level of current and expected customer activity levels  such as the price of oil and natural gas  changes in pricing and utilization 
our financial results are affected by geopolitical factors such as political instability in the petroleum producing regions of the world  overall economic conditions and weather in the united states  the prices of oil and natural gas  and our customers drilling and production activities 
current industry conditions include historically high but stable natural gas prices  historically high  volatile oil prices  and a gradually increasing domestic rig count 
these trends in resulted in increased utilization of our equipment and personnel followed by increased pricing for the company s services and equipment 
improved results have also allowed us to make higher capital expenditures  which has led to an increase in capacity for providing services to our customers 
the results of our strategies are reflected in our financial and operational performance 
we generated record revenues and profitability in because of better industry conditions  increased capacity  and growth in the utilization of our personnel and equipment 
revenues in of million increased percent compared to the prior year 
the growth in revenues resulted primarily from increased utilization consistent with higher customer activity levels and to a lesser extent  our ability to increase our pricing for our equipment and services 
international revenues for all of grew by percent mainly due to our focus on several international business opportunities 
we continue to focus on developing international growth opportunities  however  it is difficult to predict when contracts and projects will be initiated and their ultimate duration 
based on current industry conditions and trends during the first two months of  we expect consolidated revenues for to increase  although the volatility in our industry makes accurate near term forecasts unreliable 
during the fourth quarter  we sold certain non core operating assets generating proceeds of approximately million and a pretax gain of approximately million  or adjusted for the three for two stock split per diluted share 
earnings before income taxes increased to million in compared to million in the prior year 
the effective tax rate in of percent was lower than the rate of percent in because we recognized previously reserved foreign tax credits and made adjustments to liabilities for foreign taxes 
diluted earnings per share increased to adjusted for the three for two stock split in compared to adjusted for the three for two stock split in the prior year 
cash flows from operating activities were million compared to million in the prior year  and cash and cash equivalents were million at december   an increase of million compared to the prior year 
this increase in cash and cash equivalents resulted primarily from improved operating results coupled with million of proceeds generated from the sale of liftboats in the fourth quarter of  offset by increased capital expenditures and contributions to the defined benefit pension plan 
our financial condition remains strong as our debt to capitalization remains at less than three percent as of december  cost of services rendered and goods sold as a percentage of revenues decreased approximately five percent in compared to this improvement was due to leveraging our direct costs with higher revenues as a result of increased utilization and improved pricing 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues remained relatively stable at percent  but increased consistent with the increase in revenues due to increased incentive compensation costs and increased headcount related to higher activity levels and the expansion of our safety program  the implementation of additional information technology to support operational efficiencies at higher activity levels  and an increase in bad debt expense 
consistent with our strategy to selectively grow our capacity and maintain our existing fleet of high demand equipment  capital expenditures were million in the actual amount of expenditures will depend primarily on equipment maintenance requirements and expansion opportunities  although we currently expect capital expenditures to be approximately million in consistent with  we expect these expenditures to be primarily directed toward our larger  core service lines including pressure pumping  snubbing  nitrogen  and rental tools 
outlook drilling activity in the us domestic oilfields  as measured by the rotary drilling rig count  has been stable or gradually increasing for several years  and the overall domestic rig count during the first two months of is approximately percent higher than in the comparable period in the price of oil has risen by approximately percent and the price of natural gas has risen by approximately percent during this period as well 
while the overall drilling rig count has increased  drilling activity in the gulf of mexico remains weak  which is unfavorable because of the company s historical presence in this geographic market 
the company has responded to these trends by emphasizing investments in more robust domestic markets and making only selective investments in the gulf of mexico market 
in spite of relatively stable industry conditions  the company understands that factors influencing the industry are unpredictable 
our response to the industry s potential uncertainty is to maintain sufficient liquidity and a conservative capital structure 
on january   rpc s board of directors declared a three for two stock split of the company s common shares 
the additional shares were distributed on march  to stockholders of record on february  all share  earning per share  and dividends per share data have been adjusted to reflect this stock split 
our ability to sustain our recent growth in revenues and profitability will depend upon a number of factors  including our ability to expand the business generated by our core service lines including geographic expansion and continue to improve operating efficiencies and organizational effectiveness 
numerous factors can affect our ability to achieve these goals  including without limitation  us and global economic conditions  increased competition from other oilfield service companies  increased cost of equipment  delays in receiving equipment  availability and cost of qualified personnel  tensions in the middle east and other oil producing nations  demand for oil in rapidly industrializing economies such as china and india  and the weather in the united states during results of operations years ended december  consolidated revenues revenues by business segment technical support other consolidated operating profit loss operating profit loss by business segment technical support other corporate expenses net income loss earnings loss per share diluted adjusted for three for two stock split percentage cost of services rendered and goods sold to revenues percentage selling  general and administrative expenses to revenues percentage depreciation and amortization expense to revenues effective income tax rate average us domestic rig count average natural gas price per thousand cubic feet mcf average oil price per barrel year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues for increased percent compared to domestic revenues increased due to higher customer drilling and production enhancement activity 
our growth in revenues was higher than the domestic rig count growth  principally because of the effect of increased international revenues  of an acquisition closed during and of our new fishing tool service line which began operations in these increases were partially offset by continued weakness in the gulf of mexico market  exacerbated by the hurricanes in the area during the third quarter  heavy rains during the fourth quarter impacting mid continent operations  and the sale of one of our non oilfield businesses during the second quarter of the average price of natural gas increased percent during compared to  and the average price of oil increased percent during the same period 
the average us domestic rig count increased by percent during compared to this increase in oil and gas prices and resulting increase in drilling activity had a positive impact on our financial results 
we believe that our activity levels are affected more by natural gas prices than by the price of oil  because the majority of us domestic drilling activity relates to natural gas  and many of our services are more appropriate for gas wells than oil wells 
the correlation between the changes in the price of oil and natural gas and us domestic drilling activity were more highly correlated in than in this higher correlation is consistent with past industry cycles 
the technical services segment revenues for increased percent due primarily to increased customer activity levels and demand for our services  additional equipment capacity  higher pricing levels in most of our service lines and a shift in the mix of pressure pumping work towards higher revenue generating jobs 
the support services segment revenues for increased percent as a result of higher equipment utilization  additional capacity and slightly higher pricing in rental tools  which is the largest service line within this segment  partially offset by lower utilization and reduced pricing for our marine liftboats 
cost of services rendered and goods sold 
cost of services rendered and goods sold  as a percentage of revenues  decreased five percentage points in compared to as a result of improved operating leverage due to overall higher utilization of personnel and operating equipment  and better pricing 
cost of services rendered and goods sold increased percent due primarily to increased direct employment costs  and variable operational expenses such as equipment maintenance  materials and supplies  sub rental expense and fuel costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by percent to million in from million in  however as a percentage of revenues  remained relatively stable at percent 
the increase was due to increased incentive compensation costs and increased headcount related to higher activity levels and the expansion of our safety program 
the increase was also due to the implementation of additional information technology to support operational efficiencies at higher activity levels and an increase in bad debt expense 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization were million in  a percent increase compared to million in this increase in depreciation and amortization resulted from various maintenance and growth capital expenditures within support services and technical services  and from the effect of the acquisition completed during the second quarter of as a percentage of revenues these costs declined due to their fixed nature 
other income  net 
other income  net for includes a gain of approximately million related to the sale of the company s domestic liftboat fleet during the fourth quarter of this transaction generated proceeds of approximately million 
other income also includes gains in and related to miscellaneous real property dispositions  sales to customers of lost or damaged rental equipment  and gains from various legal and insurance claim settlements 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net was thousand in compared to thousand in income tax provision 
the effective tax rate in was percent  a reduction from percent in  primarily because of an aggregate reduction in the tax provision of approximately million related to the recognition of previously reserved foreign tax credit carryovers and an adjustment to the liabilities for foreign taxes 
net income and diluted earnings per share 
net income for was million  or adjusted for three for two stock split diluted earnings per share 
this included the million after tax gain  or adjusted for three for two stock split per diluted share  related to the sale of the liftboats and million  or adjusted for three for two stock split per diluted share  related to the tax provision adjustments 
net income for was million or adjusted for three for two stock split diluted earnings per share 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues for increased percent compared to as a result of higher utilization of equipment and personnel  increased pricing in most of our service lines and the impact of the bronco oilfield services acquisition completed at the beginning of the second quarter of during  the average domestic rig count increased percent compared to the average price of natural gas increased percent during compared to  while the average price of oil increased percent during the same period 
this increase in oil and gas prices had a positive impact on our financial results especially the greater increase in gas prices  because we believe that our activity levels are affected more by natural gas prices than by the price of oil 
although the prices of oil and natural gas in were significantly higher than in  the higher prices and the increase in drilling activity did not correlate as closely as in past cycles 
if this continues  then it is possible that rising oil and gas prices in the future may not necessarily indicate an increase in our activity levels  as they have historically 
technical services revenues increased percent in compared to as a result of higher utilization of equipment and personnel  increased pricing in most service lines and the impact of the bronco oilfield services acquisition completed at the beginning of the second quarter of support services revenues increased percent in compared to the prior year  as a result of higher utilization of equipment slightly offset by a decrease in pricing 
part of this revenue increase was due to increased utilization of the company s marine liftboats  which were involved in a long term  non oilfield related project during most of support services revenues experienced a relatively lower revenue increase than technical services due to this segment s presence in the gulf of mexico geographic market 
drilling activity in the gulf of mexico was much weaker than in other parts of the us domestic market  and as measured by the rig count  declined during compared to cost of services rendered and goods sold 
cost of services rendered and goods sold  as a percentage of revenues  decreased seven percentage points because of higher utilization of equipment and personnel 
cost of services rendered and goods sold increased percent due to higher customer activity levels  because many of these costs vary directly with activity 
in particular  materials and supplies expense  insurance and overtime personnel expense increased compared to selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in  an increase of percent 
these expenses increased primarily because of higher personnel and incentive compensation expense consistent with increased activity levels and profitability  and increased pension expense relating to the company s pension plan obligation 
as a percentage of revenues  these costs decreased two percentage points due to improved operating leverage 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization were million in  a six percent increase compared to million in the increase in depreciation and amortization resulted from the cumulative effect of the higher levels of growth capital expenditures 
interest expense income  net 
interest expense was thousand in compared to thousand in other income  net 
other income  net in includes a gain from the settlement of an insurance claim  proceeds from a settlement of a dispute with a vendor  and gains related to the sale of operating equipment  partially offset by the recognition of a loss sustained on damaged operating equipment 
during  other income included primarily gains relating to the sale of operating equipment  proceeds from the settlement of a lawsuit  and a gain from the sale of a small business unit 
income tax provision benefit 
the effective income tax rate for was percent while the rate for was percent 
the slight increase in the book effective tax rate is due to the effect of permanent differences between book and taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows the following table sets forth the historical cash flows for the twelve months ended december in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investing activities net cash used for financing activities cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the large improvement in operating results was offset by a million cash contribution to the defined benefit pension plan  receipt of large income tax refunds in that did not recur in  and higher working capital requirements 
increased revenues resulted in an increase in accounts receivable which was partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities 
cash used in investing activities for increased by million compared to  primarily as a result of an increase in capital expenditures partially offset by an increase in proceeds from sale of property and equipment  including the sale of the liftboats  and a decrease in cash used for purchases of businesses 
cash used for purchases of businesses in includes earnout payments of million related to operating results 
cash used for purchases of businesses in included a business acquisition  there were no earnout payments in cash used in financing activities for increased by million compared to  due to increases in dividends paid per share and debt service requirements  partially offset by increases in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options 
cash provided by operating activities for increased million  or percent  compared to the increase was primarily due to improved operating results coupled with receipt of a tax refund in resulting from carryback of prior year net operating losses 
these increases were partially offset by higher working capital requirements including an increase in accounts receivable due to higher revenues partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities consistent with higher business activity levels 
cash used in investing activities for increased million  or percent  compared to  primarily as a result of an increase in capital expenditures and a business acquisition 
cash used in financing activities for increased million  or percent  compared to the increase is primarily a result of lower debt service requirements partially offset by higher repurchases in the open market of the company s stock 
the company purchased  shares of its common stock on the open market during financial condition and liquidity the company s financial condition as of december   was strong 
we believe the liquidity provided by our existing cash and cash equivalents  our overall strong capitalization  which includes access to a million credit facility with a financial institution  of which million was available as of december   and cash expected to be generated from operations  will provide sufficient capital to meet our requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the portion of the credit facility that is not currently available supports letters of credit relating to self insurance programs or contract bids 
the company s decisions about the amount of cash to be used for investing and financing purposes are influenced by its capital position and the expected amount of cash to be provided by operations 
we believe our liquidity will allow us to grow our asset base and revenues as improvements occur in business conditions and customer activity levels 
cash requirements capital expenditures were million in  and we currently expect capital expenditures to be approximately million in the actual amount of expenditures will depend primarily on equipment maintenance requirements and expansion opportunities 
we expect that additional contributions to the defined benefit pension plan of approximately million will be required in to achieve the company s funding objective 
on january   the board of directors approved a percent increase in the quarterly cash dividend  from to to be paid march  to shareholders of record on february  based on the shares outstanding on december   the aggregate annual amount would be approximately million 
the company expects to continue to pay cash dividends to the common stockholders  subject to the earnings and financial condition of the company and other relevant factors 
in accordance with the respective purchase agreements  earnout payments to sellers of acquired businesses may be paid on an annual basis 
the company anticipates that earnout payments of approximately million will be made in related to operating results 
in february  the company prepaid a promissory note totaling million 
contractual obligations the company s obligations and commitments that require future payments include notes payable in connection with acquisitions  a bank demand note  certain non cancelable operating leases  purchase obligations and other long term liabilities 
the following table summarizes the company s significant contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations in february  the company prepaid a million promissory note which extinguished a portion of this debt 
operating leases include agreements for various office locations  office equipment  and certain operating equipment 
as part of the normal course of business the company enters into purchase commitments to manage its various operating needs 
however  the company does not have any obligations that are non cancelable or subject to a penalty if canceled 
includes expected cash payments for long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet where the timing of the payments are known 
these amounts include primarily known pension plan funding obligations  earnout payments  and incentive compensation 
these amounts exclude pension obligations with uncertain funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities 
inflation the company purchases its equipment and materials from suppliers who provide competitive prices 
due to the recent increases in activity in the domestic oilfield  the company has experienced some upward wage pressures in the labor markets from which it hires employees 
if inflation in the general economy increases  the company s costs for equipment  materials and labor could increase as well 
during  the price of steel  for both the commodity and for products manufactured with steel  rose dramatically due to increased worldwide demand 
this affected the company s operations through delays in scheduled deliveries of new equipment and price quotations that were only valid for a limited period of time 
steel prices remained high as of december  if steel prices remain high  delays in scheduled deliveries of new equipment will continue  and it is likely that the cost of the company s new equipment will increase 
these increases would result in higher capital expenditures and depreciation expense 
rpc may not be able to recover such increased costs through price increases to its customers  thereby reducing the company s future profits 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any material off balance sheet arrangements 
related party transactions marine products corporation effective february   the company spun off the business conducted through chaparral boats  inc chaparral  rpc s former powerboat manufacturing segment 
rpc accomplished the spin off by contributing percent of the issued and outstanding stock of chaparral to marine products corporation a delaware corporation marine products  a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of rpc  and then distributing the common stock of marine products to rpc stockholders 
in conjunction with the spin off  rpc and marine products entered into various agreements that define the companies relationship 
in accordance with a transition support services agreement  which may be terminated by either party  rpc provides certain administrative services  including financial reporting and income tax administration  acquisition assistance  etc  to marine products 
charges from the company or from corporations that are subsidiaries of the company for such services aggregated approximately  in   in and  in the company s directors are also directors of marine products and all of the executive officers are employees of both the company and marine products 
the employee benefits agreement provides for  among other things  marine products to participate in two rpc sponsored benefit plans  specifically  the defined contribution k plan and the defined benefit retirement income plan 
following the spin off  rpc charged marine products for  and marine products has been obligated to pay  its allocable share of pension costs and the associated funding obligation related to the prior service liabilities of chaparral employees 
effective december  the related prior service liabilities totaling  and pension assets totaling  were transferred within the multiple employer plan from rpc to marine products 
accordingly  during  the pension costs and funding obligations were incurred directly by marine products 
the tax sharing and indemnification agreement provides for  among other things  the treatment of income tax matters for periods through the date of the spin off and responsibility for any adjustments as a result of audit by any taxing authority 
the general terms provide for the indemnification for any tax detriment incurred by one party caused by the other party s action 
the amounts transferred as settlements from rpc to marine products totaled approximately  in  in and  in other the company periodically purchases in the ordinary course of business products or services from suppliers  who are owned by significant officers or shareholders  or affiliated with the directors of rpc 
the total amounts paid to these affiliated parties were approximately  in and  in in addition  the overhead crane fabrication division of rpc recorded  in and  in in revenues from the powerboat manufacturing segment that is now a subsidiary of marine products pursuant to the spin off  related to the sale  installation and service of overhead cranes 
rpc receives certain administrative services and rents office space from rollins  inc a company of which mr 
r 
randall rollins is also chairman 
the service agreements between rollins  inc and the company provide for the provision of services on a cost reimbursement basis and are terminable on six months notice 
the services covered by these agreements include office space  administration of certain employee benefit programs  and other administrative services 
charges to the company or to corporations which are subsidiaries of the company for such services and rent aggregated  in and  in critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating accounting estimates 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  trends in the industry  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies involve estimates that require a higher degree of judgment and complexity allowance for doubtful accounts substantially all of the company s receivables are due from oil and gas exploration and production companies in the united states  selected international locations and foreign  nationally owned oil companies 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using a combination of factors to ensure that our receivables are not overstated due to uncollectibility 
our established credit evaluation procedures seek to minimize the amount of business we conduct with higher risk customers 
our customers ability to pay is directly related to their ability to generate cash flow on their projects and is significantly affected by the volatility in the price of oil and natural gas 
provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
accounts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when the company determines that amounts are uncollectible and recoveries of amounts previously written off are recorded when collected 
significant recoveries will generally reduce the required provision in the period of recovery 
therefore  the provision for doubtful accounts can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
in and  the company recorded four large recoveries of previously charged off amounts from three different customers 
there were no large recoveries in we record specific provisions when we become aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position 
if circumstances related to customers change  our estimates of the realizability of receivables would be further adjusted  either upward or downward 
the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our evaluation of the overall trends in the oil and gas industry  financial condition of our customers  our historical write off experience  current economic conditions  and in the case of international customers  our judgments about the economic and political environment of the related country and region 
in addition to reserves established for specific customers  we establish general reserves by using different percentages depending on the age of the receivables 
excluding the effect of the recoveries referred to above  the annual provisions for doubtful accounts have ranged from percent to percent of revenues over the last three years 
increasing or decreasing the estimated general reserve percentages by percentage points as of december  would have resulted in a change of approximately million to the allowance for doubtful accounts and a corresponding change to selling  general and administrative expenses 
income taxes the effective income tax rates were percent in  percent in  and percent in our effective tax rates vary due to changes in estimates of our future taxable income  fluctuations in the tax jurisdictions in which our earnings and deductions are realized  and favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities related to proposed or probable assessments 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis 
we establish a valuation allowance against the carrying value of deferred tax assets when we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized through future taxable income 
such amounts are charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance 
we have considered future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified  which is generally in the third quarter of the subsequent year for us federal and state provisions 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the year the differences are expected to reverse 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
additionally  the jurisdictions in which our earnings or deductions are realized may differ from our current estimates 
during the company re evaluated its estimated tax exposures in various international tax jurisdictions based on our projected international business development opportunities 
based on this review  we reduced our liabilities for foreign taxes and our tax provision by million to reflect the estimated change which lowered the effective tax rate by approximately percentage points 
insurance expenses the company self insures  up to certain policy specified limits  certain risks related to general liability  workers compensation  vehicle and equipment liability 
the cost of claims under these self insurance programs is estimated and accrued using individual case based valuations and statistical analysis and is based upon judgment and historical experience  however  the ultimate cost of many of these claims may not be known for several years 
these claims are monitored and the cost estimates are revised as developments occur relating to such claims 
the company has retained an independent third party actuary to assist in the calculation of a range of exposure for these claims 
as of december   the company estimates the range of exposure to be from million to million 
the company has recorded liabilities at december  of approximately million which represents management s best estimate of probable loss 
depreciable life of assets rpc s net property  plant and equipment at december  was million representing percent of the company s consolidated assets 
depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended december  were million  or percent of total operating costs 
management judgment is required in the determination of the estimated useful lives used to calculate the annual and accumulated depreciation and amortization expense 
property  plant and equipment are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization  which is generally provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the estimated useful life represents the projected period of time that the asset will be productively employed by the company and is determined by management based on many factors including historical experience with similar assets 
assets are monitored to ensure changes in asset lives  are identified and prospective depreciation and amortization expense is adjusted accordingly 
we have not made any changes to the estimated lives of assets resulting in a material impact in the last three years 
defined benefit pension plan in  the company ceased all future benefit accruals under the defined benefit plan  although the company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through march the company accounts for the defined benefit plan in accordance with the provisions of sfas  employers accounting for pensions and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs 
with the assistance of the actuary  the company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets  the discount rate  and other factors  and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary 
the company chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes  the investments strategy  and the views of our investment adviser 
differences between the expected long term return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over future years 
therefore  the net deferral of past asset gains losses ultimately affects future pension expense 
the company s assumption for the expected return on plan assets is percent which is unchanged from the prior year 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company utilizes the moody s aa long term corporate bond yield with a yield adjustment made for the longer duration of the company s obligations 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations 
the company determined a discount rate of percent as of december   compared to a discount rate of percent in and percent in in  the change in the minimum pension liability within accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased stockholders equity by million after tax 
holding all other factors constant  a decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by percentage points would result in an after tax increase of approximately million in accumulated other comprehensive loss and an increase in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by percentage points would result in an after tax decrease of approximately million in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the company recognized pretax pension expense of million in  million in  and million in pension expense is anticipated to remain relatively unchanged at approximately million in holding all other factors constant  a change in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets by percentage points would result in an increase or decrease in pension expense of approximately million in holding all other factors constant  a change in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by percentage points would result in an increase or decrease in pension expense of approximately million in new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
revised sfas r  employers disclosures about pensions and other post retirement benefits 
sfas r does not change the measurement or recognition provisions for defined benefit pensions and other post retirement benefits  however  it requires additional annual disclosures about assets  obligations  cash flows  net periodic benefit cost and projected benefit payments of those plans 
the company has adopted the provisions of sfas r and presented the disclosures in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf applies to investments accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments held by not for profit organizations 
in september  the fasb delayed the accounting provisions of eitf no 
 however  qualitative and quantitative disclosures are effective for the fiscal year ending december  the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on the financial position  results of operations or liquidity of the company 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
among other provisions  the new rule requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal as stated in arb no 
additionally  sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and is required to be adopted by the company in the first quarter of fiscal  beginning on january  the company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition but does not expect sfas to have a material impact 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period that begins after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
the company is required to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of fiscal under sfas r  the company must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include the modified prospective application and the modified retrospective application 
under the modified retrospective application  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the modified prospective application requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the modified retrospective application would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of applying the various provisions of sfas r 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions sfas 
the amendments made by sfas are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
previously  opinion required that the accounting for an exchange of productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive asset should be based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished

management s report on internal control over financial reporting to the stockholders of rpc  inc the management of rpc  inc is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company 
rpc  inc maintains a system of internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance  at a reasonable cost  that assets are safeguarded against loss or unauthorized use and that the financial records are adequate and can be relied upon to produce financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the internal control system is augmented by written policies and procedures  an internal audit program and the selection and training of qualified personnel 
this system includes policies that require adherence to ethical business standards and compliance with all applicable laws and regulations 
there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any controls system 
a controls system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met 
also  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and any instances of fraud  if any  within the company will be detected 
further  the design of a controls system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
the company intends to continually improve and refine its internal controls 
under the supervision and with the participation of our management  including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer  we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures  as required by rules a and d under the securities exchange act of  as of december  based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission

rpc  inc s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 
our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states 
those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects 
our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting  evaluating management s assessment  testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control  and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances 
we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 
a company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
a company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that  in reasonable detail  accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company  and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition  use  or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
also  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
in our opinion  management s assessment that rpc  inc maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december   is fairly stated  in all material respects  based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the coso 
also in our opinion  rpc  inc maintained  in all material respects  effective internal control over financial reporting as of december   based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the coso
