item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of our results of operations and financial position for the periods described below 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
general strategic distribution  inc and subsidiaries the company provides supply chain management services with respect to maintenance  repair and operating mro supplies for industrial and institutional customers in the united states and mexico 
the company conducts it us operations primarily through its wholly owned subsidiary  sdi  inc sdi 
as a result of the termination of service agreements with customers during and and the slowdown of the introduction of new sites  the company s revenues for the year ended december  were below those reported for the year ended december  the termination of contracts with customers throughout fiscal customers and customers was the primary cause of the revenue reduction 
in marketing to prospective customers  the company has modified its offering to place more emphasis upon the value added supply chain management services it provides and a decreased emphasis upon mro supply sales 
in this connection  the company has enhanced its service offering by adding additional system capabilities and providing more flexible solutions  including in site online designed for smaller sites where a comprehensive in plant store is not economically justified 
the company s marketing efforts are focused on driving future business to a fee for services model 
in addition  traditionally the company carried inventory on behalf of its customers without adequate compensation 
the company is endeavoring to limit its obligations to carry inventory with new customers 
the company believes these changes in its offering combined with intensifying mro supply pricing pressure have been primarily responsible for lengthening its sales cycle and limiting its success in securing new customers 
the company believes that its modified offerings will gain market acceptance as customers come to understand the company s value proposition  but there is no guarantee concerning whether or when such market acceptance will occur 
revenue changes in the company s remaining business may cause future operating results to differ significantly from historical results reported 
future growth in the company s business is highly dependent on its ability to attract new customers 
the company has reduced and may continue to reduce its operating costs as a result of the revenue declines 
such cost reductions will likely be lower than the relative sales declines because of the fixed nature of certain costs and the determination by the company that certain costs are necessary to maintain and improve the company s technology and service offerings 
critical accounting policies the sec has issued cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and may change materially in subsequent periods 
the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes 
significant estimates made by the company include the following reserves and accrued liabilities the company provides reserves and accrued liabilities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for events such as site closures  to record assets at estimated net realizable values and to record probable contingent liabilities 
in addition  in the ordinary course of business  management makes estimates of accrued liabilities to suppliers and other service providers 
the amounts of such reserves and accrued liabilities are based on information and assumptions that the company deems reasonable and probable at the time 
the matters that give rise to such provisions are inherently uncertain and require complex and subjective judgments 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the company s review and assessment of its customers ability to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances might be required 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  future realization of these assets in excess of the net amount recorded would increase income during that period 
likewise  should the company determine a greater possibility exists that it would not be able to realize part of or the entire net deferred tax asset in the future  a charge to income would result at the time the determination was made 
recoverability of assets the company makes significant estimates relating to the recoverability of assets  such as inventory and long lived assets 
the company s ability to recover the value of its inventory depends on a number of factors  including the financial condition of its customers  the effect of changes in economic conditions and its ability to enforce provisions of its contracts in the event of disputes  through litigation if necessary 
the recoverability of long lived assets is highly dependant on the company s business volume and application of the applicable accounting standards requires significant judgments and estimates 
although the company believes the estimates and assumptions used in determining the recorded amounts of net assets and liabilities at december  are reasonable  actual results could differ materially from estimated amounts recorded in the company s consolidated financial statements
