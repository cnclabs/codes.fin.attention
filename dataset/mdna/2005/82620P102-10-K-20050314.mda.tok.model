item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation capital resources 
risk based capital ratio requirements are discussed in greater detail in the following section 
prompt corrective action provisions federal law requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured financial institutions  including but not limited to those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios 
the federal banking agencies have by regulation defined the following five capital categories well capitalized total risk based capital ratio of  tier risk based capital ratio of  and leverage ratio of  adequately capitalized total risk based capital ratio of  tier risk based capital ratio of  and leverage ratio of  or if the institution receives the highest rating from its primary regulator  undercapitalized total risk based capital ratio of less than  tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or leverage ratio of less than  or if the institution receives the highest rating from its primary regulator  significantly undercapitalized total risk based capital ratio of less than  tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or leverage ratio less than  and critically undercapitalized tangible equity to total assets less than 
as of december  and  the bank was deemed to be well capitalized for regulatory capital purposes 
a bank may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if after notice and the opportunity for a hearing  the appropriate federal agency finds an unsafe or unsound condition or practice so warrants  but no bank may be treated as critically undercapitalized unless its actual capital ratio warrants such treatment 

table of contents at each successively lower capital category  an insured bank is subject to increased restrictions on its operations 
for example  a bank is generally prohibited from paying management fees to any controlling persons or from making capital distributions if to do so would make the bank undercapitalized 
asset growth and branching restrictions apply to undercapitalized banks  which are required to submit written capital restoration plans meeting specified requirements including a guarantee by the parent holding company  if any 
significantly undercapitalized banks are subject to broad regulatory authority  including among other things  capital directives  forced mergers  restrictions on the rates of interest they may pay on deposits  restrictions on asset growth and activities  and prohibitions on paying certain bonuses without fdic approval 
even more severe restrictions apply to critically undercapitalized banks 
most importantly  except under limited circumstances  not later than days after an insured bank becomes critically undercapitalized the appropriate federal banking agency is required to appoint a conservator or receiver for the bank 
in addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions  insured banks may be subject to potential actions by the federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law  rule  regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency 
enforcement actions may include the issuance of cease and desist orders  termination of insurance of deposits in the case of a bank  the imposition of civil money penalties  the issuance of directives to increase capital  formal and informal agreements  or removal and prohibition orders against institution affiliated parties 
safety and soundness standards the federal banking agencies have also adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards for all insured depository institutions 
those guidelines relate to internal controls  information systems  internal audit systems  loan underwriting and documentation  compensation and interest rate exposure 
in general  the standards are designed to assist the federal banking agencies in identifying and addressing problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired 
if an institution fails to meet these standards  the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to submit a compliance plan and institute enforcement proceedings if an acceptable compliance plan is not submitted 
premiums for deposit insurance the fdic regulations also implement a risk based premium system  whereby insured depository institutions are required to pay insurance premiums depending on their risk classification 
under this system  insured banks are categorized into one of three capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  and undercapitalized and one of three supervisory categories based on federal regulatory evaluations 
the three supervisory categories are financially sound with only a few minor weaknesses group a  demonstrates weaknesses that could result in significant deterioration group b  and poses a substantial probability of loss group c 
the capital ratios used by the fdic to define well capitalized  adequately capitalized and undercapitalized are the same in the fdic s prompt corrective action regulations 
the current base assessment rates expressed as cents per of deposits are summarized as follows group a group b group c well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized in addition  banks must pay an amount toward the retirement of financing corporation bonds issued in the s to assist in the recovery of the savings and loan industry 
this amount fluctuates but for the first quarter of is cents per of insured deposits 
community reinvestment act the bank is subject to certain requirements under the community reinvestment act cra 
the cra generally requires federal banking agencies to evaluate the record of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its 
table of contents local communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra further requires the agencies to consider a financial institution s efforts in meeting its community credit needs when evaluating applications for  among other things  domestic branches  consummating mergers or acquisitions  or holding company formations 
in measuring a bank s compliance with its cra obligations  the regulators utilize a performance based evaluation system 
they determine cra ratings based on the bank s actual lending  service and investment activities  rather than on the extent to which the institution conducts needs assessments  documents community outreach activities or complies with other procedural requirements 
in connection with its assessment of cra performance  the fdic assigns a rating of outstanding  satisfactory  needs to improve or substantial noncompliance 
the bank was last examined for cra compliance in july when it received a satisfactory cra assessment rating 
other consumer protection laws and regulations the bank regulatory agencies are increasingly focusing attention on compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations 
examination and enforcement has become intense  and banks have been advised to carefully monitor compliance with various consumer protection laws and regulations 
the federal interagency task force on fair lending issued a policy statement on discrimination in home mortgage lending describing three methods that federal agencies will use to prove discrimination overt evidence of discrimination  evidence of disparate treatment  and evidence of disparate impact 
in addition to cra and fair lending requirements  the bank is subject to numerous other federal consumer protection statutes and regulations 
due to heightened regulatory concern related to compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations generally  the bank may incur additional compliance costs or be required to expend additional funds for investments in the local communities it serves 
interstate banking and branching the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of the interstate banking act regulates the interstate activities of banks and bank holding companies and establishes a framework for nationwide interstate banking and branching 
since june   a bank has generally been permitted to merge with a bank in another state without the need for explicit state law authorization 
however  states were given the ability to prohibit interstate mergers with banks in their own state by opting out enacting state legislation applying equality to all out of state banks prohibiting such mergers prior to june  since  adequately capitalized and managed bank holding companies have been permitted to acquire banks located in any state  subject to two exceptions first  any state may still prohibit bank holding companies from acquiring a bank which is less than five years old  and second  no interstate acquisition can be consummated by a bank holding company if the acquirer would control more than of the deposits held by insured depository institutions nationwide or percent or more of the deposits held by insured depository institutions in any state in which the target bank has branches 
a bank may establish and operate de novo branches in any state in which the bank does not already maintain a branch if that state has enacted legislation to expressly permit all out of state banks to establish branches in that state 
in california enacted legislation to implement important provisions of the interstate banking act discussed above and to repeal california s previous interstate banking laws  which were largely preempted by the interstate banking act 
the changes effected by interstate banking act and california laws have increased competition in the environment in which the bank operates to the extent that out of state financial institutions directly or indirectly enter the bank s market areas 
it appears that the interstate banking act has contributed to accelerated consolidation within the banking industry 
financial modernization act effective march   the gramm leach bliley act also known as the financial modernization act enabled full affiliations to occur between banks and securities firms  insurance companies  and other financial service providers 
this legislation permits bank holding companies to become financial holding companies and thereby 
table of contents acquire securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature 
a bank holding company may become a financial holding company if each of its subsidiary banks is well capitalized and well managed under applicable definitions  and has at least a satisfactory rating under the cra  by filing a declaration that the bank holding company wishes to become a financial holding company 
no regulatory approval will be required for a financial holding company to acquire a company  other than a bank or savings association  engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature  as determined by the federal reserve board 
the company has no current intention of becoming a financial holding company  but may do at some point in the future if deemed appropriate in view of opportunities or circumstances at the time 
the financial modernization act defines financial in nature to include securities underwriting  dealing and market making  sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies  insurance underwriting and agency  merchant banking activities  and activities that the board has determined to be closely related to banking 
a national bank and therefore  a state bank as well may also engage  subject to limitations on investment  in activities that are financial in nature  other than insurance underwriting  insurance company portfolio investment  real estate development and real estate investment  through a financial subsidiary of the bank  if the bank is well capitalized  well managed and has at least a satisfactory cra rating 
subsidiary banks of a financial holding company or national banks with financial subsidiaries must continue to be well capitalized and well managed in order to continue to engage in activities that are financial in nature without regulatory actions or restrictions  which could include divestiture of financial subsidiaries 
in addition  a financial holding company or a bank may not acquire a company that is engaged in activities that are financial in nature unless each of the subsidiary banks of the financial holding company or the bank has a cra rating of satisfactory or better 
the financial modernization act also imposes extensive requirements on financial institutions with respect to the privacy of customer information  and modifies other existing laws  including those related to community reinvestment 
usa patriot act of on october   president bush signed the usa patriot act of the patriot act 
enacted in response to the terrorist attacks in new york  pennsylvania and washington  dc on september   the patriot act is intended to strengthen the ability of us law enforcement agencies and intelligence communities to work cohesively to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts 
the impact of the act on financial institutions is significant and wide ranging 
the act contains sweeping anti money laundering and financial transparency laws and requires various regulations applicable to financial institutions  including due diligence requirements for financial institutions that administer  maintain  or manage private bank accounts or correspondent accounts for non us persons  standards for verifying customer identification at account opening  and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions  regulators  and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering 
the company has incorporated the requirements of the patriot act into its operating procedures  and while these requirements have resulted in an additional time burden the financial impact on the company is difficult to quantify 
sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act of sarbanes oxley was enacted to increase corporate responsibility  provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies  and protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws 
sarbanes oxley includes important new requirements for public companies in the areas of financial disclosure  corporate governance  and the independence  composition and responsibilities of audit committees 
among other things  sarbanes oxley mandates chief executive and chief financial officer certifications of periodic financial reports  additional financial disclosures concerning off balance sheet items  and speedier transaction reporting requirements for executive officers  
table of contents directors and shareholders 
in addition  penalties for non compliance with the exchange act were heightened 
sec rules promulgated pursuant to sarbanes oxley impose obligations and restrictions on auditors and audit committees intended to enhance their independence from management  and include extensive additional disclosure  corporate governance and other related rules 
sarbanes oxley represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems  such as the regulation of the accounting profession  and to state corporate law  such as the relationship between a board of directors and management and between a board of directors and its committees 
the company has not experienced any significant difficulties in complying with sarbanes oxley 
however  the company has incurred  and expects to continue to incur  significant costs in connection with its compliance with section of sarbanes oxley  which requires management to undertake an assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of the company s internal controls over financial reporting and requires the company s auditors to attest to  and report on  management s assessment and the operating effectiveness of these controls 
the amount spent specifically for compliance with sarbanes oxley section totaled close to  in other pending and proposed legislation other legislative and regulatory initiatives which could affect the company  the bank and the banking industry in general are pending  and additional initiatives may be proposed or introduced before the united states congress  the california legislature and other governmental bodies in the future 
such proposals  if enacted  may further alter the structure  regulation and competitive relationship among financial institutions  and may subject the bank to increased regulation  disclosure and reporting requirements 
in addition  the various banking regulatory agencies often adopt new rules and regulations to implement and enforce existing legislation 
it cannot be predicted whether  or in what form  any such legislation or regulations may be enacted or the extent to which the business of the company or the bank would be affected thereby 
risk factors statements and financial discussion and analysis by management contained throughout this report that are not historical facts are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements herein include  without limitation  the factors set forth below 
poor economic conditions in our market areas may cause us to suffer higher default rates on our loans and leases 
a substantial majority of our assets and deposits are generated in the san joaquin valley in central california 
as a result  poor economic conditions in this region could cause us to incur losses associated with higher default rates and decreased collateral values in our loan portfolio 
the local economy currently appears to be experiencing a moderate expansion  and while the company expects continued improvement  no assurance can be given that this will occur 
the san joaquin valley has not experienced the same type of growth that has historically occurred in other areas of california  especially those where high tech industries have taken hold 
while this fact minimized the negative impact of the most recent recession  unemployment levels are still relatively high 
in the visalia tulare porterville metropolitan statistical area msa  for example  which is our geographic center and the base of our agriculturally oriented communities  the unemployment rate has consistently averaged around for the past several years 
while unemployment levels remain relatively high in all of the company s markets  in recent years some areas in the south and central san joaquin valley have experienced substantial commercial growth 
the area s relatively inexpensive real estate and central proximity to both southern and northern california have attracted a growing number of warehouse and distribution facilities  as well as manufacturing  health  and other service companies 
the low cost of housing has also drawn retirees from more expensive areas of california 

table of contents poor economic conditions affecting the agricultural industry could have an adverse effect on our customers and their ability to make payments to us 
the company s balance of non performing assets has been relatively high in years past due in large part to persistent agricultural difficulties 
furthermore  a sizable portion of our total loan portfolio consists of loans to borrowers either directly or indirectly involved in the agricultural industry 
while a great number of our borrowers may not be individually involved in agriculture  many of the jobs in the san joaquin valley are ancillary to the regular production  processing  marketing and sales of agricultural commodities 
the ripple effect of lower commodity prices for milk  nuts  olives  grapes  oranges and tree fruit has a tendency to depress land prices  lower borrower income  and decrease collateral values 
weather patterns in particular are of critical importance to row crop  tree fruit  and orange production 
a degenerative cycle of weather and commodity prices can impact consumer purchasing power  which has the potential to create further unemployment throughout the san joaquin valley 
global competition is another significant issue affecting the agricultural industry 
because of increased global competition and other factors  excess supply and low prices currently characterize the markets for many agricultural products 
if current agricultural conditions do not improve  our level of non performing assets could increase 
such conditions have affected and may continue to adversely affect our borrower base and  by extension  our business 
concentrations of real estate loans could subject us to increased risks in the event of a real estate recession or natural disaster 
our loan portfolio is heavily concentrated in real estate loans  particularly commercial real estate 
at december   of our loan portfolio consisted of loans secured by real estate 
between the end of and the end of  our loans secured by commercial professional office properties including construction and development loans increased from to of total loans  while loans secured by residential properties have decreased from to 
in the early s  the entire state of california experienced an economic recession that particularly impacted real estate values and resulted in increases in the level of delinquencies and losses for many financial institutions 
much of our market area seems to have been insulated from the significant fluctuations in real estate prices experienced by other parts of california over the past few decades 
however  if a similar real estate recession affects our market areas in the future  the collateral for many of our loans could be reduced in value and the ability of some of our borrowers to pay could decline 
similarly  the occurrence of a natural disaster like those california has experienced in the past  including earthquakes  brush fires  and flooding  could impair the value of the collateral we hold for real estate secured loans and negatively impact our results of operations 
we may have difficulty managing our growth 
management intends to leverage the company s current infrastructure to grow assets  and the addition of new branches has been tentatively planned  although no assurance can be given that this strategy will result in significant growth 
our ability to manage growth will depend primarily on our ability to monitor and manage expanded operations  control funding costs and operating expenses  maintain positive customer relations  and attract  assimilate and retain qualified personnel 
if we fail to achieve these objectives in an efficient and timely manner we may experience disruptions in our business plans  and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our earnings are subject to interest rate risk 
the earnings of most financial institutions depend largely on the relationship between the cost of funds  primarily deposits and borrowings  and the yield on earning assets such as loans and investment securities 
this relationship  known as the interest rate spread  is subject to fluctuation and is affected by economic  regulatory and competitive factors that influence interest rates  the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the level of non performing assets 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
fluctuations in interest rates affect the demand of customers for our products and services  and the company is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that our interest bearing liabilities re price or mature more slowly or more rapidly or on a different basis than our interest earning assets 
given the current volume  mix  and re pricing characteristics of the company s interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets  our interest rate 
table of contents spread should not change significantly if interest rates rise or fall 
however  there are scenarios where fluctuations in interest rates in either direction could have a negative effect on net income 
for example  if funding rates rise faster than asset yields in a rising rate environment ie  if basis compression occurs  or if we do not actively manage certain loan index rates in a declining rate environment  we would be negatively impacted 
we operate in a competitive market dominated by banks and other financial services providers  many of which have lower cost structures and offer more services 
in california generally  and in our primary service area specifically  branches of major banks dominate the commercial banking industry 
by virtue of their larger capital base  such institutions have substantially greater lending limits than we do  and perform certain functions for their customers  including trust services and international banking  which we are not equipped to offer directly but some of which we offer indirectly through correspondent relationships 
many of these banks also operate with economies of scale that result in lower operating costs relative to revenue generated 
we also compete with other financial institutions such as savings and loan associations  credit unions  thrift and loan companies  mortgage companies  securities brokerage companies and insurance companies  and with quasi financial institutions such as money market funds for deposits and loans 
financial services like ours are increasingly offered over the internet on a national and international basis  and we compete with providers of these services as well 
ultimately  competition can drive down our interest margins and reduce our profitability 
it can also make it more difficult for us to continue to increase the size of our loan and deposit portfolios 
you may have difficulty selling your shares in the future if a more active trading market for our stock does not develop 
although sierra bancorp s common stock has been listed on the nasdaq national market since august  the effective date of the holding company reorganization and bank of the sierra s common stock was previously listed on the nasdaq national market since june   trading in our stock has not been extensive and cannot be characterized as amounting to an active trading market 
we may experience loan and lease losses in excess of our allowance for loan and lease losses 
we are careful in our loan underwriting process in order to limit the risk that borrowers might fail to repay  nevertheless  losses can and do occur 
we create an allowance for estimated loan and lease losses in our accounting records  based on estimates of the following industry standards  historical experience with our loans  evaluation of economic conditions  regular reviews of the quality mix and size of the overall loan portfolio  regular reviews of delinquencies  and the quality of the collateral underlying our loans 
we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses at a level that we believe is adequate to absorb any specifically identified losses as well as any other losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
however  changes in economic  operating and other conditions  including changes in interest rates  that are beyond our control  may cause our actual loan losses to exceed our current allowance estimates 
if actual losses exceed the amount reserved  it will have a negative impact on our profitability 
in addition  the fdic and the dfi  as part of their supervisory functions  periodically review our allowance for loan and lease losses 
such agencies may require us to increase our provision for loan and lease losses or to recognize further losses  based on their judgments  which may be different from those of our management 
any increase in the allowance required by the fdic or the dfi could also hurt our business 
our directors and executive officers control a near majority of our stock  and your interests may not always be the same as those of the board and management 
as of december   our directors and executive officers  together with their affiliates  beneficially owned approximately of the bank s outstanding voting stock including vested option shares 
as a result  if all of these shareholders were to take a common position  they could most likely control the outcome of most corporate actions  such as approval of mergers or other business combinations  
table of contents sales of all or substantially all of our assets  any matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders  issuance of any additional common stock or other equity securities  incurrence of debt other than in the ordinary course of business  the selection and tenure of our chief executive officer  and payment of dividends on common stock or other equity securities 
in some situations  the interests of our directors and executive officers may be different from yours 
however  our board of directors and executive officers have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the shareholders  rather than in their own best interests  when considering a proposed business combination or any of these types of matters 
provisions in our articles of incorporation will delay or prevent changes in control of our corporation or our management 
these provisions make it more difficult for another company to acquire us  which could reduce the market price of our common stock and the price that you receive if you sell your shares in the future 
these provisions include the following staggered terms of office for members of the board of directors  the elimination of cumulative voting in the election of directors  and a requirement that our board of directors consider the potential social and economic effects on our employees  depositors  customers and the communities we serve as well as certain other factors  when evaluating a possible tender offer  merger or other acquisition of the company 
item properties the company s administrative headquarters is located at north main street  porterville  california  and is leased through april from parties unrelated to the company 
it consists of approximately  square feet in a three story building of which the company is sole occupant  and the rent as of december  was  per month 
the company also owns unencumbered property on which of its current branches are located  including the branches in porterville  lindsay  exeter  three rivers  dinuba  tulare  hanford  tehachapi  and california city 
one of the fresno branches is owned while the other is leased from unrelated parties  as is the case in bakersfield 
both visalia branches and the clovis branch are leased from unrelated parties 
in addition  the company operates a technology center in porterville which consists of approximately  square feet in a freestanding single story building that is leased from unrelated parties 
the bank has six remote atm locations leased from unrelated parties  although the amount of monthly rent at these locations is minimal 
management believes that the company s existing back office facilities are adequate to accommodate the company s operations for the immediately foreseeable future  although limited branch expansion is planned 
item legal proceedings from time to time  the company is a party to claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
after taking into consideration information furnished by counsel to the company as to the current status of these claims or proceedings to which the company is a party  management is of the opinion that the ultimate aggregate liability represented thereby  if any  will not have a material adverse affect on the financial condition of the company

shareholders of record at the company s stock transfer agent totaled  while street name holders totaled about  c dividends as a bank holding company that currently has no significant assets other than its equity interest in the bank  the company s ability to declare dividends depends primarily upon dividends it receives from the bank 
the bank s dividend practices in turn depend upon legal restrictions  the bank s earnings  financial position  current and anticipated capital requirements  and other factors deemed relevant by the bank s board of directors at that time 
the company paid cash dividends totaling million  or per share in  and million or per share in  representing and  respectively  of the prior year s earnings 
the company s general dividend policy is to pay cash dividends at approximate peer levels  provided that such payments do not adversely affect the company s financial condition and are not overly restrictive to its growth capacity 
however  no assurance can be given that earnings and or growth expectations in any given year will justify the payment of such a dividend 
during any period in which the company has deferred payment of interest otherwise due and payable on its subordinated debt securities  it may not make any dividends or distributions with respect to its capital stock see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources 

table of contents the power of the bank s board of directors to declare cash dividends is also subject to statutory and regulatory restrictions which limit the amount available for cash dividends depending upon the earnings  financial condition and cash needs of the bank  as well as general business conditions 
under california banking law  the bank may declare dividends in an amount not exceeding the lesser of its retained earnings or its net income for the last three years reduced by dividends paid during such period or  with the prior approval of the california commissioner of financial institutions  in an amount not exceeding the greatest of i the retained earnings of the bank  ii the net income of the bank for its last fiscal year  or iii the net income of the bank for its current fiscal year 
the payment of any cash dividends by the bank will depend not only upon the bank s earnings during a specified period  but also on the bank meeting certain regulatory capital requirements 
the company s ability to pay dividends is also limited by state corporation law 
the california general corporation law prohibits the company from paying dividends on the common stock unless i its retained earnings  immediately prior to the dividend payment  equals or exceeds the amount of the dividend or ii immediately after giving effect to the dividend the sum of the company s assets exclusive of goodwill and deferred charges would be at least equal to of its liabilities not including deferred taxes  deferred income and other deferred liabilities and the current assets of the company would be at least equal to its current liabilities  or  if the average of its earnings before taxes on income and before interest expense for the two preceding fiscal years was less than the average of its interest expense for the two preceding fiscal years  at least equal to of its current liabilities

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion presents management s analysis of the financial condition of the company as of december  and december   and the results of operations for each of the years in the three year period ended december  the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the notes related thereto presented elsewhere in this form k annual report see item below 
statements contained in this report or incorporated by reference that are not purely historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of as amended  including the company s expectations  intentions  beliefs  or strategies regarding the future 
all forward looking statements concerning economic conditions  growth rates  income  expenses  or other values as may be included in this document are based on information available to the company on the date noted  and the company assumes no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
it is important to note that the company s actual results could materially differ from those in such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward looking statements include but are not limited to fluctuations in interest rates  inflation  government regulations  economic conditions  customer disintermediation and competitive product and pricing pressures in the geographic and business areas in which the company conducts its operations 
critical accounting policies the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the financial information contained within these statements is  to a significant extent  based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
critical accounting policies are those that involve the most complex and subjective decisions and assessments  and have the greatest potential impact on the company s stated results of operations 
in management s opinion  the company s critical accounting policies deal with the following areas the establishment of the company s allowance for loan losses  as explained in detail in the provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses sections of this discussion and analysis  loan origination costs  which are estimated in aggregate by loan type based on an annual evaluation of expenses primarily salaries and benefits associated with successful loan originations and are allocated to individual loans as they are booked  but can actually vary significantly for individual loans depending on the characteristics of such loans  estimated residual values on leases  which have the potential to vary significantly from actual market values at lease termination  and depreciation expense  especially on technology equipment due to the potential impact of unexpected changes in the useful life of such equipment 
summary of performance the company achieved record earnings in in fact  net income has increased in of the last years 
net income in was million  an increase of almost million  or  over the million in net earnings recognized in net income in was million higher than net earnings of million 
net income per basic share was for  as compared to during and in the company s return on average assets was and return on average equity was in  as compared to and  respectively in  and and  respectively for the most significant single event impacting the company s results of operations and financial condition in was the implementation of a leverage strategy 
this involved the purchase of over million in mortgage backed securities that are guaranteed by agencies of the federal government  with the bulk of the purchase occurring on april  the purchase was financed primarily with collateralized borrowings from the federal home loan bank fhlb  with original maturities ranging from overnight to five years 
the leverage transaction also included the purchase of more than million in fhlb stock  a dividend yielding investment that was necessary to facilitate the increased level of borrowings from that institution 
based on the expected average life of the mortgage backed securities  we anticipate the return of the majority of invested principal within five years and thus effectively view this as a five year strategy 

table of contents the net interest margin for this transaction averaged an annualized basis points during  although it fluctuates with variances in the amortization of purchase premiums caused by changes in the level of prepayments on the mortgage backed securities 
net interest income generated by the transaction in was million  which boosted the company s return on average equity by almost basis points 
because of the addition of a significant level of assets  however  return on average assets for was approximately basis points lower than it otherwise would have been 
projected cash flows on the asset and liability sides of the leverage transaction have been matched as closely as possible  however the principal on the mortgage backed securities could prepay either slower or faster than expected 
this introduces a certain level of interest rate risk into the transaction 
while no assurance can be given that any specific level of income will be maintained  management evaluated potential risks and rewards and concluded that it was in the best interest of the company to implement this strategy 
it is possible that should interest rate conditions be conducive to a similar undertaking in the future  the company could purchase additional securities as the balance invested under the current strategy declines 
the following are other noteworthy factors relevant to the company s results of operations for the most recent three years net interest income was a major contributor to the increase in net income in net interest income grew by million  or  in relative to average investment balances grew by million  or  primarily due to the leverage strategy  and net of funding costs added million to net interest income as noted above 
however  it should not be overlooked that average loan and lease balances increased by million  or  which increase was funded primarily by corresponding growth in non interest bearing and low cost deposits and thus contributed approximately million to net interest income in in the largest gain was also in net interest income  which resulted from million growth in average earning assets and a basis point improvement in the company s net interest margin 
the net interest margin increased in mainly because of relatively strong growth in average core deposits 
non interest income declined by in  because of a lackluster increase in deposit service charges  a drop in referral fees on mortgage loans due to declining activity  a decline in income from bank owned life insurance boli  and lower investment gains 
the decrease in boli income was due to a fourth quarter adjustment related to potential surrender charges  and a lower overall earnings credit rate 
in  non interest income increased by million  or  due mainly to higher service charges related to an increase in demand deposit accounts and an increase in boli income 
the bulk of the company s boli investments were made in september and october of non interest expenses were limited to a increase in  despite the addition of a branch and various technology upgrades during the year 
this is mainly because salaries and employee benefits  the largest component of non interest expense  increased by only  or  due to a million increase in salaries deferred pursuant to fas in  non interest expenses were held to an increase despite increases of almost in salaries and employee benefits  and occupancy and fixed asset expenses 
those increases  which were in part the result of a conversion to in house item processing in september of and the addition of a branch in  were partially offset by savings from the elimination of outsourced item processing costs in the provision for loan losses was  higher in than in the provision increased for the year despite lower loan charge offs and a significant drop in non performing assets  mainly due to loan growth and additional economic considerations  including the recent relatively rapid increase in real estate prices 
the provision was  lower in than in despite significant growth in the company s loan portfolio  because most of the growth was comprised of loans secured by real estate which have a lower historical loss factor and due to the fact that net loan charge offs were lower in than in 
table of contents for the second year in a row the provision for income taxes experienced a disproportionate increase  again as the result of issues related to the company s real estate investment trust reit 
in the company added  to its regular tax provision  due to a payment necessitated by the removal of reit benefits from amended income tax returns filed in the first quarter of the increase in the tax accrual rate in came from the company s decision in the fourth quarter of to reverse all tax benefits derived during the year from the company s reit 
the following are important factors in understanding our financial condition and liquidity  which remain strong total assets grew by million  or  to million at the end of from million at the end of as previously discussed  much of the increase came in investment securities  which were million higher due mostly to the leverage strategy 
gross loan and lease balances increased by million  mainly from growth in loans secured by commercial properties and home equity lines secured by residential properties 
the majority of the net increase in loan balances was organic growth in markets located within the company s geographic footprint 
cash and due from banks was million lower at december  than at december   primarily due to timing differences in the collection of cash items 
the annual average balance of cash and due from banks was million in relative to million in other assets increased by million  or  due mainly to an additional investment in fhlb stock  an increase in low income housing tax credit fund investments  and an increase in prepaid income taxes 
the composition of deposits continued to shift in a positive manner during  with non interest bearing deposits growing by close to million and climbing to of total deposits at the end of from at the end of interest bearing core deposits increased by million  or  despite historically low interest rates 
core deposits  defined as all deposits except brokered deposits and time deposits in denominations over  experienced strong growth as the result of focused marketing and improved cross selling efforts 
non deposit borrowings  including junior subordinated debentures  increased from to of total liabilities 
most of this increase is directly attributable to fhlb borrowings obtained pursuant to the leverage strategy  however the increase in subordinated debentures was due to the company s issuance of an additional million in trust preferred securities in the first quarter of total shareholders equity increased to million at december  from million at december   due primarily to the retention of earnings less dividends paid 
the company s total risk based capital ratio at december  was 
results of operations the company earns income from two primary sources 
the first is net interest income  which is interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
the second is non interest income  which primarily consists of customer service charges and fees but also comes from non customer sources such as loan sales  bank owned life insurance  and gains on sales from the company s investment portfolio 
the majority of the company s non interest expenses are operating costs that relate to providing a full range of banking services to our customers 

table of contents net interest income and net interest margin net interest income was million in  compared to million in and million in this represents an increase of in over  and an increase of in over the level of net interest income depends on several factors in combination  including growth in earning assets  yields on earning assets  the cost of interest bearing liabilities  the relative volume of total earning assets and total interest bearing liabilities  and the mix of products which comprise the company s earning assets  deposits  and other interest bearing liabilities 
the following volume and rate variances table sets forth the dollar difference in interest earned and paid for each major category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for the noted periods  and the amount of such change attributable to changes in average balances volume or changes in average interest rates 
volume variances are equal to the increase or decrease in the average balance times the prior period rate  and rate variances are equal to the increase or decrease in the average rate times the current period average balance 
variances attributable to both volume and rate changes and the variance created by the additional day in a leap year have been allocated to the change in rate

as shown in the table  volume variances in relative to contributed million to net interest income  while unfavorable changes in interest rates offset the favorable volume variance by  for a net increase of million in net interest income 
the positive volume variance is mainly due to growth in average earning assets  but the volume variance is also impacted by fluctuations in the relative levels of non earning assets including cash and due from banks and non interest liabilities including demand deposits 
average non earning assets fell to of average total assets in from in the previous year 
the average balance of demand deposits  shareholders equity and other liabilities kept pace with growth in average assets  and was at of total average assets for both and the reduction in the relative level of non earning assets contributed to the company s profitability in note that the volume increase in earning assets added million to interest income  while the volume increase in interest bearing liabilities added only million to interest expense 
the impact of the leverage strategy can be seen in taxable investments on the asset side  and short term and long term borrowings on the liability side 
it contributed to the positive volume variance  but had a negative impact on the rate variance 
without the leverage strategy the net rate variance would have been positive  since rate variances caused loan income to decline by only  but contributed to a million drop in interest expense paid on deposits 

table of contents the following distribution  rate and yield table shows  for each of the past three years  the annual average balance for each principal balance sheet category  and the amount of interest income or interest expense associated with that category 
this table also shows the yields earned on each component of the company s investment and loan portfolio  the average rates paid on each segment of the company s interest bearing liabilities  and the company s net interest margin

loans are gross of the allowance for possible loan losses  deferred fees and related direct cost 
d represents net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
e non accrual loans have been included in total loans for purposes of total earning assets 
a substantial portion of the company s earning assets are variable rate loans that re price immediately when the company s prime lending rate is changed  versus a large base of core deposits that are generally slower to re price 
this timing difference causes the company to be slightly asset sensitive  which means that all else being equal  the 
table of contents company s net interest margin will be lower during periods when short term interest rates are falling and higher when rates are rising 
in  as market interest rates were generally increasing  the company s net interest margin would have increased by approximately basis points to if not for the impact of the leverage strategy 
in  shorter term interest rates continued their declining trend of the previous two years  however the establishment of informal floors on certain variable loan rates minimized the impact of falling rates on net interest income 
the converse of this hedge for declining rates is that net interest income did not increase as rapidly as it might otherwise have done as rates inched up during in  floors on loan rates and aggressive reductions in the pricing of deposit products resulted in a fairly consistent net interest margin 
in  the company s average loan portfolio grew by million  or  with earnings on that growth  net of associated funding costs  providing a considerable contribution to net interest income 
with the implementation of the leverage strategy  however  loan balances  which are the highest yielding component of the company s earning assets  have become a smaller percentage of the company s average asset base  declining to of assets in from in conversely  average investment balances have increased relative to total assets  to in from in a positive impact on the company s net interest margin in resulted from relatively large increases in the average balance of non interest demand deposits and low interest savings deposits  which together increased to of average total deposits from in enhanced cross selling efforts and marketing campaigns targeting checking accounts were in effect during much of the year  which contributed to the increase in demand deposit balances in because of the leverage strategy and the issuance of additional trust preferred securities  however  relatively higher cost borrowed funds increased to of total average assets in from in in and there was a favorable shift in the mix of both the company s deposits and other interest bearing liabilities  which helped boost the company s net interest margin in those years 
management anticipates that the company s current net interest margin will not vary significantly under any likely interest rate scenario  and net interest income will continue to increase if loans grow as planned and the loan growth is funded by reasonably priced deposits 
however  no assurance can be given that this will  in fact  occur 
provision for loan and lease losses credit risk is inherent in the business of making loans 
the company sets aside an allowance or reserve for loan and lease losses through charges to earnings  which are shown in the income statement as the provision for loan and lease losses 
specifically identifiable and quantifiable losses are immediately charged off against the allowance 
the loan and lease loss provision is determined by conducting a monthly evaluation of the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan and lease losses  and charging the shortfall  if any  to the current month s expense 
this has the effect of creating variability in the amount and frequency of charges to the company s earnings 
the procedures for monitoring the adequacy of the allowance  as well as detailed information concerning the allowance itself  are included below under allowance for loan and lease losses 
the company s provision for loan and lease losses was million in  million in  and million in in  the provision was  or  higher than in the previous year despite lower charge offs and a substantial reduction in non performing loan balances  due primarily to reserves provided for growth in outstanding loan balances 
because the provision exceeded net charge offs in  the allowance for loan losses increased by over million during the year 
subsequent to a thorough review of the allowance relative to the current size and composition of the company s loan and lease portfolio  this increase has been judged by management to be adequate to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level 
non interest income and non interest expense the company s results reflect a decline of  or  in non interest income for relative to  mainly because weak growth in service charges on deposits was not substantial enough to offset the aforementioned adverse 
table of contents adjustment to boli income 
non interest income was million in and million in  and declined to from of average earning assets 
non interest expense was million in versus million in  an increase of million  or 
however  for those same periods non interest expense declined as a percentage of average earning assets  falling to in from in because the increase in net interest plus other income in was proportionately greater than the increase in non interest expenses  the company s overhead efficiency ratio improved substantially 
the overhead efficiency ratio represents total non interest expense divided by the sum of net interest and non interest income 
the provision for loan and lease losses is not factored into the equation 
calculated on a tax equivalent basis  the company s overhead efficiency ratio was in as compared to in the following table sets forth the major components of the company s non interest income and non interest expense for the years indicated non interest income expense dollars in thousands  unaudited of total of total of total other operating income service charges on deposit accounts credit card fees other service charges  commissions fees boli income gains on sales of loans loan servicing income gains on sale of investment securities other total non interest income as a percentage of average earning assets other operating expenses salaries and employee benefits occupancy costs furniture equipment premises advertising and marketing costs data processing costs item processing costs other data processing deposit services costs loan services costs loan processing ore owned credit card other loan services other operating costs telephone data communications postage mail other professional services costs legal accounting other professional service stationery supply costs sundry tellers total non interest expense as a of average earning assets net non interest income as a of earning assets efficiency ratio tax equivalent 
table of contents the primary sources of non interest income for the company include the following service charges on deposit accounts  credit card fees  other service charges  commissions  and fees including atm fees  check card interchange fees  operating lease income  and other miscellaneous income  income from bank owned life insurance  gains on the sale of loans  and loan servicing income 
at times  the company has also realized substantial gains on the sale of investment securities and from the sale of loan servicing rights 
while it would appear on the surface that boli income has declined in significance relative to overall non interest income  this is mainly due to a fourth quarter adjustment that reduced boli income by  the income adjustment stems from certain boli accounts that had been carried on the company s books gross of potential surrender charges  but which were written down in to reflect such surrender charges 
while it has not been our intent to sell or otherwise liquidate those policies  and the surrender charges diminish over time and ultimately disappear  accounting guidance received in late indicated that all boli should be reflected on our balance sheet net of any potential surrender charges 
a lower average earnings rate on our aggregate boli investment during caused an additional  decline in boli income 
the decline in boli income makes other non interest categories appear to have strengthened their contribution to total non interest income  however for deposit service charges in particular growth has been virtually nonexistent 
despite fairly significant increases in average transaction account balances  and even though returned item and overdraft charges  a large component of deposit service charges  increased by  or  service charges on deposit accounts show little change in dollar volume and declined as a percentage of transaction accounts in relative to the company s ratio of service charge income to average transaction accounts demand and interest bearing now accounts was in as compared to in both and this phenomenon is due to growth in accounts that are initially free of service charges 
most financial institutions in the company s market areas have similar free account offerings  and management views this as a defensive product 
the negative service charge impact is overcome by the fact that they provide interest free funding  expand the company s customer base  and increase cross sell opportunities for other bank products such as consumer loans and relatively low cost savings accounts 
other service charges  commissions  and fees also constitute a large portion of non interest income  and totaled million in  million in  and million in the largest single increase within this category in was a  increase in leasing income  followed by atm fees and charges which were  higher 
the largest decline was a  drop in referral fees on mortgage loans  due to weakening mortgage loan activity 
income from loan sales was  in   in  and  in while the company still originates and sells a certain number of residential mortgage loans primarily those associated with its all in one construction through permanent financing product  in march of the company restructured its mortgage lending group to reduce expenses and began outsourcing the majority of its residential mortgage loan origination services to moneyline lending  inc this resulted in a drop off in loan sales income  although moneyline pays the company referral fees for successfully closed loans 
as noted above  moneyline fees are reflected in other service charges  commissions and fees 
with the sale of most of the company s loan servicing portfolio in  loan servicing income has become less significant and was only  in   in and  in gains from the sale of investment securities were negligible in the  gain on investment securities in is primarily comprised of liquidating dividends resulting from the company s investment in sphinx  as that company completed its planned dissolution 
sphinx was the shell company remaining after selling its primary earning asset  a core banking system known as phoenix which was the prior core system utilized by the company 
other gains from municipal bonds called in were offset by the company s write off of its  investment in california bankers insurance agency  subsequent to the receipt from them of correspondence alerting the company to their dissolution 
the  gain in was also largely due to liquidating dividends from sphinx 

table of contents the other category in non interest income includes  in non recurring gains from the sale of other real estate owned in  and approximately  in such gains in this category also includes rental income from investment centers of america  which is in the form of percentage rents based on gross commissions generated  and which did not increase significantly in typically  the largest dollar increase for any single non interest expense category is in salaries and employee benefits 
however  in this category increased by only  or  relative to this was in part the result of a million increase in salaries related directly to successful loan originations  which were deferred pursuant to fas and are subsequently being amortized as a reduction of yield over the life of the loans to which they relate 
excluding the impact of deferred loan origination costs  salaries increased by about  or  which represents a relatively modest increase in view of the branch addition and the enhancement of support staff in employee benefits increased by a disproportionate  or  in  primarily because of a  or  increase in group health insurance premiums  and a  or  increase in workers compensation costs 
in the cost of salaries and benefits increased by relative to the previous year due to regular annual increases of about  plus staff additions and higher benefits costs 
the increase includes staffing costs for the branch added in june  and reflects a full year of item processing personnel who came on board in august of furthermore  there were selective staff additions in our branches to boost business development activities  and back office staff additions to enhance customer service 
the increase in also includes an approximate  increase in accruals for salary continuation agreements  which were adopted for certain key employees in the fourth quarter of in conjunction with the company s purchase of boli 
as intended  however  boli income more than offset expense accruals for salary continuation agreements and the directors retirement plan 
expenses in were also impacted by the rising cost of benefits  with workers compensation premiums nearly doubling and group health insurance costs up substantially 
based on market analysis and peer comparisons  it is management s opinion that the company can achieve future growth in loans and deposits with staff additions limited to minimum requirements for new branches and nominal growth in support staff 
thus  it is expected that salaries and employee benefits will decline somewhat as a percentage of earning assets over the next few years  although there is no guaranty that this will actually occur 
the number of full time equivalent employees was at the end of  at the end of  and at the end of total rent and occupancy costs  including furniture and equipment expenses  were million in  million in  and million in the annual increase in these expenses was  or for  and  or for  and they rose to of total non interest expense in from in much of the increase in is the result of depreciation expense on equipment and software acquired in connection with the conversion of our core processing system at the beginning of an additional  of the increase is due to the charge off of obsolete telephone equipment subsequent to our conversion to voip technology in the fourth quarter of new branches also added over  to occupancy expense 
expenditures related to the physical security of premises and customer information  while difficult to quantify  also contributed to the increase in occupancy costs in approximately half of the increase in rent and occupancy expense is related to the inclusion of costs for a full year of the in house item processing operation  in the form of rent expense and depreciation on the equipment and tenant improvements  whereas in house item processing was only in operation for about one quarter of in late our data processing operations relocated to the same building utilized by item processing  further increasing rent expense 
the branch that commenced operations in fresno in june of was another factor in the increase in rent and occupancy expense for that year 
total data processing costs were almost the same in as in  however they dropped by million  or  in relative to the reduction in was due to the elimination of item processing outsourcing costs  which totaled million in other data processing costs offset this savings to some extent in  increasing by  or  due mainly to termination fees and other costs associated with the company s conversion of its core banking and online banking software which were expensed in 
table of contents deposit services costs increased by  or in  due to higher atm network and servicing costs  higher check printing costs  and higher courier costs 
in  however  deposit services costs fell by  or  primarily because of lower atm network costs 
loan services expenses were up by a combined  or  in  due mainly to higher oreo expenses and a  provision for unfunded commitments 
the cost of loan services declined in compared to because of more aggressive collection efforts for appraisal and inspection costs which are included in the loan processing subtotal 
despite additional consulting and audit expenses incurred in our efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act  other areas were well controlled and the total cost of professional services increased by only  in however  professional services expenses increased by  or  in while there were many contributing factors  the increase can primarily be explained by accruals for a retirement plan for directors that was adopted effective october  in conjunction with the purchase of boli 
the other operating costs category includes telecommunications  postage  and other miscellaneous costs  and totaled million in  million in  and million in telecommunications expense increased by  or  in  however with the recent technology upgrade near term expense increases are expected to be minimal  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
postage expense fell by  in due in part to postage for marketing pieces that is now included in advertising and marketing costs  while other operating expenses increased  primarily from a  increase in depreciation on operating leases and higher training costs 
other operating expenses for relative to include approximately  more in accruals for estimated operating losses on the company s investments in low income housing tax credit funds 
the losses are an expected component of these investments  and are factored into the initial assessment of projected returns 
while some level of expense increase is expected in the normal course of business  we are focused on controlling overhead expenses where possible 
improvement is evident in the company s tax equivalent overhead efficiency ratio  which dropped to in from in and for income taxes in the company s provision for federal and state income taxes was million  while the tax provision was million and million for and  respectively 
this represents of income before taxes in  in  and in the effective tax rate increased in relative to due to the suspended recognition of real estate investment trust reit tax benefits  and increased again in due in part to a  reit adjustment  as explained in greater detail later in this section 
without the adjustment in the rate would have been  which is still higher than in the previous year because most of the million increase in pre tax income in is taxable at the company s marginal tax rate of approximately 
the company did invest million in additional low income housing tax credit funds in mid  however the tax credits generated by that specific investment are minimal for the first year 
the company sets aside its provision for income taxes on a monthly basis 
as indicated in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the amount of such provision is determined by applying the company s statutory income tax rates to pre tax book income as adjusted for permanent differences between pre tax book income and actual taxable income 
these permanent differences include but are not limited to tax exempt interest income  increases in the cash surrender value of boli  california enterprise zone deductions  certain expenses that are not allowed as tax deductions  and tax credits 
tax exempt interest income is generated primarily by the company s investments in state  county and municipal bonds  which provided million in federal tax exempt income in and million in although not reflected in the investment portfolio  the company also has total investments of million in low income housing 
table of contents tax credit funds as of december  these investments have generated substantial tax credits for the past few years  with about  in credits available for the tax year and  in tax credits realized in the investments are expected to generate approximately million in aggregate tax credits from through  however the credits are dependent upon the occupancy level of the housing projects and income of the tenants and cannot be projected with complete certainty 
an additional permanent difference arose as a result of the formation of a reit which began operations in august the reit was formed to provide the company with greater flexibility in managing its capital  but had the added benefit of providing california income tax benefits 
the company adjusted its tax accrual effective august to allow for the year to date impact of the reit  and ultimately filed tax returns reflecting the reit benefit 
we continued to recognize this tax benefit through most of however  because of an adverse interpretation of existing law that was released by the california franchise tax board ftb on december   effective as of that date the company reversed all reit related tax benefits recognized during that year and suspended the recognition of those benefits going forward 
in addition  in the first quarter of the company filed amended income tax returns excluding the reit benefit and paid the additional tax and interest resulting from the revised calculation  which added approximately  to our regular tax provision 
california tax laws relating to reit s have not changed and our reit tax advisors a national accounting firm have affirmed their initial tax opinion  and challenges to the ftb s interpretation are now being asserted 
no assurance can be given that the tax benefits originally expected to be generated by the reit will ultimately be realized  however 
some items of income and expense are recognized in different years for tax purposes than when applying generally accepted accounting principles  leading to timing differences between the company s actual tax liability and the amount accrued for this liability based on book income 
these temporary differences comprise the deferred portion of the company s tax expense  which is accumulated on the company s books as a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability until such time as it reverses 
financial condition a comparison between the summary year end balance sheets for through was presented previously in the table of selected financial data see item above 
as indicated in that table  the company s total assets  loans  and shareholders equity have grown each year for the past four years 
the company experienced its most pronounced growth during  with total assets increasing by million  or  due to the aforementioned leverage strategy as well as strong organic loan growth 
the increase in assets was also substantial in  with growth of over million  or  due primarily to loan growth 
total assets were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the major components of the company s balance sheet are individually analyzed below  along with off balance sheet information 
loan and lease portfolio the company s loan and lease portfolio represents the single largest portion of invested assets  substantially greater than the investment portfolio or any other asset category  and the quality and diversification of the loan and lease portfolio are important considerations when reviewing the company s financial condition 
the company is not involved with chemicals or toxins that might have an adverse effect on the environment  thus its primary exposure to environmental legislation is through its lending activities 
the company s lending procedures include steps to identify and monitor this exposure to in an effort to avoid any related loss or liability 
at december   gross loans and leases represented of total assets  compared to and at december  and  respectively 
the decline in stems from a increase in investment balances relative to only a increase in loan balances due primarily to the implementation of the leverage strategy 
management expects that the company s ratio of loans and leases to assets will average around during  although the ratio also depends upon the relative growth of investments and non earning assets and could be higher or lower 
the ratio of net loans and leases to deposits increased to at the end of from at the end of 
table of contents overall demand for loans remains relatively strong in many areas within the company s markets and competition has intensified  especially in fresno and bakersfield 
to help ensure that we remain competitive  we have added leasing to our array of financing options  and make every effort to be flexible and creative in our approach to structuring loans 
more extensive loan oriented marketing has also been planned 
the selected financial data table in item above reflects the amount of loans and leases outstanding at december st for each year from through  net of deferred fees and origination costs and the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the loan and lease distribution table that follows sets forth the company s gross loans and leases outstanding and the percentage distribution in each category at the dates indicated 
the amounts shown in the table do not reflect any deferred loan fees or deferred origination costs  nor is the allowance deducted

participations purchased in roughly offset the runoff of participations previously purchased  however about million in net growth in was from commercial real estate loan participations purchased 
overall  loan demand in the company s immediate market has been weighted toward loans secured by real estate  including commercial and professional buildings and single family dwellings 
as a result  these areas have comprised the major portion of the company s loan growth over the past few years 
the most significant shift in the loan portfolio mix over the past five years has been toward real estate loans secured by commercial properties  which increased to of total loans at the end of from at the end of commercial real estate is an important part of the company s lending focus and is likely to remain so for the immediate future 

table of contents despite an overall trend upward for the past few years  commercial real estate loans fell slightly as a percentage of total loans during while loans secured by residential properties increased to from 
this was due mainly to the recent success of the company s home equity lines rather than growth in residential mortgage loans  as mortgage loan balances have tapered off subsequent to the outsourcing of most mortgage lending activity in commencing in march  the company began collecting referral fees for directing most of its residential mortgage customers to moneyline 
from march through december  the company referred a total of million in successfully completed mortgage loans to moneyline  with the volume of referrals increasing to million in with the recent slowdown in refinance activity  total mortgage loan referrals for were just million 
loans secured by farmland increased by million  or  in  which boosted those loans to of total loans at the end of from at the end of the company also originates and sells agricultural mortgage loans to certain investors  and the volume of agricultural mortgage loans serviced totaled million as of december  total loans serviced for others numbered with an aggregate balance of million as of the end of  as compared to loans with an aggregate balance of million at the end of and loans with an aggregate balance of million at december  commercial and industrial loans  including sba loans  increased by a combined million  or  in the company s commercial loans are centered in locally oriented commercial activities in markets where the company has a physical presence  and this segment of the portfolio has struggled for growth as the local market has become increasingly competitive and other lenders have been willing to offer terms that do not fit our profit equation 
potential business has been passed over in some instances  and in others the company has taken real estate collateral as an abundance of caution which causes the loans to be classified as commercial real estate 
the company also has a business unit dedicated to its sba product and is very active in specific sba program lending 
further  the company is designated as an sba preferred lender  which allows greater flexibility to meet small business loan requests with a more timely credit approval process 
in the past the company has sold some of its sba loans  and while we still have the ability to do so  our intention for the immediate future is to retain the sba loans we originate 
the consumer loans category represented of total loans and leases outstanding at december   and at december  these balances consist primarily of automobile loans and unsecured lines of credit 
consumer loans increased by million  or  during  a growth rate slightly higher than for the aggregate portfolio 
the increase in came despite the migration of consumer credit to tax advantaged home equity lines  and was primarily the result of marketing campaigns targeting auto loans 
agricultural loans stood at of total loans at the end of  a slight decline relative to but a fairly substantial decline relative to the ratio shown for the end of the decline in the relative level of agricultural loans over the past few years has been due in part to reduced local plantings in response to foreign competition 
however  the company has also withdrawn from financing production lines  where year to year cash flow variations can impede the ability of borrowers to meet contractual repayment terms 
with uncertain commodity prices some of our borrowers have experienced declining equity in farming operations  and many are selling farm land for alternate uses such as housing and commercial development 
credit card loans represented just of total loans and leases outstanding at december   having declined from of total loans and leases at december  despite this decrease  the credit card segment of the company s loan product group remains an important part of the company s relationship oriented retail lending strategy

the maturity distribution is based on remaining scheduled principal payments that are due within three months  after three months but less than one year  after one but within five years  or after five years

off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  the company makes commitments to extend credit to its customers as long as there are no violations of any conditions established in contractual arrangements 
these commitments are obligations that represent a potential credit risk to the company  yet are not reflected in any form within the company s consolidated balance sheets 
total unused commitments to extend credit were million at december   as compared to million at december  net of credit card lines available which were million and million at december  and  unused commitments represented and of outstanding gross loans and leases at december  and  respectively 
the company s stand by letters of credit at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the effect on the company s revenues  expenses  cash flows and liquidity from the unused portion of the commitments to provide credit cannot be reasonably predicted  because there is no certainty that the lines of credit will ever be fully utilized

table of contents non performing assets financial institutions generally have a certain level of exposure to asset quality risk  and could potentially receive less than a full return of principal and interest if a debtor becomes unable or unwilling to repay 
since loans are the most significant assets of the company and generate the largest portion of its revenues  the company s management of asset quality risk is focused primarily on loan quality 
banks have generally suffered their most severe earnings declines as a result of customers inability to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debts  or as a result of the downturns in national and regional economies which have brought about declines in overall property values 
in addition  certain debt securities that the company may purchase have the potential of becoming less valuable if the obligor s financial capacity to repay deteriorates  and the company s equity investments could fall in value 
to help minimize credit quality concerns  we have established a sound approach to credit that includes well defined goals and objectives and well documented credit policies and procedures 
the policies and procedures identify market segments  set goals for portfolio growth or contraction  and establish limits on industry and geographic credit concentrations 
in addition  these policies establish the company s underwriting standards and the methods of monitoring ongoing credit quality 
the company s internal credit risk controls are centered in underwriting practices  credit granting procedures  training  risk management techniques  and familiarity with loan and lease customers as well as the relative diversity and geographic concentration of our loan and lease portfolio 
the company s credit risk may also be affected by external factors such as the level of interest rates  employment  general economic conditions  real estate values  and trends in particular industries or geographic markets 
as a multi community independent bank serving a specific geographic area  the company must contend with the unpredictable changes of the california and san joaquin valley markets 
the company s asset quality has suffered in the past from the impact of national and regional economic recessions  consumer bankruptcies  weather related agricultural losses  and depressed prices for agricultural goods 
recently  however  the san joaquin valley has experienced healthy commercial and residential growth even as the agricultural industry remains relatively weak 
major companies are discovering the san joaquin valley as an ideal location for distribution facilities  jobs are growing at a relatively fast rate  and comparatively low cost housing has attracted new residents from more expensive regions of california 
the company is optimistic that the local economy will continue to flourish  but no assurance can be given that this will in fact occur 
non performing assets are comprised of the following loans and leases for which the company is no longer accruing interest  loans and leases days or more past due and still accruing interest although they are generally placed on non accrual when they become days past due  loans and leases restructured where the terms of repayment have been renegotiated  resulting in a deferral of interest or principal  and other real estate owned oreo 
management s classification of a loan or lease as non accrual is an indication that there is reasonable doubt as to the full recovery of principal or interest on the loan or lease 
at that point  the company stops accruing income from the interest  reverses any uncollected interest that had been accrued but unpaid  and recognizes interest income only as cash interest payments are received and as long as the collection of all outstanding principal is not in doubt 
the loans may or may not be collateralized  and collection efforts are continuously pursued 
loans or leases may be restructured by management when a borrower has experienced some change in financial status causing an inability to meet the original repayment terms and where the company believes the borrower will eventually overcome those circumstances and make full restitution 
oreo consists of properties acquired by foreclosure or similar means that management intends to offer for sale 
the following table provides information with respect to components of the company s non performing assets at the dates indicated 

table of contents non performing assets dollars in thousands as of december  nonaccrual loans and leases agricultural commercial and industrial real estate secured by commercial professional office properties including construction and development secured by residential properties secured by farmland total real estate small business administration loans consumer loans credit cards subtotal loans and leases days or more past due still accruing as to principal or interest agricultural commercial and industrial real estate secured by commercial professional office properties including construction and development secured by residential properties secured by farmland total real estate small business administration loans consumer loans credit cards subtotal total non performing loans and leases other real estate owned total nonperforming assets restructured loans and leases n a n a n a n a n a nonperforming loans and leases as of total gross loans and leases nonperforming assets as a of total gross loans and leases and other real estate owned additional interest income of approximately  would have been recorded for the year ended december  if these loans had been paid in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the applicable period then ended or  if not outstanding throughout the applicable period then ended  since origination 
a restructured loan or lease is one where the terms were renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
total non performing balances stood at million at the end of  of which over million is agriculture related 
the non performing agriculture loans and oreo stem from issues in our agriculture credit department prior to its reorganization in at that time  an experienced agriculture lender manager was hired to monitor problems that were becoming apparent  implement tighter controls  and establish more effective underwriting criteria 

table of contents with that accomplished  we are now cautiously expanding the agricultural loan portfolio with loans to creditworthy borrowers  although no assurance can be given that all of those borrowers will continue to pay principal and interest in a timely manner 
the balance of non performing assets at the end of represents a decrease of million  or  from year end levels 
the ratio of non performing assets to total gross loans plus oreo also fell substantially  to at the end of from at the end of  and non performing loans as a percentage of total loans and leases fell to from 
while almost every category of non performing assets declined in  the main changes were in commercial and industrial loans  which dropped by million  agricultural loans  which fell by  and loans secured by farmland  which were  lower 
the decline in commercial and industrial loans was mainly due to a million relationship that was brought current when the customer collected delinquent payments owed to it under a government contract 
the company also collected a  balance plus past due interest under a usda guarantee  further reducing the balance of non accruing commercial loans 
the balance of agricultural loans and loans secured by farmland declined mainly due to principal pay downs  but also due in part to the charge off of balances deemed uncollectible 
a mitigating factor when evaluating the company s non performing loans is that million  or  of the total million balance at year end is secured by real estate 
an additional  or  is comprised of the guaranteed portion of loans that are backed by the us government 
we recognize that an increase in the dollar amount of non accrual loans and leases is possible in the normal course of business as we expand our lending activities  and we also expect occasional foreclosures as a last resort in the resolution of some problem credits 
at the end of january  we were advised by the borrowers on a million loan that they will be unable to comply with current repayment terms because of a dispute over payments due them under a government contract 
while the borrowers have been paying interest on the loan  they do not currently have the means to repay principal when due in april the company has been assured in writing that the borrowers intend to repay all principal and interest  and we hope to restructure the loan to better enable them to ultimately do so 
allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses is established through a provision for losses based on management s evaluation of known and inherent risks in the company s loan and lease portfolio 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged against current earnings  and reduced by net charge offs 
loans and leases are charged off when they are deemed to be uncollectible  while recoveries are generally recorded only when cash payments are received subsequent to the charge off 
we employ a systematic methodology for determining the allowance for loan and lease losses that includes a periodic review process and adjustment of the allowance at least quarterly 
our process includes a review of individual loans and leases that have been specifically identified as problems or have characteristics that could lead to impairment  as well as detailed reviews of other loans and leases either individually or in pools 
our methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations  both quantitative and qualitative  in establishing an allowance for losses that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date 
quantitative factors include our historical loss experience  delinquency and charge off trends  collateral values  changes in non performing loans and leases  and other factors 
quantitative factors also incorporate known information about individual loans and leases  including borrowers sensitivity to interest rate movements and to other quantifiable external factors  such as commodity price changes and acts of nature freezes  earthquakes  fires  etc  that occur in a particular period 
qualitative factors are at least to some extent based on management s judgment and experience 
they include an assessment of the general economic environment in our markets and  in particular  the state of agriculture and other key industries in the central san joaquin valley 
the way a particular loan or lease might be structured  the extent and nature of waivers of existing loan policies  the results of bank regulatory examinations  model imprecision  and the expected rate of portfolio growth are additional factors that are considered 
the table which follows summarizes the activity in the allowance for loan and lease losses for the years indicated

while uncollectible overdraft balances are now charged off as loan losses against the allowance for loan and lease losses  related overdraft fees and charges are still reflected as operating losses 
the allowance for loan and lease losses increased to of total loans and leases at year end from at the end of the allowance also increased as a percentage of non performing loans  growing to at the end of versus at the end of our methodology for determining the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan and lease losses is  and has been  consistently followed 
however  as we add new products  increase in complexity  and expand our geographic coverage  we expect to enhance our methodology to keep pace with the size and complexity of the loan and lease portfolio 
on an ongoing basis we engage outside firms to independently assess our methodology and perform independent credit reviews of our loan and lease portfolio 
the company s external auditors  the fdic  and the california department of financial institutions also review the allowance for loan and lease losses as an integral part of the examination processes 
management believes that the current methodology is appropriate given our size and level of complexity 
further  management believes that the allowance for loan and lease losses was adequate as of december  to cover known and inherent risks in the portfolio 
fluctuations in credit quality  changes in economic conditions  or other factors could induce us to augment the allowance  however  and no assurance can be given that such factors will not result in increased losses in the loan and lease portfolio in the future 
the following table provides a summary of the allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for specific categories at the dates indicated 
the allocation presented should not be interpreted as an indication that charges to the allowance for loan and lease losses will be incurred in these amounts or proportions  or that the portion of the allowance allocated to each category represents the total amounts available for charge offs that may occur within these categories

investment portfolio the investment securities portfolio had a book value of million at december   compared to million at the end of it is the second largest component of the company s interest earning assets  and the structure and composition of this portfolio is important to any analysis of the financial condition of the company 
the investment portfolio serves the following purposes it provides liquidity for loan balance increases or deposit balance decreases  it provides a source of pledged assets for securing certain deposits and borrowed funds  as may be required by law or by specific agreement with a depositor or lender  it provides a large base of assets  the maturity 
table of contents and interest rate characteristics of which can be changed more readily than the loan portfolio to better match changes in the deposit base and other funding sources of the company  it is an alternative interest earning use of funds when loan demand is weak  and it can enhance the company s tax position by providing partially tax exempt income 
the company uses two portfolio classifications for its investments held to maturity  and available for sale 
accounting rules also allow for a trading portfolio classification  but the company has no investments that would be classified as such 
the held to maturity portfolio can consist only of investments that the company has both the intent and ability to hold until maturity  to be sold only in the event of concerns with an issuer s credit worthiness  a change in tax law that eliminates their tax exempt status  or other infrequent situations as permitted by generally accepted accounting principles 
since the company does not have a trading portfolio  the available for sale portfolio is comprised of all securities not included as held to maturity 
even though management currently has the intent and the ability to hold the company s marketable investments to maturity  they are all currently classified as available for sale to allow flexibility with regard to the active management of the company s investment portfolio 
sfas requires available for sale securities to be marked to market on a periodic basis with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of equity 
monthly adjustments are made to that account to reflect changes in the market value of the company s available for sale securities 
the company s investment portfolio is currently composed primarily of us treasury and agency issues for liquidity and pledging  mortgage backed securities  which in many instances can also be used for pledging  and which generally enhance the yield of the portfolio  state  county and municipal obligations  which provide limited tax free income and pledging potential  and other equity investments 
the fourth category includes an equity investment in farmer mac stock  which is a required element to allow the company to sell certain agricultural loans to this quasi governmental agency 
securities pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements  public deposits and for other purposes as required or permitted by law were million and million at december  and  respectively  with the increase related to securities pledged for leverage strategy borrowings 
in  with the purchase of more than million for the leverage strategy  mortgage backed securities increased to of the total portfolio from at the end of us treasury and agency bonds declined to of the portfolio at the end of from at the end of  and municipal bonds fell to of the total portfolio at the end of from at the end of in reviewing actual balance changes  mortgage backed securities increased by million  while us government agency securities fell by million and municipal bonds were down by million in most of the decline in agencies was due to maturing bonds that were subsequently replaced with relatively higher yielding mortgage backed securities  while the drop in municipal securities was mainly from bonds that were called prior to maturity 
the company was not inclined to replace these with similar investments due to the relatively long duration and low yields of currently available bonds 
as can be seen on the distribution  rate yield table presented in a previous section  the average tax equivalent yield earned on total investments declined to in from in even though shorter term rates are trending upward  as higher yielding assets mature and are replaced by instruments with current market yields the portfolio yield is likely to continue to decline slightly 
the following investment portfolio table reflects the amortized cost and fair market values for the total portfolio for each of the categories of investments for the past three years

cash and due from banks cash on hand and balances due from correspondent banks totaled million at the end of and million at the end of at december   cash and due from banks comprised of total assets  compared to at december  these balances fluctuate frequently and by large amounts depending on the status of cash items in process of collection and cash on hand  thus period end balances are not optimal indicators of trends in cash and due from banks 
annual average balances provide a much more appropriate gauge 
the average balance for was million  an increase from the average of million for due mainly to the addition of a branch 
even with the new branches planned for  we expect that the average balance will decline slightly for the year due to more aggressive monitoring and management of branch cash levels  although no assurance can be provided that this will occur 
also  due from bank balances  including balances at the federal reserve bank  have generally been greater for the company than for similar size institutions in metropolitan areas where collection activity is more centralized 
however  as the electronic exchange of imaged cash items proliferates this geographic disadvantage could dissipate 

table of contents premises and equipment premises and equipment are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation is charged to income over the estimated useful lives of the assets and leasehold improvements are amortized over the terms of the related lease  or the estimated useful lives of the improvements  whichever is shorter 
depreciation and amortization included in occupancy and equipment expense was million for the year ended december  as compared to million during depreciation on equipment leased to others is reflected in other operating costs 
the following premises and equipment table reflects the balances by major category of fixed assets premises equipment dollars in thousands as of december  cost accumulated depr and amort net book value cost accumulated depr and amort net book value cost accumulated depr and amort net book value land buildings leasehold improvements construction in progress furniture and equipment equipment leased to others total the net book value of the company s premises and equipment increased by million in  due mainly to the new clovis branch  the additional software and equipment related to the conversion of the company s core processing system at the beginning of  the addition of a drive up teller and atm at the company s main office  and an increase in equipment leased to others 
the net book value of the company s aggregate premises and equipment was of total assets at december   at december   and at december  other assets other assets increased by million  or  during  and were about of total assets at the end of as compared to at the end of this relatively large increase is attributable to a million increase in prepaid income taxes overpayment in carried over to  a million increase in the company s investment in federal home loan bank fhlb stock  an additional million commitment to invest in low income housing tax credit funds  a  increase in accrued interest receivable  a  increase in the net cash surrender value of boli  and a  investment in sierra statutory trust ii relative to the issuance of trust preferred securities 
some of these items are discussed in greater detail below 
the company holds certain equity investments that are not readily marketable securities and thus are classified as other assets on the company s balance sheet 
these include investments in pacific coast bankers bancshares  diversified holding corporation dhc  california economic development lending initiative  and the fhlb 
the largest of these investments is the company s million investment in fhlb stock 
this investment fluctuates from time to time based on the company s borrowing activity at the federal home loan bank  and as noted earlier increased substantially in due to borrowings related to the leverage strategy 
currently  the only other significant investment in this category is the company s million investment in dhc that was made during dhc is owned primarily by a consortium of california bank holding companies  none of which holds voting shares in excess of of the total voting stock of dhc 
dhc is a holding company for certain title insurance companies which operate mainly in california and which derive a portion of their revenues out of referrals from the banks that own dhc 
dhc has experienced cash flow concerns during the past year  due to regulatory issues and a considerable slowdown in refinance activity 
a restructuring plan has been brought forward  however  involving a new investor who has substantial captive referral business  and after considerable discussion and evaluation management has concluded that this investment is not impaired 
low income housing tax credit funds lower the company s tax liability through direct tax credits as well as partnership operating losses 
pass through partnership losses from tax credit funds are charged against the company s investment in such funds  thus the investment has been written down from its original total of million 
table of contents to million at december  even taking losses into consideration and assuming no gain upon disposition  the estimated tax equivalent return on these investments over the expected year life is around  although no guarantee can be provided that this level of return will ultimately be realized 
as noted  the other assets category also includes an aggregate million investment in bank owned life insurance at december  boli is an insurance policy with a single premium paid at policy commencement 
its initial net cash surrender value is equivalent to the premium paid  and it adds income through non taxable increases in its cash surrender value  net of the cost of insurance  plus any death benefits ultimately received by the company 
the costs of certain benefit plans added by the company in are funded with boli income  but even net of the accruals for expected expenses associated with these benefit plans the boli is projected to have a tax equivalent return of around 
no assurance can be given that this return will be fully realized  though 
at december   a million net deferred tax asset is also an element of the company s other assets 
most of the company s temporary differences between book and taxable income and expenses involve recognizing more expense in its financial statements than it has been allowed to deduct for taxes  therefore the company s deferred tax assets typically exceeds its deferred tax liabilities 
the net deferred tax asset is primarily due to temporary book tax differences in the reported allowance for loan losses plus deferred compensation  net of deferred liabilities comprised mainly of fixed asset depreciation differences and deferred loan origination costs 
management has evaluated all deferred tax assets  and has no reason to believe that either the quality of the deferred tax assets or the company s future taxable income potential would preclude full realization of all amounts in future years 
deposits information concerning the average balance and average rates paid on deposits by deposit type for the past three fiscal years is contained in the distribution  rate  and yield table located in the previous section on results of operations net interest income and net interest margin 
the composition and cost of the company s deposit base are important components in analyzing the company s net interest margin and balance sheet liquidity characteristics  both of which are discussed in greater detail in other sections herein 
our net interest margin is improved to the extent that growth in deposits can be concentrated in historically lower cost deposits such as non interest bearing demand  now accounts  savings accounts and money market deposit accounts 
the company s liquidity is impacted by the volatility of deposits or other funding instruments  or in other words by the propensity of that money to leave the institution for rate related or other reasons 
potentially  the most volatile deposits in a financial institution are jumbo certificates of deposits  meaning time deposits with balances that equal or exceed  as customers with balances of that magnitude are typically more rate sensitive than customers with smaller balances 
the company s community oriented deposit gathering activities  however  seem to have engendered a base of local customers who tend to display more brand loyalty and thus are less likely to leave the company than might otherwise be expected 
the company s total deposits grew by million  or during  and by million  or during in  core deposits  which include all deposits except brokered deposits and time deposits issued in denominations of  or more  grew by a total of million  meaning that non core deposits actually dropped by million 
during  brokered deposits increased by million while core deposits increased by over million 
the average balance per core deposit account increased slightly  to  at the end of from  at the end of  however most of the increase in total balances was due to an increase in the number of accounts 
core deposit accounts increased by almost  in number in  an increase  and by about the same number in the increase in customers and accounts was generated by marketing campaigns specifically targeting retail deposit products  and by more intense cross selling efforts in the company s branches 
we are focused on sustaining the momentum in core customer deposit growth in order to let brokered deposits roll off as they mature  although no assurance can be given that the company will achieve this objective 
a favorable volume shift among deposits is particularly evident in non interest demand deposits  which increased to of total deposits at december  from at the end of december these deposits increased by million  or  in  and by million  or  in likewise  in regular savings accounts increased by million  or  and now accounts increased by million  or  both at a substantially higher rate of increase than the overall increase for total deposits 

table of contents the scheduled maturity distribution of the company s time deposits as of december  was as follows deposit maturity distribution dollars in thousands as of december  three months or less three to six months six to twelve months one to three years over three years total time certificates of deposits  other time deposits  total in addition to deposit liabilities obtained in local markets  the company provides a cash management product to its commercial business customers 
this product group is categorized as a non deposit sweep account  and the company s december  financial statements include million in repurchase agreements that represent such sweep accounts see short term borrowings table in the following section 
at december   the company s financial statements reflected approximately million in repurchase agreements  secured by pledged investments held segregated from the company s own securities portfolio 
due to their short term overnight nature  the cost of these sweep accounts has generally been lower than the company s interest rates for longer term funds 
it is anticipated that this product will remain an important aspect of the company s service capacity 
other borrowings the company utilizes other short term borrowings to temporarily fund loan growth when customer deposit growth has not kept pace with increases in outstanding loan balances 
in addition  short term borrowings may be used to purchase additional investments  or when additional liquidity is required to support higher customer cash utilization 
short term borrowings principally include overnight fed funds purchased  advances from the federal home loan bank of san francisco fhlb  and securities sold under repurchase agreements which were described more fully in the previous section 
the details of these borrowings for the years   and are presented below short term borrowings repurchase agreements dollars in thousands balance at december average amount outstanding maximum amount outstanding at any month end average interest rate for the year fed funds purchased dollars in thousands balance at december average amount outstanding maximum amount outstanding at any month end average interest rate for the year short term borrowings dollars in thousands balance at december average amount outstanding maximum amount outstanding at any month end average interest rate for the year 
table of contents the million in long term borrowings reflected on the company s balance sheet at december  represents secured advances from the fhlb pursuant to the leverage strategy 
original maturities on these borrowings range from one year up to five years 
capital resources at december   the company had total shareholders equity of million  comprised of million in common stock  million in retained earnings  and  in accumulated other comprehensive income 
total shareholders equity at the end of was million 
net income has provided million in capital over the last three years  of which million or approximately was distributed in dividends 
while the retention of earnings has been the company s main source of capital since  the company has also issued a total of million in trust preferred securities through its unconsolidated wholly owned subsidiaries  sierra capital trust i and sierra statutory trust ii 
trust preferred proceeds are generally considered to be tier or tier capital for regulatory purposes but long term debt in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
however  no assurance can be given that trust preferred securities will continue to be treated as tier capital in the future 
the company paid cash dividends totaling million  or 
per share in  and million or 
per share in  representing of the prior year s earnings for and for the company anticipates paying future dividends of around to of the prior year s net earnings  however no assurance can be given that earnings and or growth expectations in any given year will justify the payment of such a dividend 
the company uses a variety of measures to evaluate capital adequacy 
management reviews various capital measurements on a monthly basis and takes appropriate action to ensure that such measurements are within established internal and external guidelines 
the external guidelines  which are issued by the federal reserve board and the fdic  establish a risk adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of assets and off balance sheet exposures 
there are two categories of capital under the federal reserve board and fdic guidelines tier and tier capital 
tier capital currently includes common shareholders equity and the proceeds from the issuance of trust preferred securities trust preferred securities are counted only up to a maximum of of tier capital  less goodwill and certain other deductions  notably the unrealized net gains or losses after tax adjustments on securities available for sale  which are carried at fair market value 
tier capital includes preferred stock and certain types of debt equity which the company does not hold  as well as the allowance for loan losses  subject to certain limitations 
for a more detailed definition  see item  business supervision and regulation capital adequacy requirements herein 
at december   the company had a total capital to risk weighted assets ratio of  a tier risk based capital ratio of  and a leverage ratio of 
these all show improvement relative to the previous year end ratios of total capital to risk weighted assets  a tier risk based capital ratio of  and a leverage ratio of 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements provides more detailed information concerning the company s capital amounts and ratios 
at december   the bank had a total risk based capital ratio of  a tier risk based capital ratio of  and a leverage capital ratio of 
as of the end of  both the company and the bank were considered to be well capitalized by regulatory standards 
we do not foresee any circumstances that would cause the either the company or the bank to be less than well capitalized  although no assurance can be given that this will not occur 
liquidity and market risk management liquidity liquidity refers to the company s ability to maintain cash flows sufficient to fund operations  and to meet obligations and other commitments in a timely and cost effective fashion 
at various times the company requires funds to meet short term cash requirements brought about by loan growth or deposit outflows  the purchase of assets  or liability repayments 
to manage liquidity needs properly  cash inflows must be timed to coincide with anticipated outflows  or sufficient liquidity resources must be available to meet varying demands 
the company manages liquidity in such 
table of contents a fashion as to be able to meet unexpected sudden changes in levels of its assets or deposit liabilities without maintaining excessive amounts of on balance sheet liquidity 
excess balance sheet liquidity can negatively impact the interest margin 
an integral part of the company s ability to manage its liquidity position appropriately is the company s large base of core deposits  which are generated by offering traditional banking services in the communities in its service area and which have  historically  been a very stable source of funds 
in addition to core deposits  the company has the ability to raise deposits through various deposit brokers if required for liquidity purposes 
the company s loan to deposit ratio increased to at the end of from at december   due to a loan growth rate that exceeded the rate of deposit growth 
while no assurance can be given that this will be the case  management anticipates that this number may decline as core deposit growth catches up to loan growth 
we also monitor the company s liquidity position and net non core funding dependence ratios  among others  with policy guidelines of above and below  respectively 
the liquidity position ratio is defined as net cash  short term investments  and marketable assets minus liabilities secured by investments or other marketable assets  divided by total deposits and short term liabilities minus liabilities secured by investments or other marketable assets 
this ratio was at the end of december  and at the end of december the net non core funding dependence ratio is simply non core liabilities less short term investments  divided by long term assets 
it was at december  and at december the unpledged portion of the company s investment portfolio is also an integral component of liquidity management due to the relative ease with which many bonds can be sold 
despite the fact that the vast majority of investment balances added during the year were pledged as security for associated funding  there were still million in unpledged marketable investments at the end of that could be sold for liquidity purposes if necessary  and million in pledged securities in excess of actual pledging requirements 
management is of the opinion that its investments and other potentially liquid assets  along with other standby funding sources it has arranged  are more than sufficient to meet the company s current and anticipated short term liquidity needs 
along with available investment balances  sources of balance sheet liquidity include million in cash and due from banks  million in the guaranteed portion of sba loans  and million in the net cash surrender value of boli 
standby funding sources include a formal secured borrowing line with the federal home loan bank that has availability of million based on the current level of pledged real estate assets  informal unsecured short term liquidity lines for overnight fed funds with certain correspondent banks totaling million  and a million secured line at the federal reserve discount window 
interest rate risk management market risk arises from changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the company s market risk exposure is primarily that of interest rate risk  and it has established policies and procedures to monitor and limit earnings and balance sheet exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company does not engage in the trading of financial instruments  nor does the company have exposure to currency exchange rates 
the principal objective of interest rate risk management often referred to as asset liability management is to manage the financial components of the company in a manner that will optimize the risk reward equation for earnings and capital in relation to changing interest rates 
to identify areas of potential exposure to rate changes  the company performs an earnings simulation analysis and a market value of portfolio equity calculation on a monthly basis 
this identifies more dynamic interest rate risk exposures than those apparent in standard re pricing gap analyses 
the company uses sendero modeling software for asset liability management in order to simulate the effects of potential interest rate changes on the company s net interest margin  and to calculate the estimated fair values of the company s financial instruments under different interest rate scenarios 
the program imports current balances  interest rates  maturity dates and repricing information for individual financial instruments  and incorporates assumptions on the characteristics of embedded options along with pricing and duration for new volumes to project 
table of contents the effects of a given interest rate change on the company s interest income and interest expense 
rate scenarios consisting of key rate and yield curve projections are run against the company s investment  loan  deposit and borrowed funds portfolios 
these rate projections can be shocked an immediate and parallel change in all base rates  up or down  ramped an incremental increase or decrease in rates over a specified time period  economic based on current trends and econometric models or stable unchanged from current actual levels 
the company typically uses seven standard interest rate scenarios in conducting its simulations  namely stable  upward shocks of  and basis points  and downward shocks of   and basis points 
the company s policy is to limit the projected change in the company s net interest income relative to the stable rate scenario for the next months to plus or minus based on a basis point bp shock  plus or minus based on a bp shock  and plus or minus based on a bp shock in interest rates 
as of december   the company had the following estimated net interest income sensitivity profile immediate change in rate bp bp bp bp bp bp change in net int 
inc in s change the above profile illustrates that if there were an immediate and sustained downward adjustment of basis points in interest rates and the company did nothing further with regard to the active management of its assets or liabilities  net interest income would likely decline by around million  or approximately  over the next twelve months 
by the same token  if there were an immediate increase of basis points in interest rates  the company s net interest income would likely increase by million  or  for the next twelve months 
according to these net interest income simulations the company is asset sensitive in the shorter term  which is supported by fact the company has  in the past  seen erosion in its interest margin as rates are declining while benefiting in a rising rate environment 
the changes in net interest income under rising and declining rate scenarios are typically expected to bear more of a linear relationship 
the exposure to declining rates appears disproportionate in these simulations  however  because most of the company s deposit rates are currently so close to a floor of zero 
as rates on interest bearing liabilities hit this floor the company s yields on earning assets continue to fall  creating significant compression in the company s net interest margin 
in rising rate scenarios the gain in net interest income is uneven because the company s prime rate is currently basis points higher that the wall street journal prime rate down from a basis point spread for much of 
we have assumed that as rates rise we will continue to gradually allow the company s prime rate to return to its normal parity with wall street journal prime  thus slightly depressing initial increases in net interest income 
while management does not expect current rates to fall significantly  the company would likely continue to limit movement in the bank of the sierra prime rate if they did 
since over million in variable rate loan balances are tied to that rate  when the bank of the sierra prime rate is floored the company s interest rate risk profile changes dramatically immediate change in rate bp bp bp bp bp bp change in net int 
inc in s change given these assumptions  the negative impact of floored deposit rates wouldn t be felt significantly unless rates fell by more basis points or more 

table of contents the economic value of the company s balance sheet will also vary under the different interest rate scenarios previously discussed 
the amount of change is dependent upon the characteristics of each class of financial instrument  including the stated interest rate relative to current market rates  the likelihood of prepayment  whether the rate is fixed or floating  the maturity date of the instrument  and the particular circumstances of the company s customers 
economic value simulations tend to change over time as the characteristics of the company s balance sheet evolve  and as interest rate and yield curve assumptions are updated 
the economic value of equity eve is calculated by subtracting the estimated fair value of liabilities from the estimated fair value of assets 
fair values for financial instruments are estimated by discounting projected cash flows principal and interest at estimated current replacement rates for each account type  while the fair value of non financial accounts is assumed to equal book value and does not vary with interest rate fluctuations 
the table below shows estimated changes in the company s eve under different interest rate scenarios relative to a base case of current interest rates  assuming changes in the bank of the sierra prime rate are restricted under declining rate scenarios immediate change in rate bp bp bp bp bp bp change in eve in s change the company s eve in rising rate scenarios starts out million below base case  due to the assumption that the bank of the sierra prime rate is not increased until it reaches parity with the wall street journal prime rate 
that difference increases as rates go higher  because of the high degree of value lost in fixed rate earning assets relative to the value increase in liabilities 
because eve captures longer term as well as shorter term cash flows  the value changes in eve seemingly contradict the month net interest income simulations above 
the discrepancy is presumably due to the fact that only of the company s time deposits have maturities of greater than one year 
in a rising rate scenario deposit costs are more stable for the first twelve months  but by the end of that time period million  or  of time deposits will have repriced at higher rates 
under declining rates  the presumed floor on the bank of the sierra prime effectively turns loans linked to that rate into fixed rate loans that increase in value as rates decline  however a floor of zero or slightly above zero for variable rate deposits and other liabilities partially offsets the value increase in earning assets
