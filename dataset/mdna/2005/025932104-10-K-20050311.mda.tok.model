general following is a discussion and analysis of the financial statements and other statistical data that management believes will enhance the understanding of afg s financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements beginning on page f overview financial condition afg is organized as a holding company with almost all of its operations being conducted by subsidiaries 
afg  however  has continuing cash needs for administrative expenses  the payment of principal and interest on borrowings  shareholder dividends  and taxes 
therefore  certain analyses are best done on a parent only basis while others are best done on a total enterprise basis 
in addition  since most of its businesses are financial in nature  afg does not prepare its consolidated financial statements using a current noncurrent format 
consequently  certain traditional ratios and financial analysis tests are not meaningful 
the following items highlight improvements in afg s financial condition during afg and gafri issued just over million in senior debentures in the first quarter of  and used approximately million of the proceeds to retire higher coupon debt due unconsolidated subsidiary trusts that  in turn  retired preferred securities 
in  afg and gafri replaced their existing bank credit lines with four year lines of million and million  respectively 
no amounts were borrowed under these facilities at december  afg received million in cash during the fourth quarter of from the issuance of million shares of common stock 
at december   afg parent had over million in cash and short term investments 
results of operations through the operations of its subsidiaries  afg is engaged primarily in property and casualty insurance and in the sale of retirement annuities and supplemental insurance and life products 
with the sale of infinity in  afg narrowed the focus of its property and casualty business to its specialized commercial products for businesses 
the property and casualty business is cyclical in nature with periods of high competition resulting in low premium rates  sometimes referred to as a soft market or downcycle followed by periods of reduced competition and higher premium rates  referred to as a hard market or upcycle 
the s were a soft market period  prices started to harden in and accelerated significantly following the terrorist attacks in rate increases moderated during the latter part of and continued that trend during as discussed in the following pages under results of operations  the profitability of afg s property and casualty business improved during the hard market despite the negative impact of adverse development on prior year claims and lower yields on newly invested funds 
afg s net earnings for were million per share 
included in net earnings were the following items  net of tax and minority interest net realized gain of million on the sale of provident financial group securities 
charge of million related to the settlement of environmental litigation 
underwriting losses of million from four hurricanes 
critical accounting policies significant accounting policies are summarized in note a to the financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that can have a significant effect on amounts reported in the financial statements 
as more information becomes known  these estimates and assumptions could change and thus impact amounts reported in the future 
management believes that the establishment of insurance reserves  especially asbestos and environmental related reserves  the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs  and the determination of other than temporary impairment on investments are the areas where the degree of judgment required to determine amounts recorded in the financial statements make the accounting policies critical 
see liquidity and capital resources investments for discussion of impairments on investments and liquid ity and capital resources uncertainties for a discussion of insurance reserves 
recoverability of deferred acquisition costs deferred acquisition costs dac related to annuities and universal life insurance products are amortized in relation to the present value of expected gross profits on the policies 
assumptions considered in determining expected gross profits involve significant judgment and include management s estimates of assumed interest rates and investment spreads  surrenders  annuitizations  renewal premiums and mortality 
should actual experience require management to change its assumptions regarding the emergence of future revenues and profits commonly referred to as unlocking  a charge or credit would be recorded to adjust dac to the level it would have been if the new assumptions had been used from the inception date of each policy 
liquidity and capital resources ratios afg s debt to total capital ratio at the parent holding company level was approximately at december   compared to at december  afg s ratio of earnings to fixed charges  including annuity benefits as a fixed charge  was excluding the provident gain for the year ended december  excluding annuity benefits  this ratio was excluding the provident gain for although the ratio excluding interest on annuities is not required or encouraged to be disclosed under securities and exchange commission rules  it is presented because interest credited to annuity policyholder accounts is not always considered a borrowing cost for an insurance company 
the naic s model law for risk based capital rbc applies to both life and property and casualty companies 
rbc formulas determine the amount of capital that an insurance company needs to ensure that it has an acceptable expectation of not becoming financially impaired 
at december   the capital ratios of all afg insurance companies substantially exceeded the rbc requirements 
the lowest capital ratio of any operating afg subsidiary was over times its authorized control level rbc 
sources of funds parent holding company liquidity management believes afg has sufficient resources to meet its liquidity requirements 
if funds generated from operations  including dividends and tax payments from subsidiaries  are insufficient to meet fixed charges in any period  afg would be required to utilize parent company cash million at december  or to generate cash through borrowings  sales of securities or other assets  or similar transactions 
in november  afg replaced its existing credit line with a million  four year credit facility 
no amounts have been borrowed under this credit facility through december  amounts borrowed bear interest at rates ranging from to over libor based on afg s credit rating 
this credit agreement provides ample liquidity and can be used to obtain funds for operating subsidiaries or  if necessary  for the parent company 
through public offerings in the fourth quarter of  afg sold million shares of common stock at an average price of per share  net of commissions and fees 
net proceeds from the sales of million will be used to support the growth of its subsidiaries 
in addition  afg s wholly owned subsidiary  american premier underwriters apu  sold an additional million previously issued and outstanding afg common shares 
these shares were held for the benefit of certain class m creditors of apu s predecessor  the penn central transportation company 
proceeds from that sale million were placed in escrow to be used to pay apu environmental claims related to its former railroad operations 
all debentures issued by afg and gafri are rated investment grade by three nationally recognized rating agencies 
in february  afg issued million in debentures due under a shelf registration statement and called for redemption million in trust preferred securities 
under a currently effective shelf registration statement  afg can issue up to an aggregate of million in additional equity or debt securities 
the shelf registration provides afg with greater flexibility to access the capital markets from time to time as market and other conditions permit 
for statutory accounting purposes  equity securities of non affiliates are generally carried at market value 
at december   afg s insurance companies owned publicly traded equity securities with a market value of million 
in addition  great american insurance company owns gafri common stock with a market value of million and a statutory carrying value of million 
decreases in market prices could adversely affect the insurance group s capital  potentially impacting the amount of dividends available or necessitating a capital contribution 
conversely  increases in market prices could have a favorable impact on the group s dividend paying capability 
under tax allocation agreements with afg  its owned us subsidiaries generally compute tax provisions as if filing separate returns based on book taxable income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the resulting provision or credit is currently payable to or receivable from afg 
subsidiary liquidity in august  gafri replaced its existing credit agreement with a million four year credit facility 
amounts borrowed bear interest at rates ranging from to over libor based on gafri s credit rating 
there were no amounts borrowed under this agreement at december  in addition  gafri can issue approximately million in additional equity or debt securities under a currently effective shelf registration 
the liquidity requirements of afg s insurance subsidiaries relate primarily to the liabilities associated with their products as well as operating costs and expenses  payments of dividends and taxes to afg and contributions of capital to their subsidiaries 
historically  cash flows from premiums and investment income have provided more than sufficient funds to meet these requirements without requiring a sale of investments or contributions from afg 
funds received in excess of cash requirements are generally invested in additional marketable securities 
in addition  the insurance subsidiaries generally hold a significant amount of highly liquid  short term investments 
the excess cash flow of afg s property and casualty group allows it to extend the duration of its investment portfolio somewhat beyond that of its claim reserves 
in january  national interstate corporation nic  a majority owned subsidiary that specializes in property and casualty insurance for the passenger transportation industry  issued  shares of its common stock in an initial public offering 
a portion of the million of net proceeds from this offering were used to repay nic s million promissory note to another afg subsidiary 
the remainder will be used for other general corporate purposes 
after the offering  afg owns approximately of nic 
in gafri s annuity business  where profitability is largely dependent on earning a spread between invested assets and annuity liabilities  the duration of investments is generally maintained close to that of liabilities 
in a rising interest rate environment  significant protection from withdrawals exists in the form of temporary and permanent surrender charges on gafri s annuity products 
with declining rates  gafri receives some protection from spread compression due to the ability to lower crediting rates  subject to guaranteed minimums 
afg believes its insurance subsidiaries maintain sufficient liquidity to pay claims and benefits and operating expenses  as well as meet commitments in the event of unforeseen events such as reserve deficiencies  inadequate premium rates or reinsurer insolvencies 
contractual obligations the following table shows an estimate based on historical patterns and expected trends of payments to be made for insurance reserve liabilities  as well as scheduled payments for major contractual obligations in millions 
within more than total one year years years years annuity  life  accident health liabilities a property and casualty unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses b long term debt payable to subsidiary trusts operating leases total a reserve projections for insurance liabilities include anticipated cash benefit payments only 
projections do not include any impact for future earnings or additional premiums 
b dollar amounts and time periods are estimates based on historical net payment patterns applied to the gross reserves and do not represent actual contractual obligations 
based on the same assumptions  afg projects reinsurance recoveries related to these reserves totaling billion as follows within year million  years million  years million  and thereafter million 
actual payments and their timing could differ significantly from these estimates 
the afg convertible debentures due in are included in the above table at the first put date 
afg has no material contractual purchase obligations or other long term liabilities at december  investments afg attempts to optimize investment income while building the value of its portfolio  placing emphasis upon long term performance 
approximately two thirds of afg s consolidated assets are invested in marketable securities 
afg s investment portfolio at december   contained billion in fixed maturities classified as available for sale and million in other stocks  all carried at market value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of shareholders equity on an after tax basis 
at december   afg had pretax net unrealized gains of million on fixed maturities and million on other stocks 
fixed income investment funds are generally invested in securities with intermediate term maturities with an objective of optimizing total return while allowing flexibility to react to changes in market conditions 
at december   the average life of afg s fixed maturities was about years 
approximately of the fixed maturities held by afg were rated investment grade credit rating of aaa to bbb by nationally recognized rating agencies at december  investment grade securities generally bear lower yields and lower degrees of risk than those that are unrated or noninvestment grade 
management believes that the high quality investment portfolio should generate a stable and predictable investment return 
investments in mortgage backed securities mbss represented approximately one fourth of afg s fixed maturities at december  mbss are subject to significant prepayment risk due to the fact that  in periods of declining interest rates  mortgages may be repaid more rapidly than scheduled as borrowers refinance higher rate mortgages to take advantage of lower rates 
due to the significant decline in the general level of interest rates in recent years  afg has experienced an increase in the level of prepayments on its mbss  these prepayments have not been reinvested at interest rates comparable to the rates earned on the prepaid mbss 
substantially all of afg s mbss are investment grade quality  with over rated aaa at december  summarized information for the unrealized gains and losses recorded in afg s balance sheet at december   is shown in the following table dollars in millions 
approximately million of available for sale fixed maturities and million of other stocks had no unrealized gains or losses at december  securities securities with with unrealized unrealized gains losses available for sale fixed maturities market value of securities amortized cost of securities gross unrealized gain loss market value as of amortized cost number of security positions number individually exceeding million gain or loss concentration of gains losses by type or industry exceeding of unrealized gas and electric services banks  savings and credit institutions mortgage backed securities state and municipal telephone communications us government and government agencies percentage rated investment grade other stocks market value of securities cost of securities gross unrealized gain loss market value as of cost number individually exceeding million gain or loss the table below sets forth the scheduled maturities of afg s available for sale fixed maturity securities at december   based on their market values 
asset backed securities and other securities with sinking funds are reported at average maturity 
actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain securities may be called or prepaid by the issuers 
securities securities with with unrealized unrealized maturity gains losses one year or less after one year through five years after five years through ten years after ten years mortgage backed securities afg realized aggregate losses of million during on million in sales of fixed maturity securities issues  issuers that had individual unrealized losses greater than  at december  market values of six of the securities increased an aggregate of million from year end to date of sale 
the market value of the remaining security decreased  from year end to the sale date 
although afg had the ability to continue holding these investments  its intent to hold them changed due primarily to deterioration in the issuers creditworthiness  decisions to lessen exposure to a particular credit or industry  or to modify asset allocation within the portfolio 
the table below dollars in millions summarizes the unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturity securities by dollar amount 
market aggregate aggregate value as market unrealized of cost value gain loss basis fixed maturities securities with unrealized gains exceeding  issues less than   issues securities with unrealized losses exceeding  issues less than  issues the following table summarizes dollars in millions the unrealized loss for all fixed maturity securities with unrealized losses by issuer quality and length of time those securities have been in an unrealized loss position 
market aggregate aggregate value as market unrealized of cost value gain loss basis fixed maturities with unrealized losses at december  investment grade with losses for one year or less issues greater than one year issues non investment grade with losses for one year or less issues greater than one year issues when a decline in the value of a specific investment is considered to be other than temporary  a provision for impairment is charged to earnings accounted for as a realized loss and the cost basis of that investment is reduced 
the determination of whether unrealized losses are other than temporary requires judgment based on subjective as well as objective factors 
factors considered and resources used by management include a 
whether the unrealized loss is credit driven or a result of changes in market interest rates  b 
the extent to which market value is less than cost basis  c 
historical operating  balance sheet and cash flow data contained in issuer sec filings  d

ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
based on its analysis of the factors enumerated above  management believes i afg will recover its cost basis in the securities with unrealized losses and ii that afg has the ability and intent to hold the securities until they mature or recover in value 
should either of these beliefs change with regard to a particular security  a charge for impairment would likely be required 
while it is not possible to accurately predict if or when a specific security will become impaired  charges for other than temporary impairment could be material to results of operations in a future period 
management believes it is not likely that future impairment charges will have a significant effect on afg s liquidity 
net realized gains losses on securities sold and charges for other than temporary impairment on securities held were as follows in millions net realized charges for gains on sales impairment other a total a includes adjustments to reflect the impact of realized gains and losses on the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and to carry derivatives at market 
higher impairment charges in reflect a rise in corporate defaults in the marketplace resulting from the weakened economy and other factors 
uncertainties as more fully explained in the following paragraphs  management believes that the areas posing the greatest risk of material loss are the adequacy of its insurance reserves and american premier s contingencies arising out of its former operations 
property and casualty insurance reserves the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae was as follows in millions december  specialty personal other lines including asbestos and environmental the liabilities for unpaid claims and for expenses of investigation and adjustment of unpaid claims are based upon a the accumulation of case estimates for losses reported prior to the close of the accounting periods on direct business written case reserves  b estimates received from ceding reinsurers and insurance pools and associations  c estimates of unreported losses including possible development on known claims based on past experience ibnr  d estimates based on experience of expense for investigating and adjusting claims  and e the current state of law and coverage litigation 
using these items as well as historical trends adjusted for changes in underwriting standards  policy provisions  product mix and other factors  management  including company actuaries  determines a single or point estimate which it records as its best estimate of the liabilities 
recorded amounts are analyzed and tested on a quarterly basis by company actuaries 
ranges of loss reserves are not developed by company actuaries 
estimating the liability for unpaid losses and lae is inherently judgmental and is influenced by factors which are subject to significant variation 
through the use of analytical reserve development techniques  management considers items such as the effect of inflation on medical  hospitalization  material  repair and replacement costs  general economic trends and the legal environment 
while current factors and reasonably likely changes in variable factors are considered in estimating the liability for unpaid losses  there is no method or system which can eliminate the risk of actual ultimate results differing from such estimates 
as shown in the reserve development table loss triangle on page  the original estimates of afg s liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses  net of reinsurance  over the past years have developed through december   to be deficient for seven years by as much as and redundant for three years by as much as excluding the effect of special charges for asbestos and environmental exposures 
the average of such redundancies and deficiencies has been slightly less than deficient 
management believes this development illustrates the variability in factors considered in estimating its insurance reserves 
quarterly reviews of unpaid loss and lae reserves are prepared using standard actuarial techniques 
these may include but may not be limited to case incurred development method  paid development method  bornhuetter ferguson method  and incremental paid lae to paid loss methods 
supplementary statistical information is reviewed to determine which methods are most appropriate to use or if adjustments are needed to particular methods 
such information includes open and closed claim counts average case reserves and average incurred on open claims closure rates and statistics related to closed and open claim percentages average closed claim severity ultimate claim severity reported loss ratios projected ultimate loss ratios loss payment patterns within each line  company actuaries review the results of individual tests  supplementary statistical information  and input from underwriting  operating and claim management  to select their point estimate of the ultimate liability 
this estimate may be one test  or a weighted average of several tests  or a judgmental selection as the actuaries determine is appropriate 
the actuarial review is performed each quarter as a test of the reasonableness of management s point estimate 
the level of detail in which data is analyzed varies among the different lines of business 
data is generally analyzed by major product or by coverage within product  using countrywide data  however  in some situations  data may be reviewed by state for a few large volume states 
appropriate segmentation of the data is determined based on data volume  data credibility  mix of business  and other actuarial considerations 
overall  company actuaries review over identified line components 
best estimates are selected based on test indications and judgment 
the following table shows in millions the breakdown of afg s property and casualty reserves between case reserves  ibnr reserves and lae reserves estimated amounts required to adjust  record and settle claims  other than the claim payments themselves 
december  gross loss reserves total case ibnr lae reserve statutory line of business other liability occurrence workers compensation other liability claims made commercial multiple peril commercial auto truck liability medical private passenger auto liability medical special property fire  allied lines  inland marine  earthquake other lines total statutory reserves adjustments for gaap loss reserve discounting reserves of foreign operations total adjustments for gaap total gaap reserves following is a discussion of certain variables affecting the estimation of the more significant lines of business asbestos and environmental liabilities are separately discussed below 
many other variables may also impact ultimate claim costs 
an important assumption underlying reserve estimates is that the cost trends implicitly built into development patterns will continue into the future 
to estimate the sensitivity of recorded reserves to an unexpected change in the trends  was added to the trend that is embedded in the factors used to determine the reserves for ultimate liabilities 
this unexpected change could arise from a variety of sources including a general increase in economic inflation  inflation from social programs  new medical technologies  or other factors such as those listed below in connection with our largest lines of business 
utilizing the effect of a change in cost trends enables changes greater than to be estimated by extrapolation 
each additional change in the cost trend would increase the effect on net earnings by an amount slightly about greater than the effect of the previous 
for example  if a change in cost trends would change net earnings by million  a change would change n et earnings by million 
the estimated cumulative impact that a one percent change would have on our net earnings is shown below in millions 
line of business other liability occurrence workers compensation other liability claims made commercial multi peril other liability occurrence this line of business consists of coverages protecting the insured against legal liability resulting from negligence  carelessness  or a failure to act causing property damage or personal injury to others 
some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for other liability occurrence include litigious climate unpredictability of judicial decisions regarding coverage issues magnitude of jury awards outside counsel costs timing of claims reporting the judicial climate in some states has had some effect on certain claims in recent years with more liberal coverage decisions  expanded concepts of liability and higher jury awards 
significant case reserve strengthening has occurred in several books of business within this line 
stronger case reserves will cause future development on known claims to be less than recent historical patterns 
also  for some business in run off  there have been significant changes in the procedures for managing outside counsel costs which should result in a reduction in future loss adjustment expenses compared to prior experience for this line of business 
workers compensation this line of business provides coverage to employees who may be injured in the course of employment 
some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for workers compensation include legislative actions and regulatory interpretations future medical cost inflation timing of claims reporting afg s workers compensation business is written primarily in california 
there have been significant reforms passed by the california state legislature in and in that will impact future settlement payments for claims outstanding 
the magnitude of these potential cost savings depends on the implementation and interpretation of the reforms throughout the california workers compensation system over the next several years 
in addition  afg s strengthening of case reserves during and should cause future development of known claims to be less than prior historical patterns 
other liability claims made this line of business consists mostly of directors and officers liability  and professional liability  mostly for lawyers 
some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for other liability claims made include litigious climate the economy variability of the stock prices the general state of the economy and the variability of the stock price of the insured can affect the frequency and severity of shareholder class action suits that trigger coverage under directors and officers liability policies 
this has caused some adverse development in the past and is judgmentally considered in reserving for this line of business 
commercial multi peril this line of business consists of two or more coverages protecting the insured from various property and liability risk exposures 
the commercial multi peril line of business includes coverage similar to other liability occurrence  so in general  variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for commercial multi peril include those mentioned above for other liability occurrence 
in addition  this line also includes reserves for a run off book of homebuilders business 
variables unique to estimating the liabilities for this coverage include changing legal regulatory interpretations of coverage statutes of limitations and statutes of repose in filing claims changes in policy forms and endorsements over the years  certain portions of the homebuilders business has experienced adverse interpretations of coverage  coupled with certain statutory changes relating to liability  that caused an increase in the emergence of claims from older years 
management believes that changes in policy forms and endorsements implemented in will reduce afg s exposure to such adverse interpretations 
recoverables from reinsurers afg is subject to credit risk with respect to its reinsurers  as reinsurance contracts do not relieve afg of its liability to policyholders 
to mitigate this risk  substantially all reinsurance is ceded to companies with investment grade or better s p ratings or is secured by funds withheld or other collateral 
in  afg recorded a loss of million to commute million of reinsurance recoverables with certain of its reinsurers who have experienced deteriorating financial condition 
in the first quarter of  afg completed an additional agreement to help further mitigate its exposure to such reinsurers 
afg has recorded reserves for doubtful collection of reinsurance recoverables on a case by case and overall basis 
these estimates are subject to significant judgment and may vary significantly depending upon the reinsurers continued willingness and ability to pay amounts due 
asbestos and environmental related a e reserves asbestos and environmental reserves consisted of the following in millions december  asbestos environmental other mass tort a e reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable reinsurance recoverable  net of allowance gross a e reserves asbestos reserves include claims asserting alleged injuries and damages from exposure to asbestos 
environmental reserves include claims relating to polluted waste sites 
other mass tort claims include alleged injuries and damages from exposure to lead  silica and various chemical substances  as well as other toxic hazards 
approximately one half of afg s asbestos reserves relate to policies written by afg subsidiaries 
claims from these policies generally are product oriented claims with only a limited amount of non product exposures  and are dominated by small to mid sized commercial entities that are mostly regional policyholders with few national target defendants 
the remainder is assumed reinsurance business that includes exposures for the periods to the asbestos and environmental assumed claims are ceded by various insurance companies under reinsurance treaties 
a majority of the individual assumed claims have exposures of less than  to afg 
asbestos losses assumed include some of the industry known manufacturers  distributors and installers 
pollution losses include industry known insured names and sites 
establishing reserves for a e claims relating to policies and participations in reinsurance treaties and former operations is subject to uncertainties that are significantly greater than those presented by other types of claims 
for this group of claims  traditional actuarial techniques that rely on historical loss development trends cannot be used and a meaningful range of loss cannot be estimated 
management makes its best estimate of these reserves based on prior ground up studies adjusted for payments and identifiable changes 
case reserves and expense reserves are established by the claims department as specific policies are identified 
in addition to the case reserves established for known claims  management establishes additional reserves for claims not yet known or reported and for possible development on known claims 
these additional reserves are management s best estimate based on its review of industry trends and other industry information about such claims  with due consideration to individual claim situations 
estimating ultimate liability for asbestos claims presents a unique and difficult challenge to the insurance industry due to  among other things  inconsistent court decisions  an increase in bankruptcy filings as a result of asbestos related liabilities  novel theories of coverage  and judicial interpretations that often expand theories of recovery and broaden the scope of coverage 
the casualty insurance industry is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues as the volume and severity of claims against asbestos defendants continue to increase 
emerging trends  such as those named below  could impact afg s reserves and payments there is a growing interest at the state and federal level to attempt to legislatively address asbestos liabilities and the manner in which asbestos claims are resolved 
these developments are fluid and could result in a comprehensive solution or piecemeal state by state solutions 
the manner by which bankruptcy courts are addressing asbestos liabilities is in flux 
claimants counsel continue to file claims based on emerging toxic exposures such as silica 
while management believes that afg s reserves for a e claims are a reasonable estimate of ultimate liability for such claims  actual results may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded due to the difficulty in predicting the number of future claims  the impact of recent bankruptcy filings  and unresolved issues such as whether coverage exists  whether policies are subject to aggregate limits on coverage  whether claims are to be allocated among triggered policies and implicated years  and whether claimants who exhibit no signs of illness will be successful in pursuing their claims 
a variation in loss cost trends  caused by any of the factors previously described  would change net income by approximately million 
from time to time  afg has engaged independent firms to work closely with its claims staff to study the a e reserves of its insurance company subsidiaries 
the most recent study was completed in the third quarter of and resulted in afg recording a pretax charge of million to increase its a e reserves 
management believes that current practice of the property and casualty insurance industry is to commission a comprehensive study every three or four years 
accordingly  absent legislative reforms which may alter the need for an independent review  management plans to conduct such a routine study during in february  great american insurance company entered into an agreement for the settlement of asbestos related coverage litigation under insurance polices issued during the s and s to bigelow liptak corporation and related companies  subsequently known as ap green industries  inc management believes that this settlement will enhance financial certainty and provides resolution to litigation that represents afg s largest known asbestos related claim and the only such claim that management believes to be material 
the settlement is for million great american has the option to pay in cash or over time with interest  all but million of which was covered by reserves established prior to september   and anticipated reinsurance recoverables for this matter 
as a result  afg recorded a million pretax charge million after tax in the fourth quarter of the agreement allows up to of the settlement to be paid in afg common stock 
the settlement has received the approval of the bankruptcy court supervising the reorganization of ap green 
it remains subject to the confirmation by the bankruptcy court of a plan of reorganization that includes an injunction prohibiting the assertion against great american of any present or future asbestos personal injury claims under policies issued to ap green and related companies 
no assurance can be made that a plan of reorganization will be confirmed  no payments are required until completion of the process 
if there is no plan confirmation  the outcome of this litigation will again be subject to the complexities and uncertainties associated with a chapter proceeding and asbestos coverage litigation 
afg tracks its a e claims by policyholder 
the following table shows  by type of claim  the number of policyholders that did not receive any payments in the calendar year separate from policyholders that did receive a payment 
policyholder counts represent policies written by afg subsidiaries and do not include assumed reinsurance 
the significant decline in policyholder counts in reflects the sale of transport insurance company 
number of policyholders with no payments asbestos environmental other mass tort number of policyholders with payments asbestos environmental other mass tort total amounts paid net of amounts received from reinsurers for asbestos  environmental and other mass tort claims  including loss adjustment expenses  were as follows in millions asbestos environmental other mass tort total contingencies related to american premier s former operations at december   american premier had liabilities aggregating million for various environmental and occupational injury and disease claims and other contingencies arising out of the railroad operations and certain manufacturing operations disposed of by american premier and its predecessor 
for information on the settlement of american premier s largest outstanding environmental exposure and a discussion of the uncertainties in determining american premier s ultimate liability for remediation costs at the remaining sites  see note o commitments and contingencies to the financial statements 
results of operations three years ended december  general the following table shows afg s net earnings and diluted earnings per share as stated in the statement of earnings as well as the after tax effect of other items included in these gaap measures that are listed below to assist investors in analyzing their impact on the trend in operating results in millions  except per share amounts net earnings after tax income expense items included in net earnings charges resulting from litigation settlements arbitration settlement special tax benefits net earnings losses from investee corporations realized investment gains losses discontinued operations cumulative effect of accounting changes diluted per share amounts net earnings charges resulting from litigation settlements arbitration settlement special tax benefits investee corporations realized investment gains losses discontinued operations cumulative effect of accounting changes in addition to the effects of items shown in the table above  net earnings increased in due primarily to improved property and casualty underwriting results and higher operating earnings in the annuity  supplemental insurance and life operations 
net earnings increased in as improved property and casualty underwriting results more than offset a decline in the fixed annuity operations 
property and casualty insurance underwriting following the disposal of substantially all of its personal insurance business in  afg revised its reporting of the specialty insurance business into the following components i property and transportation  which includes inland and ocean marine  agricultural related business and commercial automobile  ii specialty casualty  which includes executive and professional liability  umbrella and excess liability and excess and surplus  iii specialty financial  which includes fidelity and surety bonds and collateral protection  and iv california workers compensation 
the personal group wrote private passenger auto insurance and  to a lesser extent  homeowners insurance 
to understand the overall profitability of particular lines  the timing of claims payments and the related impact of investment income must be considered 
certain short tail lines of business primarily property coverages have quick loss payouts which reduce the time funds are held  thereby limiting investment income earned thereon 
on the other hand  long tail lines of business primarily liability coverages and workers compensation have payouts that are either structured over many years or take many years to settle  thereby significantly increasing investment income earned on related premiums received 
underwriting profitability is measured by the combined ratio which is a sum of the ratios of underwriting losses  loss adjustment expenses  underwriting expenses and policyholder dividends to premiums 
a combined ratio under is indicative of an underwriting profit 
the combined ratio does not reflect investment income  other income or federal income taxes 
while afg desires and seeks to earn an underwriting profit on all of its business  it is not always possible to do so 
as a result  afg attempts to expand in the most profitable areas and control growth or even reduce its involvement in the least profitable ones 
over the last several years  afg has been realigning its property and casualty business mix and focusing on rate adequacy in order to improve its operating profitability 
management has continued to direct capital in order to take advantage of certain specialty market opportunities 
management believes these actions have been successful and that the current mix of specialty businesses positions the company for solid growth and continuing improved profitability in the foreseeable future 
afg s combined ratio has been better than the industry average for eighteen of the last nineteen years and excluding afg s special a e charges  for all nineteen years 
management believes that afg s insurance operations have performed better than the industry as a result of product line diversification and stringent underwriting discipline 
premiums and combined ratios for afg s property and casualty insurance operations were as follows dollars in millions gross written premiums gaap specialty property and transportation specialty casualty specialty financial california workers compensation other total specialty personal a other net written premiums gaap specialty property and transportation specialty casualty specialty financial california workers compensation other total specialty personal a other combined ratios gaap specialty property and transportation specialty casualty specialty financial california workers compensation total specialty b personal a aggregate including discontinued lines b c a includes the operations of infinity through the sale date in mid february and the direct auto business through its sale at the end of april b includes points in for the effect of hurricane losses

gross and net written premiums increased and  respectively  for compared to primarily due to rate increases 
rate increases also led to an point combined ratio improvement compared to specialty financial gross written premiums increased for due to substantial volume growth in collateral protection products for financial institutions

this group s combined ratio deterioration of points is primarily a result of the decline in results related to the residual value products 
lower used car prices  dealer incentives on new cars and the volume of used cars available from expiring leases contributed to the deterioration in the residual value results 
california workers compensation gross and net written premiums grew and  respectively  in compared to  reflecting significant volume growth

annuity benefits annuity benefits reflect amounts accrued on annuity policyholders funds accumulated 
on its deferred annuities annuities in the accumulation phase  gafri generally credits interest to policyholders accounts at their current stated interest rates 
furthermore  for two tier deferred annuities annuities under which a higher interest amount can be earned if a policy is annuitized rather than surrendered  gafri accrues an additional liability to provide for expected deaths and annuitizations 
changes in crediting rates  actual surrender  death and annuitization experience or modifications in actuarial assumptions can affect this accrual 
in  this accrual was increased by approximately million due to trends in actual experience 
the majority of gafri s fixed annuity products permit gafri to change the crediting rate at any time subject to minimum interest rate guarantees as determined by applicable law 
in the fourth quarter of  gafri began issuing products with guaranteed minimum crediting rates of less than in states where required approvals have been received 
at december   approximately of annuity benefits accumulated related to policies with a minimum crediting rate of less than 
the remaining balance is split almost evenly between policies with minimum guarantee rates of and 
historically  management believes it has been able to react to changes in market interest rates and maintain a desired interest rate spread 
management believes that significant changes in projected investment yields could result in charges or credits to earnings in the period the projections are modified 
the increase in annuity benefits in compared to reflects the acquisition of the block of national health insurance company business 
annuity and life acquisition expenses annuity and life acquisition expenses include amortization of annuity and life  accident and health deferred policy acquisition costs dpac as well as a portion of commissions on sales of insurance products

compared to annuity and life acquisition expenses for were reduced by million related to trends in actual experience 
conversely  in  these expenses included net charges of million related to spread narrowing 
compared to the increase in annuity and life acquisition expenses in compared to reflects the continued narrowing of spreads in the fixed annuity operations  including the charges discussed above  and an increase in in force policies  primarily in the annuities and supplemental insurance operations 
the vast majority of gafri s dpac asset relates to its fixed annuity  variable annuity and life insurance lines of business 
continued spread compression  decreases in the stock market and adverse mortality could lead to write offs of dpac in the future 
interest on borrowed money changes in interest expense result from fluctuations in market rates as well as changes in borrowings 
afg has generally financed its borrowings on a long term basis which has resulted in higher current costs 
compared to interest expense for increased million compared to due primarily to higher average indebtedness and paydowns of lower variable rate bank debt with the proceeds from fixed rate debt offerings in the majority of the proceeds from debt issued in was used to retire higher coupon trust preferred securities 
accordingly  the increase in interest expense for was substantially offset by the million reduction in interest on subsidiary trust obligations see below 
compared to interest expense decreased in primarily due to lower average indebtedness and lower interest charges on amounts due reinsurers 
interest on subsidiary trust obligations interest on subsidiary trust obligations issued prior to was included in minority interest expense in and interest on subsidiary trust obligations decreased million for compared to due primarily to the march redemption of afg s trust preferred securities and gafri s trust preferred securities and gafri s first quarter repurchases of million of preferred securities

this charge resulted primarily from a change in accounting for persistency bonuses and two tier annuities 
in july  afg recorded a million after tax charge resulting from implementation of eitf  accounting for investments in limited liability companies 
this charge reflects the cumulative effect of changing from the cost method to the equity method of accounting for afg s investment in a limited liability company 
this charge reduced afg s investment in this entity to zero 
management believes the fair value of this investment substantially exceeds its carrying value prior to the writedown 
effective december   afg implemented interpretation no  consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation sets forth the requirements for determining the status of entities that do not share economic risk and reward through typical equity ownership  but rather through contractual relationships that distribute economic risks and rewards among various parties 
once an entity is determined to be a variable interest entity  it is required to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary  which is deemed to be the party that is exposed to a majority of the expected losses  or benefits from a majority of the expected residual returns  or both 
see note a accounting policies managed investment entity and payable to subsidiary trusts 
the cumulative effect of implementing fin was an increase in income of million 
effective january   afg implemented statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  under which goodwill is no longer amortized  but is subject to an impairment test at least annually 
the initial impairment testing resulted in a charge of million net of minority interest and taxes for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
recent accounting standards the following accounting standards have been or may be implemented by afg 
the implementation of these standards is discussed under various subheadings of note a to the financial statements  effects of each are shown in the relevant notes 
accounting standard subject of standard year implemented reference sop nontraditional long duration contracts and separate accounts eitf limited liability companies investments sfas r share based payment stock based compensation other standards issued in recent years did not apply to afg or had only negligible effects on afg 
proposed accounting standard the fasb has proposed an amendment to sfas  earnings per share 
currently  sfas allows companies issuing securities that can be settled in cash or stock such as afg s convertible notes to exclude the issuable shares from the calculation of diluted earnings per share when there is a stated intent and ability to deliver cash in lieu of stock upon settlement or conversion 
the proposed statement would require companies to assume settlement in stock despite the ability and intent to settle in cash and include those shares in the calculation of diluted earnings per share 
should the fasb proposal be adopted as proposed  afg anticipates that it will amend its indenture to eliminate the option to settle the accreted value of the notes in shares  and thereby mitigate the proposal s impact on dilution 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
afg s exposures to market risk relate primarily to its investment portfolio and annuity contracts which are exposed to interest rate risk and  to a lesser extent  equity price risk 
to a much lesser extent  afg s long term debt is also exposed to interest rate risk 
fixed maturity portfolio the fair value of afg s fixed maturity portfolio is directly impacted by changes in market interest rates 
afg s fixed maturity portfolio is comprised of substantially all fixed rate investments with primarily intermediate term maturities 
this practice allows flexibility in reacting to fluctuations of interest rates 
the portfolios of afg s insurance operations are managed with an attempt to achieve an adequate risk adjusted return while maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet policyholder obligations 
afg s life and annuity operations attempt to align the duration of their invested assets to the projected cash flows of policyholder liabilities 
the following table provides information about afg s available for sale fixed maturity investments at december  and  that are sensitive to interest rate risk 
the table shows principal cash flows in millions and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity date for each of the five subsequent years and for all years thereafter 
callable bonds and notes are included based on call date or maturity date depending upon which date produces the most conservative yield 
mortgage backed securities mbss and sinking fund issues are included based on maturity year adjusted for expected payment patterns 
actual cash flows may differ from those expected

although afg s investment in other stocks is less than of total investments  about three eighths of other stocks is invested in national city corporation 
annuity contracts substantially all of gafri s fixed rate annuity contracts permit gafri to change crediting rates subject to minimum interest rate guarantees as determined by applicable law enabling management to react to changes in market interest rates 
in the fourth quarter of  gafri began issuing products with guaranteed minimum crediting rates of less than in states where required approvals have been received 
actuarial assumptions used to estimate dpac and certain annuity liabilities  as well as gafri s ability to maintain spread  could be impacted if the current interest rate environment continues for an extended period and causes policyholder behavior to be altered 
projected payments in millions in each of the subsequent five years and for all years thereafter on gafri s fixed annuity liabilities at december were as follows 
fair first second third fourth fifth thereafter total value approximately of gafri s fixed annuity liabilities at december   were two tier in nature in that policyholders can receive a higher amount if they annuitize rather than surrender their policy  even if the surrender charge period has expired 
at december   the average stated crediting rate on the in force block of gafri s principal fixed annuity products was approximately 
the current stated crediting rates excluding bonus interest on new sales of gafri s products generally range from to 
gafri estimates that its effective weighted average crediting rate on its in force business over the next five years will approximate 
this rate reflects actuarial assumptions as to i expected investment spreads  ii deaths  iii annuitizations  iv surrenders and v renewal premiums 
actual experience and changes in actuarial assumptions may result in different effective crediting rates than those above 
gafri s equity indexed fixed annuities represent less than of gafri s insurance reserves at december  these annuities provide policyholders with a crediting rate tied  in part  to the performance of an existing stock market index 
gafri attempts to mitigate the risk in the equity based component of these products through the purchase of call options on the appropriate index 
gafri s strategy is designed so that an increase in the liabilities  due to an increase in the market index  will be substantially offset by unrealized and realized gains on the call options purchased by gafri 
under sfas no 
 both the equity based component of the annuities and the related call options are considered derivatives and marked to market through current earnings as annuity benefits 
adjusting these derivatives to market value had a net effect of less than of annuity benefits in and in  gafri chose to suspend new sales of equity indexed annuities due primarily to lack of volume
