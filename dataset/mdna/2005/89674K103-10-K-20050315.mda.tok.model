item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  the related notes and the important notice to investors that appear elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a supplier of high performance components and modules for communications applications 
our focus is on the specialized expertise  materials and know how for radio frequency rf  intermediate frequency if and optical applications 
we enjoy diversity in our markets  applications  products  technology and customer base 
our markets include wireless phones  wireless infrastructure networks  optical networks  and defense 
we provide customers with standard and custom product solutions as well as foundry services 
our products are designed on various wafer substrates including compound semiconductor materials such as gallium arsenide gaas and indium phosphate inp and other materials such as quartz  as well as using a variety of semiconductor device process technologies and surface acoustic wave saw technology 
using these materials  devices and our proprietary technology  our products can overcome the performance barriers of competing devices in a variety of applications and offer other key advantages such as steeper selectivity  lower distortion  reduced size and weight and more precise frequency control 
for example  gaas has inherent physical properties that allow its electrons to move up to five times faster than those of silicon 
this higher electron mobility permits the manufacture of gaas integrated circuits that operate at higher levels of performance than silicon devices 
our customers include major communication companies worldwide 
strategy and industry considerations our business strategy is to provide our customers with high performance  low cost solutions to applications in the wireless phone  wireless infrastructure  optical network  and defense markets 
our goal is to build a strong and sustainable business by applying our core competencies and technologies to a diversified portfolio of markets within the communications industry 
in wireless phones  we provide high performance rf filters  duplexers  receivers  small signal components  power amplifiers  switches  and integrated passive components 
we have also been a developer of rf front end modules with the goal of maximizing content and minimizing stacked margins 
in wireless infrastructure networks  we are a supplier of active and passive components for rf communications and we are the dominant supplier of saw filters to base stations 
we estimate the global number of subscribers to wireless communications to grow from approximately billion in to approximately billion by in optical networks  we are a supplier of laser and detector components 
in the defense market  we are a provider of phased array antenna components to the us military 
this has been a stable business for us due to the long lead times and long product life cycles 
the semiconductor industry in general has been subject to slumping demand and excess capacity since this has been the case for our business as well 
wafer and semiconductor manufacturing facilities represent a very high level of fixed cost due to investments in plant and equipment  labor costs  and repair and maintenance costs 
during periods of low demand  selling prices also tend to decrease which  when combined with high fixed manufacturing costs  can create a material adverse impact on operating results 
wireless phone demand  however  generally strengthened during  especially during the seasonally stronger second half of the year  and has continued during the first nine months of  although we experienced a slowdown with our products for this market for the fourth quarter of the total global unit shipments for the whole market grew by more than  resulting in projected shipments of over million handsets in we also believe we are positioned for sustained demand in the wireless phone market for due to continued demand in china  india and other emerging countries  strong interest in camera phones and color displays worldwide  and increasing acceptance of non voice applications such as text messaging 
as the handset market expands  we expect this to also create increased demand in the wireless infrastructure market for our base station and point to point components 
as with the semiconductor industry  the optical communication industry has also suffered since as restructuring and consolidation in the optical network market continues  we believe strengthening long term market demand may result 
however  over the past year demand has been relatively stable and the near term outlook appears flat 
the defense market is stable and long term 
revenues from this market decreased approximately in from and accounted for approximately of our revenues for fiscal year as compared to of our revenues in fiscal year however  we are actively engaged with multiple defense industry contractors in the development of next generation phased array systems  have key design wins in major projects such as the joint strike fighter and f  and expect to participate in other large projects such as the b radar upgrade 
we expect these programs to ramp up over and  however  there remains uncertainty about long term defense projects funding due to the negative impact that the war in iraq continues to have on defense related spending for large scale programs in which we participate 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following accounting policies involve a critical accounting estimate because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period and changes in the accounting estimates we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
our most critical accounting estimates include revenue recognition  the valuation of inventory  which impacts gross margin  assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  which primarily impacts operating expense when we impair assets or accelerate depreciation  valuation of investments in privately held companies  which impacts net income when we record impairments  deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which impacts our tax provision  reserve for warranty costs  which impacts gross margin  and stock based compensation 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as our policies for the valuation of accounts receivable  reserves for sales returns and allowances  and reserves for commitments and contingencies  however  these policies either do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates described above or are not currently material items in our financial statements 
we review our estimates  judgments  and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are deemed to be necessary 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable  however  actual results could differ from these estimates 
recognition of revenue we derive revenues primarily from the sale of standard and customer specific products and services in the wireless phone  infrastructure network such as base station  satellite  and point to point radios  defense and optical networks 
we also receive revenues from foundry services  non recurring engineering fees and cost plus contracts for research and development work  which collectively are less than of consolidated revenues for any period 
sales of our products are generally done through either our sales force and independent manufacturers representatives or through our stocking distributor 
the majority of our shipments are made directly to our customers  with shipments to our manufacturing representatives and stocking distributor accounting for less than of total revenues in and  respectively 
revenues from the sale of standard and customer specific products are recognized when title to the products pass to the buyer 
revenues from foundry services and non recurring engineering fees are recorded when the service is completed or upon certain milestones as provided for in the agreements 
revenues from cost plus contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method based on the costs incurred to date and the total contract amount  plus the contractual fee 
revenues from our distributor are recognized when the product is sold to the distributor 
our distribution agreements provide for selling prices that are fixed at the date of sale  although we occasionally offer price concessions which are specific  of a fixed duration and are reserved for 
further  the distributor is obligated to pay the amount and it is not contingent on reselling the product  the distributor takes title to the product and bears substantially all of the risks of ownership  the distributor has economic substance  we have no significant obligations for future performance to bring about resale  and the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
we allow our distributor to return products for warranty reasons as well as exchange products  within certain limitations 
customers can only return product for warranty reasons 
if we are unable to repair or replace products returned under warranty  we will issue a credit for a warranty return 
inventories we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we use a combination of standard cost and moving average cost methodologies to determine our cost basis for our inventories 
this methodology approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
in addition to stating our inventory at a lower of cost or market valuation  we also evaluate it each period for excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes identifying those parts specifically identified as obsolete and reserving for them  analyzing forecasted demand versus quantities on hand and reserving for the excess  identifying and recording other specific reserves  and estimating and recording a general reserve based on historical experience and our judgment of economic conditions 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly  additional inventory reserves may be required and would have a negative impact on our gross margin in the period the adjustment is made 
long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets for impairment of their carrying value when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we may consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends  significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets  plant closure or production line discontinuance  technological obsolescence  or other changes in circumstances which indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
if impairment appears probable  we evaluate whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value 
if this is the case  we recognize an impairment loss to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value 
fair value is determined based on market prices or discounted cash flow analysis  depending on the nature of the asset 
any estimate of future cash flows is inherently uncertain 
the factors we take into consideration in making estimates of future cash flows include product life cycles  pricing trends  future capital needs  cost trends  product development costs  competitive factors and technology trends as they each affect cash inflows and outflows 
technology markets are highly cyclical and are characterized by rapid shifts in demand that are difficult to predict in terms of direction and severity 
if an asset is written down to fair value that becomes the asset s new carrying value  which is depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset 
investments in privately held companies we have made a number of investments in small  privately held technology companies in which we hold less than of the capital stock or hold notes receivable 
we account for these investments at their cost unless their value has been determined to be other than temporarily impaired  in which case we write the investment down to its impaired value 
we review these investments periodically for impairment and make appropriate reductions in carrying value when an other than temporary decline is evident  however  for non marketable equity securities  the impairment analysis requires significant judgment 
we evaluate the financial condition of the investee  market conditions  and other factors providing an indication of the fair value of the investments 
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the investees could result in additional other than temporary losses in future periods 
see note of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent events regarding our investments in privately held companies 
income taxes we are subject to taxation from federal  state and international jurisdictions 
a significant amount of management judgment is involved with our annual provision for income taxes and the calculation of resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we evaluate liabilities for estimated tax exposures in jurisdictions of operation 
these tax jurisdictions include federal  state and international tax jurisdictions 
significant income tax exposures include potential challenges on foreign entities  merger  acquisition and disposition transactions and intercompany pricing 
exposures are settled primarily through the completion of audits within these tax jurisdictions  but can also be affected by other factors 
changes could cause management to find a revision of past estimates appropriate 
the liabilities are frequently reviewed by management for their adequacy and appropriateness 
as of december   we were not currently under audit by the taxing authorities 
we concluded federal income tax audits for the us consolidated tax group on earlier years  most recently for the years and we are scheduled for an audit of our german subsidiary triquint semiconductor gmbh in tax periods within the statutory period of limitations not previously audited are potentially open for examination by the taxing authorities 
potential liabilities associated with these years will be resolved when an event occurs to warrant closure  primarily through the completion of audits by the taxing jurisdictions 
to the extent audits or other events result in a material adjustment to the accrued estimates  the effect would be recognized during the period of the event 
management believes that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures  though the potential exists for results to materially vary from these estimates 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
we consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a regular basis and adjust as needed 
these adjustments have an impact on our financial statements in the periods in which they are recorded 
in  we determined that a valuation allowance should be recorded against all of our deferred tax assets based on the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as of december   this valuation allowance is still in place 
warranty costs we sell our products with warranties that they will be free of faulty workmanship or defective materials and that they will conform to our published specifications or other specifications mutually agreed to with a customer 
in some cases  we have assumed the existing warranties on products previously sold by businesses we have acquired  such as the agere optoelectronics business 
we have also established a reserve for potential catastrophic warranty claims for cases in which our obligation may extend beyond the repair and replacement of a faulty product 
we estimate the potential liability associated with these warranties based on a combination of factors including historical product return experience  known product warranty issues with specific customers  and judgment of expected levels of returns based on economic and other factors 
an accrual for expected warranty costs results in a charge to the financial results in the period recorded 
this liability can be difficult to estimate and  if we experience warranty claims in excess of our projections  we may need to record additional accruals which would adversely affect our financial results 
we allow only our stocking distributor to exchange product for other than warranty reasons 
if we are unable to repair or replace a product returned under warranty  we will issue a credit for a warranty return 
stock based compensation we account for compensation cost related to employee stock options and other forms of employee stock based compensation plans other than esop in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
as such  compensation expense would be recorded on the date of grant only if the current market prices of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price 
we apply financial accounting standards board fasb sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which allows entities to continue to apply the provision of apb no 
and provide pro forma net income and pro forma earnings per share disclosures for employee stock option grants as if the fair value based method defined in sfas no 
had been applied 
the accounting for stock based compensation involves a number of estimates about the expected lives of stock options  interest rates  stock volatility  and assumptions as well as the selection of a valuation model 
we have selected to use the black scholes option valuation model 
a change in any of these estimates or a selection of a different option pricing model could have a material impact on our pro forma net income loss disclosures 
beginning in the third quarter of  we will be required to account for stock based compensation under sfas no 
r  share based payment  which will require us to recognize the estimate on our financial statements 
see recent accounting pronouncements below for a further discussion 
acquisitions agere s optoelectronics business on january   we completed an acquisition of a substantial portion of the optoelectronics business of agere systems inc agere for million in cash plus acquisition costs and certain assumed liabilities 
the transaction included the products  technology and some facilities related to agere s optoelectronics business  which includes active and passive components  amplifiers  transceivers and other products

assets held for sale during and  we determined that we will sell the land  building and certain assets associated with our optoelectronics operation in pennsylvania  excess equipment associated with our semiconductor manufacturing operations in texas and oregon and assets obtained from the liquidation of an investment we had in another company 
the pennsylvania property consists of several buildings comprising approximately  square feet of space on approximately acres of land that we classified as held for sale in the second quarter of the buildings contain fabrication and assembly space  office space  and central services 
during and we were in negotiations to so sell the pennsylvania facility  however in the fourth quarter of  we were notified by the potential buyer that it was not going to purchase the facility 
we subsequently recorded an impairment charge of million to reduce the value of the building to its current market value of million 
on march   we entered into an agreement to sell the pennsylvania facility to a real estate investment firm and lease back approximately  square feet of the facility for continuing operations 
the sale is subject to customary closing procedures and is expected to be completed with days of signing the agreement see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the assets associated with our optoelectronics operations consists of a variety of equipment used for optoelectronics fabrication and assembly operations as well as intangible assets that we classified as held for sale in the fourth quarter of as a result for our optoelectronics restructuring approximately million at december  
the assets in texas and oregon consist of a variety of equipment used for semiconductor and fabrication and assembly operations million 
additionally  we received million of assets from the liquidation of a company in which we had an investment 
we are actively marketing these assets and have met the accounting criteria for classifying these assets as held for sale  accordingly  they are identified on our balance sheet as assets held for sale 
the carrying value of assets held for sale at december  and was million and million  respectively see note of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
results of operations the following table sets forth the results of our operations expressed as a percentage of revenues 
our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
years ended december  revenues cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research  development and engineering selling  general and administrative in process research and development reduction in workforce impairment of long lived assets and goodwill gain on disposal of equipment lease termination costs total operating expenses loss from operations other income expense interest income interest expense foreign currency gain loss impairment charge investments of other companies gain on recovery of previously impaired investment gain on retirement of debt other  net total other income expenses  net loss before income tax income tax expense benefit net loss years ended december  and revenues our operating results improved significantly during  from a net loss of million for the year ended december  to a net loss of million for the year ended december  our total operating results were primarily influenced by improvements in total revenues from strengthening demand in most of our markets  our introduction of and customer acceptance of new products  improvements in gross margin and reductions in operating expenses resulting from our cost reduction efforts  increased capacity utilization from increased demand and the absence of lease termination costs which were incurred in these improvements were partially offset by greater losses of our optoelectronics products in as compared to our revenues increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  compared million for the year ended december  this increase in revenues is primarily due to increased shipments of products for the infrastructure networks markets  specifically for applications for base stations for wireless communications  wireless local area networks wlan  point to point radios  and satellite  and increased revenue for products for wireless phones 
the increase in revenues more than offsets declines in defense related products and flat revenue for products for optical networks 
the overall demand for our products was strong in the first six months of  but started to diminish in the latter part of the third quarter of  and continued at a lower level in the fourth quarter of  specifically in products for wireless phones  satellite communications  base stations and wlan 
our book to bill ratio for the full year ended december  was to  compared to a book to bill ratio of to for the year ended december  our revenues by end market for the years ended december  and were as follows years ended december  revenues wireless phones infrastructure networks defense optical networks wireless phones our wireless phone market revenues are from electronic components for mobile phones including filters  amplifiers  receivers  duplexers  switches  mixers and other related items 
we sell these parts to phone manufactures worldwide 
the demand for components parts has been historically driven by the increasing usage of wireless phones and due to the complexity of wireless phones utilizing features such as multiband and global positioning systems which require more components 
worldwide  the total number of wireless phones in use continues to grow with asia and eastern europe growing at the fastest rates 
there are a number of wireless phone standards in use 
gsm  cdma  and tdma refer to the primary wireless air interface standards used throughout the world 
gsm global system for mobile communications is the most prevalent standard  utilized primarily in europe and many parts of asia with a growing presence in the us this standard accounts for over of total phone sales and subscribers worldwide 
cdma code division multiple access is the standard used principally in north and south america  korea  and parts of china and india 
historically  we have more sales into cdma applications as many of our products  such as if saw filters  receivers  duplexers  and triplexers are better suited for cdma and in some cases are not used in gsm 
tdma time division multiple access is an older digital air interface standard that wireless phone manufacturers are phasing out 
our efforts to design and introduce products based on the gsm standard are an important element in our strategy and we believe we are gaining share in this large market 
our revenues from products for wireless phones increased approximately in  due to the overall strength in end market demand for wireless phones  especially in asia 
we experienced an increase in revenues from new products  specifically pas and pams for wireless phones  which grew from approximately million in revenues last year  to approximately million in our new integrated rf front end module also experienced a significant increase in revenues compared to as did our duplexer products for cdma phones and our rf filter products for both cdma and gsm applications 
revenues from if filters  low noise amplifiers and mixers declined in compared to as these products are older products and are being phased out by direct conversion architectures in newer phone models which do not need these products 
overall  revenues for cdma based applications accounted for about of our revenues from wireless phones in  compared to last year  but our gsm based products are growing and now account for of our wireless phone revenues  up from a year ago 
revenues from tdma based phones are declining rapidly and now account for only about of our wireless phone revenues in  compared to approximately for last year 
unit shipments remain high and we shipped our highest ever quantity of devices for the wireless phone market in pricing  which at times may be under severe competitive pressure  was relatively stable and our average selling prices for products for wireless phones were flat overall compared to we shipped more higher dollar value module based products such as gsm power amplifier and rf front end modules  which offset price declines for our other wireless phone products 
infrastructure networks the infrastructure networks market includes a variety of applications such as base stations  point to point radios  satellite systems  broadband cable  wlan  automotive  and standard products 
this end market has been the fastest growing for us over the past year due in part to an overall recovery in infrastructure spending  new applications and new products 
overall  our revenues in this market increased by approximately in compared to our largest source of revenues in this market is from base stations  which increased by approximately in  compared to base station revenues increased due to increased volumes of filters and other devices for this market 
base stations are used to handle calls from wireless phones and  as usage of mobile phones increases  the demand for more and better base stations grows 
while shipments were extremely robust for base station products in the first three quarters of  the bookings for these products in the third and fourth quarter of declined 
other applications in this market that experienced an increase in revenues in compared to include point to point radios  wlan  and satellite systems 
defense revenues from our defense related market decreased by approximately in compared to  due to the timing and roll out of large scale defense programs and the negative impact that the war in iraq has had on defense related spending for fighter jets and research and development 
the defense department has allocated more of its budget for current operations and has deferred some orders for longer term programs 
our products for this market typically are for phased array antenna and similar applications for airborne systems and these programs normally have long lead times 
optical networks revenues from products of optical networks were essentially unchanged in compared to however  our revenues in this market declined in the second half of and fell below our expectations 
the optical component market continues to suffer from excess capacity  sluggish demand and price competition 
on november   we announced that we are repositioning our strategy to address this market 
as part of the announcement  we are exiting certain module related products for this market which may result in lower projected revenue for for this market 
domestic and international revenues revenues from domestic customers were million in  compared to million in revenues from international customers were million in compared to million in revenues continue to grow due to the increasing demand for wireless phones and infrastructure products from countries in asia  south america  and eastern europe where wireless subscriber penetration rates are significantly lower than penetration rates in the us and western europe 
revenues from korea  the only foreign country which represented or more of revenues  were million in and million in  respectively 
revenues generated from us operations were million in and million in  respectively 
revenues generated from our international operations were million in and million in  respectively 
transfers between these operations were million in and million in  respectively 
our us operations accounted for million of our long lived assets in and million in our international operations accounted for million of our long lived assets in and million in gross profit gross profit is defined as revenues less cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold includes direct material  labor and overhead expenses and certain production costs related to non recurring engineering revenues 
in general  we derive a higher gross profit margin on lower volume products for the infrastructure network market products such as base stations  point to point radios and satellite systems  whereas products for the wireless phone and wlan market are higher volume  price sensitive  and generally lower margin products 
our gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues increased to in  compared to in the increase was primarily due to increased sales of products for the network infrastructure market such as filters and components for base stations  point to point radio  and satellite systems which have higher gross profit margins than our consumer driven products such as wireless phones 
in addition  the higher overall revenues in compared to allows for more absorption of fixed costs 
additionally  the results for included numerous transition related costs associated with the purchase of the optoelectronics business from agere systems in early which negatively affected gross margins 
we incurred no such charges in we also recorded a benefit of approximately million in associated with the reclaim of platinum and gold from our pennsylvania and texas manufacturing operations 
precious metals are a primary component of our semiconductor fabrication process 
process wastes are routinely collected and processed to reclaim the precious metal component 
in the case of our pennsylvania operation  we reclaimed million of platinum in that was embedded in equipment that was in excess of our needs 
we did not recognize any gain on reclamation of platinum in the operation of our own wafer fabrication facilities entails a high degree of fixed costs and requires an adequate volume of production and sales to be profitable 
during periods of decreased demand  high fixed wafer fabrication costs have a materially adverse effect on our operating results 
as of the end of  three of our four fabrication facilities are running at under utilization capacity 
our saw filter fabrication facility was running at over utilization capacity 
we routinely review our accounting reserves  including those for excess and obsolete inventory and potential warranty claims  as described under critical accounting policies and estimates above  and make adjustments as necessary 
when we initially acquired the optoelectronics business from agere systems in january  we established warranty reserves during the three months ended march   using engineering failure rate data obtained from agere 
we have continued to refine our estimates for warranty reserves and have developed data from returns during the course of accordingly  during  we recorded a reduction to the warranty reserve for our optoelectronics operations totaling approximately million due to a change in the methodology we use to estimate the reserve 
in addition  we identified a portion of the remaining warranty reserve balance for catastrophic warranty claims 
this was done in response to increasing requests by our customers for catastrophic warranty clauses that extend our obligation beyond the repair and replacement of a faulty product  to include other losses our customers may experience as a result of failures in our products 
we experienced one such warranty claim during during  warranty reserves decreased million  largely due to the resolution of certain warranty claims 
also  during  gross inventory decreased million and corresponding inventory reserves decreased million as compared to the decrease in the warranty reserve was primarily due to consumption of previously reserved inventories by the optoelectronics operations 
research  development and engineering expenses research  development and engineering expenses include the costs incurred in the design of new products  as well as ongoing product research and development expenses 
our research  development and engineering expenses for the year ended december  decreased million to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of our cost reduction programs implemented during  which included reductions in our workforce  a change in our procedures on development of wafers  a consolidation of vendors for certain purchases  use of common computer aided design tools and reduced work hours 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include commissions  labor expenses for marketing and administrative personnel  and other corporate administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the commission and sales related expenses associated with our higher revenues in  as well as increased administrative costs to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of in process research and development in  we recorded a charge of million for the write off of acquired in process research and development associated with our acquisition of the agere optoelectronics business 
we recorded no similar charge during reduction in workforce in  we recorded net severance costs of million related to reductions in our workforce of approximately employees in pennsylvania and approximately employees in mexico associated with our optoelectronics operations and approximately employees assigned to our texas operations 
included in this amount is a credit of million to reflect a reduction in the number of employees originally expected to be impacted from the agere acquisition 
during  we recorded severance costs of million 
these costs related to reductions in our workforce of approximately employees  resulting from our efforts to align our costs and capacity with our levels of production and revenues 
these reductions primarily impacted the workforce of our newly acquired optoelectronics operations and our german engineering and marketing operations 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill in  we recorded impairments to long lived assets of million 
we did not have any charges for impairments in the impairments recorded in include impairments of our optoelectronics facility in pennsylvania million  optoelectronic module manufacturing equipment million  excess six inch wafer fabrication equipment million  and a charge associated with the closing of our tianjin  china facility million 
in regard to the optoelectronics facility  we were in negotiations to sell the fabrication facility located in breinigsville  pennsylvania for more than one year with an agency of the commonwealth of pennsylvania 
we acquired the building as part of our acquisition of a portion of the optoelectronics business from agere systems in january at the time of the acquisition  we determined the value of the facility to be million  and recorded it on our books after a reduction due to purchase accounting adjustments at million 
on october   we were informed that this agency was not going to purchase the facility 
in may of  we engaged a national real estate agency to market the facility with an asking price of million 
at that time  we reclassified the facility to assets held for sale 
at december   we continued to hold the facility as held for sale  and in the first quarter of we entered into an agreement to sell the facility to a real estate investment firm and lease back approximately  square feet of the facility for continuing operations see note to our consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the optoelectronics restructuring we announced in october  we reviewed the carrying value of all of our optoelectronics related assets and recorded an impairment of million related to specialized module manufacturing equipment during the fourth quarter of additionally  we recorded an impairment charge of million on certain six inch wafer fabrication equipment to current market values 
the equipment was in excess of our needs and had been classified as held for sale 
the million charge associated with the tianjin  china facility was related to leasehold and other assets 
the closure was made as our primary customer in the region no longer required a manufacturing presence in the region and is expected to reduce employee expenses approximately million per year 
gain on disposal of equipment in  we recorded a million gain on the disposal of equipment  primarily related to the sale of equipment at our optoelectronics facility 
the optoelectronic equipment sold had been classified as held for sale 
we recorded no similar gains in lease termination costs in  we recorded a charge of million for costs associated with the termination of the lease on our wafer fabrication facility located in richardson  texas 
under the original lease agreement sponsored by a financial institution  we were required to make lease payments through august or purchase the property at that time 
in june  we notified the lender of our intention to terminate the lease and purchase the property 
the purchase was completed in july we incurred no similar costs in and have no similar lease agreements in place at december  interest income expense  net interest income expense  net decreased as an expense million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million in this change was attributable to higher interest rates earned on our short and long term investments as interest rates on these investments rose in as compared to for example  in the average commercial paper interest rate was compared to in further  we repurchased million of our subordinated debt in which also reduced our interest expense 
foreign currency gain loss in  we recorded a foreign currency gain of million  as compared to a foreign currency loss of million for the year ended december  the gain in was primarily attributable to foreign currency receivables of million approximately million at the exchange rate in effect at the time of the transactions that were reclassified as short term monetary asset in the third quarter 
as a result of the reclassification  we recorded a foreign currency gain of million on the remeasurment of the receivables as the euro strengthened relative to the us dollar 
in november  we received payment on the receivable 
impairment charge investment in other companies in  we recorded impairment losses of million as a result of either cessation of operations  deteriorating financial condition or a reduction in our pro rata ownership of the privately held company in which we had invested 
in  we recorded impairment losses of million  respectively  as a result of either deteriorating financial condition or cessation of operations of the privately held company in which we had invested 
additionally in  we received a cash settlement on a previously impaired promissory note from one of the privately held investees  resulting in a gain of million 
the following table provides a summary of the impairments during fiscal years and in millions year description impairment impairment of investment in an optoelectronics company that ceased operations  net of expected proceeds from recovered assets impairment of investments in two privately held companies based on deteriorating financial conditions and or reduction in our pro rata ownership total impairments in impairment of investments in privately held semiconductor companies based on deteriorating financial conditions impairment of investments in privately held companies that ceased operations impairment of investment in privately held optoelectronics company based on its deteriorating financial condition total impairments in gain on retirement of debt in  we recorded a gain on the retirement of debt resulting from our repurchase of million principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes at the then current market prices resulting in a gain of million  net of the write off of associated capitalized bond issuance costs of million 
we recorded no similar benefit in as we did not repurchase any debt during that fiscal year 
from time to time  we may repurchase additional notes in the open market 
income tax expense benefit in  we recorded income tax expense of million as compared to an income tax benefit of million in the income tax expense in was primarily the result of income taxes in foreign jurisdictions 
the income tax benefit in was primarily the result of the settlement of certain prior year tax accruals and refunds 
years ended december  and our operating results improved significantly from a net loss of million in to a net loss of million in our total operating results were influenced during primarily by improvements in total revenues from strengthening demand in most of our markets  our introduction of and customer acceptance of new products  and the addition of the newly acquired optoelectronics operations  reductions in operating expenses primarily due to the elimination of a lease obligation associated with our texas facility in  and increased capacity utilization from increased demand 
these gains were partially offset by losses of our newly acquired optoelectronics operations 
the optoelectronics operation was acquired with more capacity than necessary to support the size of the business and have subsequently repositioned our strategy in the optoelectronics market 
revenues our revenues increased to million in from million in of this increase from to  million was attributable to the optoelectronics operations we acquired from agere in january our revenues in  as compared to  increased for wireless phone and wlan products  but decreased for other infrastructure network products and decreased slightly for defense related products 
the majority of our shipments are made directly to our customers  with shipments to distributors accounting for only approximately of our total revenues in our revenues by end market for the years ended december  and were as follows years ended december  revenues wireless phones infrastructure networks defense optical networks wireless phones on an absolute dollar basis  our revenues from the wireless phone market increased from to this increase was driven by increased end market demand due to new phone subscribers in asia  the popularity of new feature rich phones which include color screens and digital photography  and our new product introductions 
the worldwide sales of wireless phones grew by over to approximately million phones in pricing on component parts  such as the products that we sell  declined generally  while our unit shipments increased 
for example  we increased our total shipments of rf saw filters by nearly in compared to  while average selling prices for these products declined over over the same time period 
we shipped a record number of saw filters  began shipments of a new power amplifier module for the gsm market  and have increased sales of a new receiver product for cdma phones 
our revenue in the wireless phone market is dominated by sales for cdma applications  accounting for of our wireless phone revenue  followed by gsm applications at and tdma at in this in comparison to  in which cdma accounted for  gsm  and tdma of total wireless phone revenues 
tdma is an older digital air interface standard that is being phased out 
in the fourth quarter of  our sales into tdma applications were only of our total wireless phone revenue and we expect this level to further decline over time 
we have more sales into cdma applications as many of our products  such as if saw filters  receivers  duplexers  and triplexers are better suited for cdma and in some cases are not used in gsm 
gsm is the world s largest air interface standard  accounting for over of total phone sales and subscribers 
infrastructure networks our infrastructure network products address a variety of application areas  such as base stations  satellite  point to point radios  and wlan 
base station products comprise our largest proportion of this business  but decreased significantly in to of network infrastructure revenue from in due to price declines and continued softness in this market 
wlan product revenues increased in proportion from of infrastructure revenue in to in this increase was driven by increasing demand for standard products used in many of the new personal computer and laptop computer for wireless access to the internet 
we maintain a very high market share for many of the products we supply to the infrastructure network market 
this is a highly competitive market  however  and is characterized by intense pressure on selling prices 
defense revenues from our defense business declined slightly from to we believe this was caused by a temporary shift of government funding from research and development and long term programs toward short term spending related to conflicts in iraq and afghanistan 
our business in this market is very stable and we have a strong position  particularly for phased array antenna and communications systems 
optical networks products addressing optical network applications have become a much bigger part of our overall revenues since our acquisition of agere s optoelectronics business in early january  growing from of our total revenues in to in revenues from our legacy optoelectronics products such as multiplexers  demultiplexers  and transimpedence amplifiers have been declining in recent years and that trend continued in domestic and international revenues domestic and international revenues were million and million  respectively  in as compared to million and million  respectively  in the shift in the proportion of our total revenues from international sources from in to in reflects the increasing demand from countries in asia  africa  and south america  where wireless subscriber penetration rates are cumulatively or less  compared to penetration rates in the us and europe of approximately  and the need to develop the wireless infrastructure in these regions 
gross profit gross profit decreased to million in from million in our gross profit also decreased as measured as a percentage of revenues  from in to in this decline in our gross profitability was attributable primarily to the following factors excessive cost structure and an extremely competitive pricing environment in the optoelectronics business we acquired from agere in early january  continued underutilization of our oregon and texas wafer fabrication plants  and lower prices for our products for wireless phones and base stations 
as of the end of  our oregon gaas fabrication facility was operating at only utilization  our texas fabrication facility was operating at less than utilization  and our optoelectronics manufacturing facility in pennsylvania was operating at less than of its capacity 
our saw filter factories were operating at over utilization as of the end of during  we implemented several measures to reduce our cost and capacity levels to more closely match demand 
we reduced ongoing operating expenses by approximately million by disposing of non strategic elements of the optoelectronics business acquired from agere  saved approximately million by transferring the manufacturing associated with the products we acquired from infineon to our fabrication facility in oregon  saved approximately million by reducing work schedules  and reduced operating expenses by approximately million by moving the majority of the assembly and test operations associated with our optoelectronics products in pennsylvania to our plant in matamoros  mexico 
other efforts aimed at improving utilization of our manufacturing facilities included shipping a record number of mm gaas wafers from our oregon fabrication facility and record yields in our pennsylvania and texas fabrication facilities 
most of the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by intense price pressure 
the average selling prices of many of our products decreased during our strategy for maintaining profitability under these conditions is to maintain tight control of our spending  implementing measures to maintain the proper level of capacity such as those described above  and continuing to aggressively develop new products 
research  development and engineering expenses research  development and engineering expenses include the costs incurred in the design of new products  as well as ongoing product research and development expenses 
our research  development and engineering expenses increased in to million from million in research  development and engineering expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to in from in the increase in research  development and engineering expenses on an absolute dollar basis was primarily due to the additional research  development and engineering activities associated with our newly acquired businesses from infineon and agere and to the ongoing costs associated with our ongoing investment in wireless  broadband  microwave  and optoelectronics products and technologies 
we introduced new products in  including several key products  such as our gsm module products  a family of wlan products  and a family of small form factor optical transceiver products 
as a percentage of revenue  the decrease from to was attributable to the increase in revenues from to selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include commissions  labor expenses for marketing and administrative personnel  and other corporate administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in compared to in this spending increase was primarily due to increased selling expenses associated with increased revenues and additional costs associated with our acquisition of the infineon and agere businesses 
in process research and development in  we recorded a charge of million for the write off of acquired ipr d associated with our acquisition of the agere optoelectronics business 
during  we recorded a charge of million for the write off of acquired ipr d and other costs associated with our acquisition of the infineon and ibm businesses 
reduction in workforce in  we recorded severance costs of million 
these costs relate to reductions in our workforce of approximately employees  resulting from our efforts to align our costs and capacity with our levels of production and revenues 
these reductions primarily impacted the workforce of our newly acquired optoelectronics operations and our german engineering and marketing operations 
during  we reduced our workforce by approximately employees also as a result of the decreased demand for our products and the underutilization of our fabrication facilities 
we recorded a charge of million associated with this reduction in workforce 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill we recorded no charges from the impairment of long lived assets in  however  in we recorded impairment charges of million 
the impairment charge in was the result of the abandonment of million of certain production assets associated with one of our six inch wafer productions lines at our richardson facility  the writedown of million of certain equipment and facilities associated with excess capacity at our oregon facility and the impairment of million of goodwill and other intangibles associated with our acquisitions of businesses from ibm and infineon 
the businesses acquired from ibm and infineon were assigned to the oregon operating unit when purchased 
the determination and recording of an impairment of the value of certain assets associated with the oregon operating units was an event which also required the evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill associated with the acquisition of the ibm and infineon businesses  since these businesses are associated with the oregon operating unit 
the anticipated effect on depreciation expense of the impairment was approximately million per year 
lease termination costs in  we recorded a charge of million for costs associated with the termination of the lease on our wafer fabrication facility located in richardson  texas 
under the original lease agreement sponsored by a financial institution  we were required to make lease payments through august or purchase the property at that time 
in june  we notified the lender of our intention to terminate the lease and purchase the property 
the purchase was completed in july we incurred no similar costs in and have no similar lease agreements in place at december  interest income expense  net interest income expense  net increased as an expense to million in compared to an expense of approximately million in this change was attributable to lower interest rates earned on investments and a lower level of cash and short and long term investments due to our recent capital investments and acquisitions 
impairment charge investment in other companies in and  we recorded impairment losses of million and million  respectively  on impairments of investments we have made in small  privately held technology companies 
the impairments in were the result of either deteriorating financial condition of the company or cessation of operations of the company 
additionally in  we received a cash settlement on a previously impaired promissory note from one of the privately held investees described above  resulting in a gain of million 
we had no similar gain in the following table provides a summary of the impairments during fiscal years and in millions year description impairment impairment of investments in privately held semiconductor companies based on deteriorating financial conditions impairment of investments in privately held companies that ceased operations impairment of investment in privately held optoelectronics company based on its deteriorating financial condition total impairments in impairment of investments in privately held technology companies based on deteriorating financial conditions that subsequently either were liquidated or filed for bankruptcy impairment of investment in privately held rf integrated circuit company based on its deteriorating financial condition due to lack of revenue and reduced cash position 
company later was sold in and investment was largely recovered 
impairment of investments in privately held technology companies based on deteriorating financial conditions total impairments in gain on retirement of debt in we recorded a gain on retirement of debt resulted from our repurchase of million principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes at the then current market prices resulting in a gain of million 
we repurchased no additional debt in and recorded no similar gain 
other  net other  net for the year ended december  was a net expense of million as compared to net income of million for the year ended december  the income in was primarily due to a realized gain of million on a forward currency contract associated with the infineon acquisition 
we had no similar gain in income tax expense benefit in  we recorded an income tax benefit of million compared to an income tax expense of million recorded in the income tax benefit in was primarily the result of the settlement of certain prior year tax accruals and refunds 
the income tax expense in related to our determination that a valuation allowance should be recorded against all of our deferred tax assets based on the criteria of sfas concerning whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets may not be realized 
in both and  we determined that a valuation allowance should be recorded against all of our deferred tax assets based on the criteria of sfas outlook for we expect revenues for to be similar to and operating losses to be less than those in we are anticipating growth in handsets  driven by our continued penetration of the gsm market 
however  the impact of direct conversion architectures  which reduce the need for some of our products in cdma handsets in  is expected to reduce our revenues by million to million in as compared to we are also anticipating growth in defense related revenues  due to our planned program ramps and the integration of our newly acquired subsidiary  tfr 
base station and broadband revenues are expected to be flat to slightly down and we believe optoelectronics revenues will decrease in as compared to due to discontinued product offerings 
we expect improved profitability in as compared to due to the elimination of certain expenses related to the optoelectronics restructuring announced on november  liquidity and capital resources as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased million to million  from million at december  the net decrease in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities was primarily related to the repurchase of a portion of our subordinated notes million and our capital expenditures million  partially offset by cash provided by operating activities million and the issuance of common stock million 
cash flows provided by operating activities in reflect net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization million and decreases in prepaid expenses and other assets million  inventories million and receivables million  partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses million 
the adjusted net income for was negatively affected by losses from the impairment of assets million  net losses from the sale of assets million and impairment charges from investments in other companies million 
the million of cash provided by operations in represents a million change from the cash used in operating activities during million 
this variance from is primarily related to a net loss adjusted for depreciation and amortization million in and increases in inventories million  receivables million  account payable and accrued expenses million and prepaid expenses million during the adjusted net loss in was primarily due to a non cash lease termination costs million and impairment charges from investments in other companies million  partially offset by a gain on the recovery of a previously impaired investment million 
at december   our net accounts receivable decreased million to million  from million at december  the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in sales during the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of  partially offset by an increase in our days sales outstanding as of december  of days  compared to days as of december  at december   our net inventory balance decreased million to million  from million at december  this decrease is primarily due to decreases in inventory values from our optoelectronics repositioning 
at december   our inventory turnover ratio was times  consistent with december  at december   our assets held for sale balance decreased million to million  from million at december  this decrease is primarily due to a million impairment of our optoelectronics facility we recorded in the fourth quarter of see note to our consolidated financial statements  partially offset by million of net transfers of equipment from property  plant and equipment to held for sale as a result of the optoelectronics restructuring  also in the fourth quarter of see note to our consolidated financial statements 
at december   our net property  plant and equipment balance decreased million to million  from million at december  this decrease is primarily due to current year depreciation expense of million  the transfer of million of assets to held for sale as a result of the optoelectronics restructuring and disposals of equipment of million 
the decrease was partially offset by current year capital expenditures of million 
recent transactions affecting liquidity on may   we completed the repurchase of million face value of our convertible subordinated notes for million before accrued interest 
we regularly evaluate the market pricing of these notes in comparison to our cash flow forecast to determine the value to us of repurchasing a portion of them 
since  we have repurchased million face value of the original million issuance 
on july   we terminated the lease on our wafer fabrication facility located in richardson  texas and took ownership of the facility 
in association with the termination of this lease  we released the million to the financial institution sponsoring the lease and incurred various legal fees associated with the title transfer 
on january   we completed our acquisition of a substantial portion of the optoelectronics business of agere for million in cash plus acquisition costs and certain assumed liabilities 
through a transitional manufacturing agreement  agere supplied components for us for a short period following the close of the transaction to ensure seamless service to customers 
agere also provided some business infrastructure services to us for a short period following the close of the transaction to provide for an uninterrupted transition of the business operations 
sources of liquidity our current cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances  together with cash anticipated to be generated from operations are currently our principal sources of liquidity and we believe these will satisfy our projected working capital  capital expenditure  and possible investment needs  at a minimum  through the next months 
we expect our need for capital expenditures in to be between million and million 
the principal risks to these sources of liquidity would be capital expenditures or investment needs in excess of our expectations  in which case we may be required to finance any additional requirements through additional equity offerings  debt financings or credit facilities 
we may not be able to obtain additional financings or credit facilities  or if these funds are available  they may not be available on satisfactory terms 
other significant cash obligations the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments that will affect our future liquidity as of december  payments due by period in millions total less than year years years after years convertible subordinated notes operating leases capital lease unconditional purchase obligations deferred compensation other obligations total the notes are due on march  and have a fixed interest rate of 
we have repurchased a total of million of the original million obligation in the open market during  and  to reduce our obligation and we may repurchase additional notes in the future

the purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on triquint and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
the amount presented represents the liability for our non qualified deferred compensation plan the plan established in october the plan provides employees who are eligible to participate and the members of the board of directors with the opportunity to defer a specified percentage of their cash compensation 
the deferred earnings are invested at the discretion of each participating employee or director and the deferred compensation we are obligated to deliver is adjusted for increases or decreases in the deferred amount due to such investment 
we include the asset deferred by the participants million in the other noncurrent assets  net line item and our obligation to deliver the deferred compensation in the other long term liabilities line item on our consolidated balance sheet 
the balance represents the pension liability of our german subsidiary million and our termination liability to certain officers if they are terminated for other than cause million 
the pension liability is associated with our german subsidiary  which becomes payable when the covered employees reach the age of or the liability was acquired through our purchase of infineon in we elected to secure the liability through a reinsurance program supported by us 
no individual is eligible within the next five years 
we included the reinsurance receivables million in the other current assets  net line item and our obligation to deliver the pension obligation in the accrued payroll line item on our consolidated balance sheet 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which replaces sfas no 
 supersedes apb no 
 and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flow 
currently  we use the black scholes model for option expense calculation and present pro forma disclosure of the income statement effect in financial statement footnotes only under apb no 
however  under sfas no 
r  pro forma disclosure of the income statement effects of share based payments will no longer be an alternative and all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options will be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
in addition  companies must also recognize compensation expense related to any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date 
compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas r is effective for public companies at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning june  we are currently evaluating our share based employee compensation programs to determine what action  if any  we may make to these programs 
as part of an overall review of our compensation and benefits program we made a number of changes to these programs  including the acceleration of the vesting of options  excluding option grants to our board members and chief executive officer  with an option price equal or greater to per share see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we expect the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our results of operations  however  we have not yet determined the method of adoption  the effect of adopting sfas r  or whether adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 in an effort to converge us accounting standards for inventories with international accounting standards 
fas no 
requires idle facility expenses  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage costs to be recognized as current period charges 
it also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
fas no 
will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we have historically applied these principles to our costing methods and are currently in compliance with the standard 
as such  the standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
on september   the emerging issues task force eitf reached consensus on issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share  which changes the treatment of contingently convertible debt instruments in the calculation of diluted earnings per share 
eitf no 
provides that the shares issuable upon conversion of these debt instruments be included in the earnings per share computation  if dilutive  regardless of whether the contingent conditions for their conversion have been met 
this change does not have any effect on net income  however it may affect the related earnings per share amounts 
eitf no 
will be effective for reporting periods ending after december   however the adoption of eitf no 
is not expected to have an impact on our earnings per share as our outstanding convertible debt is not contingently convertible debt 
in january  the fasb released interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin requires an investor with a majority of the variable interests primary beneficiary in a variable interest entity vie to consolidate the entity and also requires majority and significant variable interest investors to provide certain disclosures 
a vie is an entity in which the voting equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from the other parties 
the provisions of fin no 
were effective immediately for all arrangements entered into with new vies created after january  in december  the fasb published a revision of fin fin r to clarify some of the provisions of fin and to defer the effective date of implementation for certain entities 
under the guidance of fin r  entities that did not have interests in structures that are commonly referred to as special purpose entities are required to apply the provisions of the interpretation in financial statements for periods ending after march  based on the provisions of fin and fin r  we do not have any variable interests in vies  and therefore  fin and fin r has not had an impact on us in fiscal years or impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on operating costs and expenses 
factors that may affect future results an investment in our common stock is extremely risky 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  as well as assumptions that  if they never materialize or prove incorrect  could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such statements reflect management s current expectations  assumptions and estimates of future performance and economic conditions 
such statements are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the following are some of the factors we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose part or all of your investment 
other factors besides those listed here could also adversely affect us 
our operating results may fluctuate substantially  which may cause our stock price to fall 
our quarterly and annual results of operations have varied in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors including  but not limited to  the following cancellation or delay of customer orders or shipments  our success in achieving design wins in which our products are designed into those of our customers  market acceptance of our products and those of our customers  variability of the life cycles of our customers products  variations in manufacturing yields  timing of announcements and introduction of new products by us and our competitors  changes in the mix of products we sell  declining average sales prices for our products  ability to integrate existing and newly developed technologies  changes in manufacturing capacity and variations in the utilization of that capacity  variations in operating expenses  impairments of our assets  the long sales cycles associated with our customer specific products  the timing and level of product and process development costs  availability of materials used in the assembly of our products  performance of vendors and subcontractors  realization of research and development efforts  variations in raw material quality and costs  delays in new process qualification or delays in transferring processes  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor and electronic communications component industries  continued softness in the optical components and networks market  delayed consolidations of the optoelectronics industry  continuing a state of the industry oversupply and pricing below acceptable margins  the timing and level of nonrecurring engineering revenues and expenses relating to customer specific products  our ability to successfully integrate the operations of acquired businesses and to retain the customers of acquired businesses  significantly higher costs associated with integrating the operations of acquired businesses than we anticipated  significant changes in our and our customers inventory levels  longer payment terms  and delivery terms requiring that we cover shipment and insurance costs as well as request that we cover duty costs 
we expect that our operating results will continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of these and other factors 
any unfavorable changes in these or other factors could cause our results of operations to suffer as they have in the past 
due to potential fluctuations  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of our future performance 
additionally  if our operating results are not within the market s expectations  then our stock price may fall 
the public stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility  particularly in high technology sectors of the market 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to or disproportionately impacted by the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
new competitive products and technologies have been announced which could reduce demand for our saw filter products and our receiver and related products for wireless phones 
new products have been introduced in the marketplace that use a direct conversion architecture in wireless phones  which reduces the number of components needed in the receiver portion of wireless phones 
sales of our saw if filter products along with some of our receiver products would be negatively impacted by wireless phone manufacturers use of a direct conversion chipset as new phone models are developed 
direct conversion architecture has been available since the mid s for gsm phones and wireless phone manufacturers are increasing the use of this process in new phones 
in and  sales of saw if filters and receiver products for gsm phones accounted for less than of our total revenues 
in addition  several companies have introduced a direct conversion chipset for cdma phones which will impact our future revenues from saw if filters and receiver products for cdma phones 
in and  sales from saw if filters for cdma phones were approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues and sales of receiver and related products for cdma phones were approximately and of our total revenues  respectively 
further  we continue to sell products for tdma wireless phones  which are increasingly migrating to the gsm standard 
our sales of products for tdma phones for year ended december  was less than of our total revenue as compared to approximately of our total revenue for in  we are anticipating this conversion for all standards to have a negative impact on our saw filter revenue in certain applications of million to million as compared to other competitive filtering technologies  including film bulk acoustic resonator fbar and bulk acoustic wave baw  have been introduced and have gained market acceptance in certain applications 
we are actively pursuing new products such as rf filters  duplexers  power amplifiers  modules and baw filtering to offset the decline in sales of products affected by direct conversion architecture and the loss of revenues from products for tdma phones 
if we are not successful in introducing competitive or alternative products  our business  financial condition and results of operation will suffer 
our operating results may suffer due to fluctuations in demand for semiconductors and electronic communications components 
from time to time  the wireless phone  infrastructure networks  optical networks  and defense markets have experienced significant downturns and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles  capital spending cycles and declines in general economic conditions 
this cyclical nature of these markets has led to significant imbalances in demand  inventory levels and production capacity 
it has also accelerated the decrease of average selling prices per unit 
we have experienced  and may experience again  periodic fluctuations in our financial results because of these or other industry wide conditions 
for example  if demand for communications applications were to decrease substantially  demand for the integrated circuits and modules  optical components and modules and saw filter components in these applications would also decline  which would negatively affect our operating results 
conversely  we believe that current trends such as wireless phone portability  color screens and digital photo capability  and the development of wireless infrastructure in countries such as india and china will increase the demand for our products 
we do not know  however  if this will lead to a sustained level of increased demand 
we depend on the continued growth of communications markets 
we derive all of our product revenues from sales of products and services for electronic communication applications 
these markets are characterized by the following cyclical demand  intense competition  rapid technological change  and short product life cycles  especially in the wireless phone market 
the electronic communications markets recovered some of their previous pattern of growth during the first half of  however the markets softened during the third quarter 
these markets may not resume historical growth rates and if the current market softness continues and demand for electronic communications applications declines  our operating results could suffer 
products for electronic communications applications are often based on industry standards  which are continually evolving 
our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products based on emerging industry standards  which could render our existing products unmarketable or obsolete 
if communications markets evolve to new standards  we may be unable to successfully design and manufacture new products that address the needs of our customers or that will meet with substantial market acceptance 
our financial statements will have a significant material adverse charge when we are required to expense share based payment to employees 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which replaces sfas no 
 supersedes apb no 
 and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flow 
currently  we use the black scholes model for option expense calculation and present pro forma disclosure of the income statement effect in financial statement footnotes only under apb no 
however  under sfas no 
r  pro forma disclosure of the income statement effects of share based payments will no longer an alternative and all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options will be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
in addition  companies must also recognize compensation expense related to any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date 
compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas r is effective for public companies at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning june  we are currently evaluating our share based employee compensation programs to determine what action  if any  may be required to reduce this potential charge when this statement becomes effective 
in anticipation of the effective date  we have accelerated the vesting of options  excluding option grants to our board members and chief executive officer  with an option price equal or greater to per share 
the adoption of the standard is expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial statements 
in the event we are unable to satisfy regulatory requirements relating to internal controls  or if these internal controls over financial reporting are not effective  our business and our stock price could suffer 
section of sarbanes oxley requires companies to do a comprehensive and costly evaluation of their internal controls 
as a result  during  we were required to perform an evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting and have our auditor publicly attest to such evaluation 
at december   management asserted  and our auditors attested  that we had no material weaknesses over internal controls over financial reporting and were in full compliance of section our efforts to comply with section and related regulations regarding our management s required assessment of internal control over financial reporting and our independent auditors attestation of that assessment has required  and continues to require  the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
while we anticipate maintaining the integrity of our internal controls over financial reporting and all other aspects of section  we cannot be certain that a material weakness will not arise 
if a material weakness is discovered  we could be subject to regulatory investigations or sanctions  costly litigation or a loss of public confidence in our internal controls  which could have an adverse effect on our business and our stock price 
our revenues are at risk if we do not introduce new products and or decrease costs 
historically  the average selling prices of our products have decreased over the products lives and we expect them to continue to do so 
to offset these decreases  we rely primarily on achieving yield improvements and other cost reductions for existing products and on introducing new products that can be manufactured at lower costs 
selling prices for our saw products have declined due to competitive pricing pressures and to the use of newer surface mount package devices that are smaller and less expensive than previous generation filters 
for example  we have experienced declines in average selling prices for rf filters for wireless phones due to competitive pressure and for filters for base stations due to the use of surface mount packages 
we believe our future success depends  in part  on our timely development and introduction of new products that compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and adequately address customer requirements 
the success of new product and process introductions depends on several factors  including proper selection of products and processes  successful and timely completion of product and process development and commercialization  market acceptance of our or our customers new products  achievement of acceptable manufacturing yields  our ability to offer new products at competitive prices  and managing the cost of raw materials and manufacturing services 
our product and process development efforts may not be successful and our new products or processes may not achieve market acceptance 
to the extent that our cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner  our results of operations could suffer 
our business could be harmed if systems manufacturers do not use components made of gaas or other alternative materials we utilize 
silicon semiconductor technologies are the dominant process technologies for integrated circuits and the performance of silicon integrated circuits continues to improve 
system designers may be reluctant to adopt our products because of their unfamiliarity with designing systems with our products  their concerns related to manufacturing costs and yields  their unfamiliarity with our design and manufacturing processes  and uncertainties about the relative cost effectiveness of our products compared to high performance silicon components 
systems manufacturers may not use gaas components because the production of gaas integrated circuits has been  and continues to be  more costly than the production of silicon devices 
systems manufacturers may also be reluctant to rely on a jointly produced product because future supplies may depend on our continued good relationships with those vendors 
as a result  we must offer devices that provide superior performance to that of traditional silicon based devices 
in addition  customers may be reluctant to rely on a smaller company like us for critical components 
we cannot be certain that additional systems manufacturers will design our products into their systems or that the companies that have utilized our products will continue to do so in the future 
if our products fail to achieve market acceptance  our results of operations would suffer 
a decline in the growth of wireless communications or in the continued acceptance of cdma technology  particularly in emerging markets  would have an adverse impact on us 
our products for cdma based systems  including filters for base stations and receivers and power amplifiers for wireless phones comprise a significant part of our business 
cdma technology is relatively expensive and there can be no assurance that emerging markets  such as china and india  will continue to adopt this technology 
our business and financial results would be adversely impacted if cdma technology does not continue to gain acceptance or if demand does not strengthen 
our business may be adversely impacted if we fail to successfully introduce new products or to gain our customers acceptance of those new products 
the markets for electronic communications applications in which we participate are subject to intense competition  rapid technological change  and short product life cycles 
it is critical for companies such as ours to continually and quickly develop new products to meet the changing needs of these markets 
if we fail to develop new products to meet our customers needs on a timely basis  we will not be able to effectively compete in these markets 
for example  we announced our intention to develop and market rf front end modules for wireless phones at cost effective prices 
we will also need to continue to expand our wireless applications into cdma and gsm applications 
if we fail to design and produce these products in a manner acceptable to our customers or have incorrectly anticipated our customers demand for these types of products  our operating results could be harmed 
our business will be adversely impacted if we do not continue to gain market acceptance of our wireless phone module products or develop effective manufacturing processes to produce them 
our strategy for wireless phone products depends in large part upon the success of our design and marketing of wireless phone modules 
wireless phone modules represent the incorporation of some or all of the components of the wireless phone radio into a single product 
if we are unable to design these modules in a manner acceptable to our customers or have incorrectly anticipated our customers demand for these products  our operating results will be adversely affected 
manufacturing module products represents a departure from our traditional component manufacturing business 
production of module products entails different processes  costs  yields  and lead times 
if we fail to successfully transition manufacturing resources to produce these products or are unable to do so cost effectively  our operating results will be adversely affected 
our current experience is that increased module sales are having a negative impact on gross margins 
if we are unable to reduce the costs of producing modules  total gross margin will decrease as the proportion of module sales increase 
if we fail to sell a high volume of products  our operating results will be harmed 
because large portions of our manufacturing costs are relatively fixed  our manufacturing volumes are critical to our operating results 
if we fail to achieve acceptable manufacturing volumes or experience product shipment delays  our results of operations could be harmed 
during periods of decreased demand  our high fixed manufacturing costs negatively affect our results of operations 
we base our expense levels in part on our expectations of future orders and these expense levels are predominantly fixed in the short term 
however  if the rate of growth of demand decreases  we will not be able to grow our revenue 
if we receive fewer customer orders than expected or if our customers delay or cancel orders  we may not be able to reduce our manufacturing costs in the short term and our operating results would be harmed 
in addition  we are selling products to an increasing number of our customers on a consignment basis  which can limit our ability to forecast revenues 
if we do not sell our customer specific products in large volumes  our operating results may be harmed 
we manufacture a substantial portion of our products to address the needs of individual customers 
frequent product introductions by systems manufacturers make our future success dependent on our ability to select development projects which will result in sufficient volumes to enable us to achieve manufacturing efficiencies 
because customer specific products are developed for unique applications  we expect that some of our current and future customer specific products may never be produced in sufficient volume and may impair our ability to cover our fixed manufacturing costs 
furthermore  if customers cancel or delay orders for these customer specific products  our inventory of these products may become unmarketable or obsolete  which would negatively affect our operating results 
in addition  if we experience delays in completing designs  fail to obtain development contracts from customers whose products are successful  or fail to have our product designed into the next generation product of existing volume production customers  our revenues could be harmed 
our excess manufacturing capacity may adversely affect our operating results if current market softness does not improve and if we are unable to sell our assets held for sale 
we have converted our hillsboro facility from four inch wafer production to six inch wafer production and have expanded the capacity of our texas operation with the acquisition of the richardson facility 
in addition  we have acquired additional manufacturing facilities and personnel in connection with our acquisition of businesses from infineon and agere 
however  in the first quarter of  we entered into an agreement to sell our breinigsville  pennsylvania facility to a real estate investment firm and lease back approximately  square feet of the  square foot facility to reduce excess manufacturing capacity see note to our consolidated financial statements 
these increases in capacity directly relate to significant increases in fixed costs and operating expenses 
these increased costs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations during economic downturns 
if the current market softness does not improve  and if we are unable to successfully complete the sale of our pennsylvania facility and  to sell excess equipment associated with our manufacturing operations in pennsylvania  texas and oregon  the decreased levels of demand and production in conjunction with these increased expense levels will have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face challenges and risks associated with our acquisition of tfr technologies  inc and  as a result  may not realize the expected benefit of this acquisition 
on january   we completed the acquisition of tfr technologies  inc  tfr  a manufacturer and developer of thin film resonator filters for communication applications using bulk acoustic wave baw or film bulk acoustic resonator fbar technology 
we face risks associated with this acquisition such as our ability to develop new products and generate new design wins  our ability to retain the employees and to integrate them into our corporate culture  our ability to retain existing partners and customers of this business  our ability to cost effectively develop commercial products using baw technology  and our ability to successfully integrate the baw applications into our products 
if investors or financial or industry analysts do not think the integration of our acquisitions is proceeding as anticipated or that the benefits of the acquisitions may not be realized  the market price of our common stock may decline 
the market price of our common stock may decline if the integration of our acquisitions is not completed in a timely and efficient manner  our assumptions about the business models and operations of the acquired businesses were incorrect or their role in our business does not develop as we planned  we are unable to introduce new products incorporating acquired technology  the effect of the acquisitions on our financial results is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts  or following the acquisitions  our stockholders that hold relatively larger interests in our company may decide to dispose of their shares because the results of the acquisitions are not consistent with their expectations 
we face risks of a loss of revenues as we are dependent on us government and military contracts for a portion of our revenues 
while the us government and military programs we are involved in generally have long lead times such as the f and b aircraft programs  they are also subject to delays or cancellation 
additionally  changes in government funding for defense or the loss of a significant defense program or contract would have a material adverse impact on our company 
in and  we received approximately of our revenues from the us government or from prime contractors on us government sponsored programs principally for defense applications 
further  spending on defense contracts can vary significantly depending on funding from the us government 
during  our government and military contracts were negatively impacted by the war in iraq as the government allocated more business to funding the war and less on new development and long term programs  such as the ones we are dependent upon 
we face risks from failures in our manufacturing processes  the maintenance of our fabrication facilities and the processes of our vendors 
the fabrication of integrated circuits  particularly those made of gaas  is a highly complex and precise process 
our integrated circuits are currently manufactured on wafers made of gaas  inp  and linbo our saw filters are currently manufactured primarily on linbo  litao and quartz wafers 
during manufacturing  each wafer is processed to contain numerous integrated circuits or saw filters 
we may reject or be unable to sell a substantial percentage of wafers or the components on a given wafer because of minute impurities  difficulties in the fabrication process  such as failure of special equipment  operator error or power outages  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer  electrical and or optical performance  wafer breakage  or other factors 
we refer to the proportion of final components that have been processed  assembled and tested relative to the gross number of components that could be constructed from the raw materials as our manufacturing yield 
compared to the manufacture of silicon integrated circuits  gaas technology is less mature and more difficult to design and manufacture within specifications in large volume 
in addition  the more brittle nature of gaas wafers can result in lower manufacturing yields than with silicon wafers 
we have in the past experienced lower than expected manufacturing yields  which have delayed product shipments and negatively impacted our results of operations 
we may experience difficulty maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields in the future 
in addition  the maintenance of our fabrication facilities and our assembly facilities is subject to risks  including the demands of managing and coordinating workflow between geographically separate production facilities  disruption of production in one of our facilities as a result of a slowdown or shutdown in our other facility  and higher operating costs from managing geographically separate manufacturing facilities 
we depend on certain vendors for components  equipment and services 
we maintain stringent policies regarding qualification of these vendors 
however  if these vendors processes vary in reliability or quality  they could negatively affect our products  and thereby  our results of operations 
we face risks from an increasing proportion of our operations and employees being located outside of the us as we continue to expand our operations  an increasing number of our employees and operations are located in countries other than the us the laws and governance of these countries may differ substantially from that of the us and may expose us to increased risks of adverse impacts on our operations and results of operations 
these risks could include loss of protection of proprietary technology  disruption of production processes  interruption of freight channels and delivery schedules  currency exposure  financial institution failure  government expropriation  labor shortages  political unrest  and fraud 
some of our manufacturing facilities are located in areas prone to natural disasters 
we have a saw manufacturing and assembly facility located in apopka  florida 
we also have assembly facilities for saw products in san jose  costa rica and for optoelectronics products in matamoros  mexico 
hurricanes  tropical storms  flooding  tornadoes  and other natural disasters are common events for the southeastern and gulf of mexico regions of the us and in central america which could affect our operations in these areas 
additionally  mud slides  earthquakes and volcanic eruptions could also affect our costa rican and oregon facilities 
any disruptions from these or other events would have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results 
although we have manufacturing and assembly capabilities for our sawtek products in both apopka  florida and san jose  costa rica  we are only capable of fabricating wafers for those products in our apopka facility and rely on our san jose facility for the majority of our assembly operations 
as a result  any disruption to either facility would have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results 
the hurricanes encountered in the southeastern us during the third quarter of did not cause any significant damage to our facilities 
the following table indicates the approximate exposure we believe we have with respect to natural disasters type of approximate percent of total location disaster fixed assets revenues apopka  florida h dallas  texas h hillsboro  oregon e  v matamoros  mexico h under san jose  costa rica e  v  h e earthquake mudslide v volcanic eruption h hurricane and or tornado and flooding figures are based on revenues for the year ended december  or fixed assets as of december  additionally  the sum may be greater than due to shared risks between locations 
a disruption in our costa rican or mexican operations would have an adverse impact on our operating results 
operating facilities in costa rica and mexico presents risks of disruption such as government intervention  currency fluctuations  labor disputes  limited supplies of labor  power interruption  civil unrest  or war 
any such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our costa rican operations have been a significant contributor to our operating results in the past 
we expect our costa rican operations to continue to account for a significant proportion of our saw operations in the future and our mexican operation to be an important part of our optoelectronics component business 
any disruption in these operations would have a significant negative impact on our operating results 
we face risks from changes in tax regulations and a change in our costa rican subsidiary s favorable tax status would have an adverse impact on our operating results 
we are subject to taxation in many different countries and localities worldwide 
in some jurisdictions  we have employed specific business strategies to minimize our tax exposure 
to the extent the tax laws and regulations in these various countries and localities could change  our tax liability in general could increase or our tax saving strategies could be threatened 
such changes could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results 
for example  our subsidiary in costa rica operates in a free trade zone 
we expect to receive a exemption from costa rican income taxes through the costa rican government continues to review its policy on granting tax exemptions to companies located in free trade zones and it may change our tax status or minimize our benefit at any time 
any adverse change in the tax structure for our costa rican subsidiary made by the costa rican government would have a negative impact on our net income 
in  the tax exemption reduced our income tax expense by million 
in addition  the us internal revenue service could assert additional taxes associated with our subsidiary due to differing interpretations of transfer pricing and other intercompany transactions 
our business may be adversely affected by acts of terrorism or war 
acts of terrorism or war could interrupt or restrict our business in several ways 
we rely extensively on the use of air transportation to move our inventory to and from our vendors and to ship finished products to our customers 
if war or terrorist acts cause air transportation to be grounded or severely interrupted  our business would be similarly adversely impacted 
in addition  war or acts of terrorism could cause existing export regulations to be changed  which could limit the extent to which we are allowed to export our products 
to the extent that war or acts of terrorism also reduce customer confidence and create general economic weakness  our business would also be adversely affected 
a widespread outbreak of an infectious disease or illness could negatively affect our marketing  assembly and test  design  or other operations  making it more difficult and expensive to meet our obligations to our customers and could result in reduced demand from our customers 
a widespread outbreak of an infectious disease or illness could adversely affect our operations as well as demand from our customers 
a number of countries in the asia pacific region have experienced outbreaks of different infectious diseases and illnesses in the past and the us has reported a current shortage in the influenza vaccine 
as a result of widespread outbreaks  businesses can be temporarily affected and individuals can become ill or quarantined 
our operating results could be harmed if we lose access to sole or limited sources of materials  equipment or services 
we currently obtain some components  equipment and services for our products from limited or single sources  such as certain ceramic packages and chemicals 
approximately of our purchases are from sole sources 
we purchase these components  equipment  supplies and services on a purchase order basis  do not carry significant inventories and generally do not have long term supply contracts with these vendors 
our requirements are relatively small compared to silicon semiconductor manufacturers 
because we often do not account for a significant part of our vendors business  we may not have access to sufficient capacity from these vendors in periods of high demand 
if we were to change any of our sole or limited source vendors  we would be required to requalify each new vendor 
requalification could prevent or delay product shipments  which could negatively affect our results of operations 
in some cases  it would be difficult to replace these suppliers and requalification could take up to months 
our reliance on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials and parts may impair our ability to produce our products on time and in acceptable yields 
for example  at times in the past  we have experienced difficulties in obtaining ceramic packages and lids used in the production of bandpass filters 
at other times  the acquisition of relatively simple devices  such as capacitors  has been problematic because of the large demand swings that can occur in the cellular handset market for such components 
our optical components group is dependent upon a large number of suppliers  some of which are very small companies  for components that make up their components and sub system product offerings such as transceivers 
the success of these products is critical to the overall success of our business 
the primary risk to our source of supply to manufacture these products is the currently depressed state of the optical network market and its potential impact on smaller vendors in terms of possible bankruptcy or inability to meet delivery schedules 
in addition  our reliance on these vendors may negatively affect our production if the components  equipment or services vary in reliability or quality 
if we are unable to obtain timely deliveries of sufficient quantities of acceptable quality or if the prices increase  our results of operations could be harmed 
our operating results could be harmed if our subcontractors and partners are unable to fulfill our requirements 
we currently utilize subcontractors for the majority of our integrated circuit and module assemblies 
approximately of our revenue is derived from components in which we utilize subcontractors for some portion of the production process 
there are certain risks associated with dependence on third party providers  such as minimal control over delivery scheduling  adequate capacity during demand peaks  warranty issues and protection of intellectual property 
additionally  if these subcontractors are unable to meet our needs  it could prevent or delay production shipments that could negatively affect our results of operations 
if we were to change any of our subcontractors  we would be required to requalify each new subcontractor  which could also prevent or delay product shipments that could negatively affect our results of operations 
in addition  our reliance on these subcontractors may negatively affect our production if the services vary in reliability or quality 
if we are unable to obtain timely service of acceptable quality or if the prices increase  our results of operations could be harmed 
if our products fail to perform or meet customer requirements  we could incur significant additional costs 
the fabrication of integrated circuits and saw filters from substrate materials such and the modules containing these components is a highly complex and precise process 
our customers specify quality  performance and reliability standards that we must meet 
if our products do not meet these standards  we may be required to rework or replace the products 
our products may contain undetected defects or failures that only become evident after we commence volume shipments 
we have experienced product quality  performance or reliability problems from time to time 
we are currently experiencing field failures and returns on some components and are collecting data for analysis and evaluation as to the extent of the problem 
other defects or failures may also occur in the future 
if failures or defects occur  we could lose revenues  incur increased costs such as warranty expense and costs associated with customer support  experience delays  cancellations or rescheduling of orders for our products  or experience increased product returns or discounts 
we may face fines or our facilities could be closed if we fail to comply with environmental regulations 
federal  state and local regulations impose various environmental controls on the storage  handling  discharge and disposal of chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing process 
for our manufacturing facilities  we generally provide our own manufacturing waste treatment and contract for disposal of some materials 
we are required to report usage of environmentally hazardous materials 
the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us and we could be required to suspend production or cease our operations 
these regulations could require us to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
any failure by us to control the use of  or to adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities and harm our results of operations 
further  new environmental initiatives could affect the materials we currently use in production 
we have substantial indebtedness 
we have million of indebtedness remaining in the form of our convertible subordinated notes due in we have additional indebtedness for operating and capital leases 
we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
the level of our indebtedness  among other things  could make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness  which would reduce the amount of our expected cash flow available for other purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures  limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to  changes in our business  and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our debt service obligations  including our obligation under the notes 
we may not be able to pay our debt and other obligations 
if our cash flow is inadequate to meet our obligations  we could face substantial liquidity problems 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the notes or our other obligations  we would be in default under the terms thereof 
default under the indenture would permit the holders of the notes to accelerate the maturity of the notes and could cause defaults under future indebtedness we may incur 
any such default could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  we can not assure you that we would be able to repay amounts due in respect of the notes if payment of the notes were to be accelerated following the occurrence of an event of default as defined in the indenture 
customers may delay or cancel orders due to regulatory delays 
the increasing significance of electronic communications products has increased pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards for electronic communications  generally following extensive investigation of and deliberation over competing technologies 
the delays inherent in the regulatory approval process may in the future cause the cancellation  postponement or rescheduling of the installation of communications systems by our customers 
these delays have in the past had  and may in the future have  a negative effect on our sales and our results of operations 
we must improve our products and processes to remain competitive 
if technologies or standards supported by our or our customers products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance  our results of operations may be materially impacted 
because of continual improvements in semiconductor technology  including those in high performance silicon technologies such as cmos  where substantially more resources are invested than in other technologies such as gaas or saw products  we believe that our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to improve our product and process technologies 
we must also develop new technologies in a timely manner 
in addition  we must adapt our products and processes to technological changes and to support emerging and established industry standards 
we have and must continue to perform significant research and development into advanced material development such as inp  gallium nitride gan  and silicon carbide sic to compete with future technologies of our competitors 
these research and development efforts may not be accepted by our customers  and therefore may not achieve sustained production in the future 
we may not be able to improve our existing products and process technologies  develop new technologies in a timely manner or effectively support industry standards 
if we fail to do so  our customers may select another gaas or saw product or move to an alternative technology 
our results of operations may suffer if we do not compete successfully 
the markets for our products are characterized by price competition  rapid technological change  short product life cycles  and heightened global competition 
many of our competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing and marketing resources 
due to the increasing requirements for high speed  high frequency components  we expect intensified competition from existing integrated circuit and saw device suppliers  as well as from the entry of new competitors to our target markets and from the internal operations of some companies producing products similar to ours for their internal requirements 
several key customers in the optoelectronics market have either captive internal suppliers or long term contractual relationships with suppliers based on factors other than cost and quality 
for products in depressed or flat markets  such as for optical components  competition can be even more intense as companies attempt to maximize their revenue to cover as much of their fixed cost base as possible  even if it means selling products at a loss 
there is no guarantee that pricing will stay at a level where we can sell our products on a profitable basis 
for our integrated circuit devices  we compete primarily with both manufacturers of high performance silicon integrated circuits as well as manufacturers of gaas integrated circuits 
our silicon based competitors include companies such as applied micro circuits corporation  maxim integrated products inc  motorola  philips  stmicroelectronics n 
v and others 
our gaas based competitors include companies such as anadigics inc  eudyna  inc  raytheon  rf micro devices  skyworks solutions  inc  vitesse semiconductor corp 
and others 
for our saw devices our competitors include companies such as ics  phonon  rf monolithics  vectron  epcos ag  temex  tst  fujitsu microelectronics  inc  murata  panasonic and others 
our major competitors across the optical markets include jds uniphase  bookham technologies  avanex  eudyna  opnext  mitsubishi  sumitomo and others 
competition could also come from companies ahead of us in developing alternative technologies such as silicon germanium sige and inp integrated circuits and digital filtering and direct conversion devices 
competition from existing or potential competitors may increase due to a number of factors including  but not limited to  the following offering of new or emerging technologies in integrated circuit or optical component design using alternative materials such as inp  offering of new or emerging technologies such as digital filtering  baw or direct conversion as alternatives to saw filters  mergers and acquisitions of our customers by our competitors or other entities  longer operating histories and presence in key markets  development of strategic relationships between our competitors  ability to obtain raw materials at lower costs due to larger purchasing volumes or other advantageous supply relationships  access to a wider customer base  and access to greater financial  technical  manufacturing and marketing resources 
additionally  manufacturers of high performance silicon integrated circuits have achieved greater market acceptance of their existing products and technologies in some applications 
we compete with both gaas and silicon suppliers in all of our target markets 
in microwave and millimeter wave applications  our competition is primarily from a limited number of gaas suppliers  which are in the process of expanding their product offerings to address commercial applications other than aerospace 
we currently have excess capacity in our gaas fabrication plants and are in the process of evaluating the carrying value of these facilities  which may result in a potential impairment charge 
competition is primarily based on performance elements such as speed  complexity and power dissipation  as well as price  product quality and ability to deliver products in a timely fashion 
due to the proprietary nature of our products  competition occurs almost exclusively at the system design stage 
as a result  a design win by our competitors or by us typically limits further competition with respect to manufacturing a given design 
if we fail to integrate any future acquisitions  such as tfr technologies  inc  or successfully invest in privately held companies  our business will be harmed 
we face risks from any future acquisitions  including the following we may fail to merge and coordinate the operations and personnel of newly acquired companies with our existing business  we may fail to retain the key employees required to make the operation successful  additional complexity may affect our flexibility and ability to respond quickly to market and management issues  we may experience difficulties integrating our financial and operating systems  we may experience additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning  treasury management  financial reporting and risk management  our ongoing business may be disrupted or receive insufficient management attention  we may not cost effectively and rapidly incorporate the technologies we acquire  we may not be able to cost effectively develop commercial products using the newly acquired technology  including the new acquired baw technology used in military applications  we may not be able to recognize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated  we may not be able to retain the existing customers of newly acquired operations  existing customers of the acquired operations may demand significant price reductions or other detrimental term changes as a result of the change in ownership  our corporate culture may clash with that of the acquired businesses  we may incur unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses  and our increasing international presence resulting from acquisitions increases our exposure to foreign political  currency  and tax risks 
we face risks from equity investments in privately held companies  such as we may not realize the expected benefits associated with the investment resulting in a partial or total write off of this investment  we may need to provide additional funding to support the privately held company  or if their value decreases  we may realize losses on our holdings 
we may not successfully address these risks or any other problems that arise in connection with future acquisitions or equity investments in privately held companies 
we will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities available to us and we may pursue product  technology or business acquisitions or investments in strategic partners 
in addition  in connection with any future acquisitions  we may issue equity securities that could dilute the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders  we may incur additional debt and we may be required to amortize expenses related to other intangible assets or record impairment of goodwill that may negatively affect our results of operations 
if we do not hire and retain key employees  our business will suffer our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical  marketing and management personnel 
we also depend on our ability to continue to identify  attract and retain qualified technical employees  particularly highly skilled design  process and test engineers involved in the manufacture and development of our products and processes 
we must also recruit and train employees to manufacture our products without a substantial reduction in manufacturing yields 
there are many other semiconductor companies located in the communities near our facilities and  as the economy improves  it may become increasingly difficult for us to attract and retain those employees 
the competition for key employees is intense  and the loss of key employees could negatively affect us 
only four employees have employment agreements  our chief executive officer  chief financial officer  vice president of sales and the founder of tfr technologies  inc tfr  a company acquired on january  the founder of tfr is the only individual for whom we currently have key man life insurance in place 
our business may be harmed if we fail to protect our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights 
we currently have patents granted and pending in the us and elsewhere and intend to seek further international and us patents on our technology 
in addition to our own inventions  we have acquired a substantial portfolio of us and foreign patent applications in the optoelectronics area of technology 
many of these patent applications have issued as patents and will have lives that will extend years from their respective filing dates  while other are still pending 
we cannot be certain that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications or that patents will be issued in all countries where our products can be sold or that any claims allowed from pending applications or will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage 
our competitors may also be able to design around our patents 
the laws of some countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us  increasing the possibility of piracy of our technology and products 
although we intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights  we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology 
our competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
our involvement in any patent dispute or other intellectual property dispute or action to protect trade secrets and know how could have a material adverse effect on our business 
adverse determinations in any litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require us to seek licenses from third parties and prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products 
any of these situations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have approximately patents that expire from to  with most expiring between and we currently do not have any significant revenue related to a patent that will soon expire 
our ability to produce our products may suffer if someone claims we infringe on their intellectual property 
the integrated circuit and saw device industries are characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions  which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
if it is necessary or desirable  we may seek licenses under such patents or other intellectual property rights 
however  we cannot be certain that licenses will be offered or that we would find the terms of licenses that are offered acceptable or commercially reasonable 
our failure to obtain a license from a third party for technology used by us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture of products 
furthermore  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
litigation by or against us could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our technical personnel and management  whether or not the litigation results in a favorable determination 
in the event of an adverse result in any litigation  we could be required to pay substantial damages  indemnify our customers  stop the manufacture  use and sale of the infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue the use of certain processes  or obtain licenses to the technology 
we may be unsuccessful in developing non infringing products or negotiating licenses upon reasonable terms  or at all 
these problems might not be resolved in time to avoid harming our results of operations 
if any third party makes a successful claim against our customers or us and a license is not made available to us on commercially reasonable terms  our business could be harmed 
our ability to accurately predict revenues could deteriorate if we generate additional sales through inventory hubbing distribution facilities 
several of our larger customers have requested that we send our products to independent warehouses known as inventory hubbing distribution facilities to assist them in inventory control 
we do not recognize revenues from these hubbing arrangements until the customer takes delivery of the inventory and title of the goods passes to the customer 
as a result  increased shipments to these facilities make it more difficult for us to predict short term revenues as customers can take delivery of the products with little lead time 
our business may suffer due to risks associated with international sales 
our sales outside of the us comprised approximately and of revenues during and  respectively 
as a result  we face inherent risks from these sales  including imposition of government controls  currency exchange fluctuations  longer payment cycles and difficulties related to the collection of receivables from international customers  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  unfavorable tax consequences  difficulty obtaining distribution and support  political instability  and tariffs and other trade barriers 
in addition  due to the technological advantages provided by gaas integrated circuits in many military applications  the office of export administration of the us department of commerce must license all of our sales outside of north america 
we are also required to obtain licenses from that agency for sales of our saw products to customers in certain countries 
if we fail to obtain these licenses or experience delays in obtaining these licenses in the future  our results of operations could be harmed 
also  because a majority of our foreign sales are denominated in us dollars  increases in the value of the dollar would increase the price in local currencies of our products and make our products less price competitive 
we may be subject to a securities class action suit if our stock price falls 
following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s stock  some stockholders may file securities class action litigation 
for example  in  a stockholder class action lawsuit was filed against us  our underwriters and some of our officers  directors and investors  which alleged that we  our underwriters and certain of our officers  directors and investors intentionally misled the investing public regarding our financial prospects 
we settled the action and recorded a special charge of million associated with the settlement of this lawsuit and related legal expenses  net of accruals  in in february  several nearly identical putative civil class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district court for the middle district of florida against sawtek  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary since july the lawsuits also named as defendants current and former officers of sawtek and our company 
the cases were consolidated into one action  and an amended complaint was filed in this action on july  the amended class action complaint is purportedly filed on behalf of purchasers of sawtek s stock between january and may   and alleges that the defendants violated sections b and a of the securities exchange act  as well as securities and exchange commission rule b  by making false and misleading statements and or omissions to inflate sawtek s stock price and conceal the downward trend in revenues disclosed in sawtek s may  press release 
the complaint does not specify the amount of monetary damages sought 
sawtek and the individual defendants filed their motion to dismiss on september   and briefing on the motion was completed on november  the court heard oral argument on november   and issued an order partially denying the motion to dismiss on december  specifically  the court found that the complaint was not barred by the statute of limitations  but reserved ruling on the other aspects of the motion to dismiss 
because the statute of limitations issue is a novel question of law  the court stayed the proceedings in this case to allow the defendants to file an interlocutory appeal to the eleventh circuit court of appeals 
defendants duly filed for interlocutory appeal on january  because the court of appeals is considering the identical issue in another matter  the appeal process has been stayed  pending the court of appeals decision in the other matter 
we deny the allegations contained in the complaint and intend to continue our vigorous defense against these claims 
this litigation may  however  require us to spend a substantial amount of time and money and could distract management from our day to day operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance as to our success in defending ourselves against these charges 
this and any future securities class action litigation could be expensive and divert our management s attention and harm our business  regardless of its merits 
our stock will likely be subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control and may prevent our stockholders from reselling our common stock at a profit 
the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of the securities of semiconductor companies have been especially volatile 
the market price of our common stock may experience significant fluctuations in the future 
for example  our common stock price has fluctuated from a high of approximately to a low of approximately during the fiscal year ended december  this market volatility  as well as general economic  market or political conditions could reduce the market price of our common stock in spite of our operating performance 
in addition  our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  and in response  the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include anti takeover provisions  which may deter or prevent a takeover attempt 
some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of delaware law may deter or prevent a takeover attempt  including a takeover that might result in a premium over the market price for our common stock 
these provisions include cumulative voting 
our stockholders are entitled to cumulate their votes for directors 
stockholder proposals and nominations 
our stockholders must give advance notice  generally days prior to the relevant meeting  to nominate a candidate for director or present a proposal to our stockholders at a meeting 
these notice requirements could inhibit a takeover by delaying stockholder action 
stockholder rights plan 
we may trigger our stockholder rights plan in the event our board of directors does not agree to an acquisition proposal 
the rights plan may make it more difficult and costly to acquire our company 
preferred stock 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock and to determine what rights  preferences and privileges such shares have 
no action by our stockholders is necessary before our board of directors can issue the preferred stock 
our board of directors could use the preferred stock to make it more difficult and costly to acquire our company 
delaware anti takeover statute 
the delaware anti takeover law restricts business combinations with some stockholders once the stockholder acquires or more of our common stock 
the delaware statute makes it harder for our company to be acquired without the consent of our board of directors and management 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk cash equivalents  short term and long term investments our investments in cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments are classified as available for sale securities and are comprised of highly rated  short and long term investments  such as us government agencies  corporate debt securities  commercial paper and other such low risk investments  in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
all of these investments are held at fair value 
although we manage investments under an investment policy  economic  market and other events may occur which we cannot control 
although the risks are minimal  fixed rate securities may have their fair value adversely impacted because of changes in interest rates and credit ratings 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations because of changes in interest rates or we may suffer principal losses if we were to sell securities that have declined in value because of changes in interest rates or issuer credit ratings 
we do not hold or issue derivatives  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading speculative purposes 
we do not believe that our results of operations would be materially impacted by an immediate change in interest rates 
debt our convertible subordinated notes due in have a fixed interest rate of 
consequently  we do not have significant interest rate cash flow exposure on our long term debt 
however  the fair value of the convertible subordinated notes is subject to significant fluctuations due to their convertibility into shares of our stock and other market conditions 
the fair value of these convertible subordinated notes is also sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of the us interest rates 
we would be exposed to interest rate risk  if we used additional financing to fund capital expenditures 
the interest rate that we may be able to obtain on financings will depend on market conditions at that time and may differ from the rates we have secured in the past 
the notes do not contain significant restrictive covenants 
the following table shows the fair values of our investments and convertible subordinated notes as of december  in thousands cost fair value cash and cash equivalents including unrealized gains of available for sale investments including unrealized losses of  convertible subordinated notes foreign currency risk we are exposed to currency exchange fluctuations  as we sell our products internationally and have operations in costa rica  germany and mexico 
we manage the sensitivity of our international sales  purchases of raw materials and equipment and our costa rican operations by denominating most transactions in us dollars 
we do engage in limited foreign currency hedging transactions  principally to lock in the cost of purchase commitments and to hedge material cash flows that are not denominated in us dollars  in accordance with a foreign exchange risk management policy approved by our board of directors 
we primarily use currency forward contracts for this purpose 
this hedging activity will reduce  but may not always entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange movements 
as of december  and  we had forward currency contracts outstanding of approximately million and million  respectively 
the contracts designated as cash flow hedges at december  and  were approximately million and million  respectively 
the contracts designated as balance sheet hedges at december  and  approximately million and million  respectively
