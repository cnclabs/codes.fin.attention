item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding our financial condition  and the results of operations for willow grove bancorp  inc  and its subsidiary willow grove bank  for the fiscal years ended june   and the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere herein 
general net income is largely driven by net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities and the relative amount of our interest earning assets to interest earning liabilities 
non interest income and expenses  the provision for loan losses and income tax expense also affect the company s results of operations 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
in management s opinion  the most critical accounting policies affecting the consolidated financial statements are evaluation of the allowance for loan losses 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves significant judgments and assumptions by management which may have a material impact on the carrying value of net loans and  potentially  on the amount of net income we recognize from period to period 
for a description of the methods the company uses to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  see results of operations provision for loan losses 
realization of deferred income tax items 
included in other assets is a net deferred tax asset  which is an estimate of net deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities 
these estimates involve significant judgments and assumptions by management  which may have a material effect on the carrying value of this asset for financial reporting purposes 
for a more detailed description of these items and estimates  see note income taxes to the audited consolidated financial statements at and for the fiscal year ended june  the notes to consolidated financial statements identify other significant accounting policies used in the development and presentation of the financial statements 
this discussion and analysis  the significant accounting policies and other financial statement disclosures identify and address key variables and other qualitative and quantitative factors that are necessary for an understanding and evaluation of the company and its results of operations 
changes in financial condition general 
total assets increased by million  or  to million at june  compared to million at june  this increase was primarily due to increases in the net loan portfolio of million  which was partially offset by reductions in investment securities available for sale and held to maturity of million and cash and cash equivalents of million 
the net growth in loans was funded primarily with fhlb borrowings  which increased by million or 
total deposits declined slightly by thousand due primarily to a reduction in more interest sensitive certificates of deposits of million  which was partially offset by an increase in core deposits savings  money market and checking accounts of million 
cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents  which consist of cash on hand and in other banks in interest earning and non interest earning accounts  amounted to million and million at june  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million or was a result of the funds being utilized to fund loan originations 
securities available for sale 
at june   investment securities that were classified as available for sale afs totaled million  compared to million in afs securities at june  the decrease in available for sale securities was a result of the company s asset liability strategy to increase the htm portfolio and allow the afs securities to decline with principal repayments and or sales 
additionally  the company s pending merger with chester valley was expected to require a de leveraging strategy and therefore the company did not wish to increase the investment security portfolio in general 
due primarily to the reduction in the amount of afs securities in our portfolio  the unrealized loss  net of income taxes  on afs securities amounted to approximately million at june  compared to million at june  securities held to maturity 
at june   investment securities classified as held to maturity totaled million  compared to million in held to maturity securities at june  held to maturity securities were comprised primarily of cmos  local municipal bonds  us government agency securities and mortgage backed securities 
the increase in held to maturity securities was part of the company s investment strategy to increase its portfolio in part to enhance earnings to supplement interest earned on loans 
held to maturity investment securities are carried at amortized cost 
loans 
the net loan portfolio  exclusive of loans held for sale  increased to million at june  from million at june  during the fiscal year ended june   loan originations and purchases of million  were partially offset by scheduled loan repayments and prepayments aggregating million 
the increase in the net portfolio of million  or  was a result of increases in single family residential loans  construction loans and home equity loans 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in multi family and commercial real estate mortgage loans 
the company s single family residential mortgage loans amounted to million  or of the total loan portfolio  at june  compared to million  or of the total loan portfolio  at june  additionally  home equity loans amounted to of total loans  commercial real estate and multi family residential loans amounted to of loans  and construction loans amounted to of the total loans at june  in recent years the company has focused its strategy on increasing its portfolio of commercial real estate and multi family residential loans and construction loans as they generally have higher yields and shorter terms to maturity and or re pricing as compared to single family residential mortgage loans 
the million  or  increase in single family residential mortgage loans during the fiscal year ended june  was the result of the purchase of wholesale loan packages totaling million in newly originated single family residential loans and to a lesser extent  the internal origination of adjustable rate mortgage loans 
additional changes in the composition of the loan portfolio during the year ended june  were a decline of million in commercial real estate and multi family residential mortgage loans  an increase of million in construction mortgage loans  a number of which will convert to permanent multi family and or commercial real estate mortgages upon completion of the construction  an increase of million in home equity loans  a million increase in commercial business loans  and a thousand increase in consumer loans 
as multi family and commercial real estate and construction loans generally involve a higher degree of risk of loss compared to single family residential mortgage loans  the aggregate increase in these portfolios resulted in the allowance for loan losses being increased to million at june  compared to million at june   primarily through a charge to earnings through the provision for loan losses of million during the year ended june  loans held for sale 
mortgage loans originated or purchased with the intention of being sold into the secondary market are classified as held for sale and are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market value with any unrealized loss reflected in the statements of income 
at june   million of fixed rate  single family residential mortgages were classified as held for sale compared to million in loans classified as held for sale at june  the increase of thousand resulted primarily from the timing of the origination of the loan and its ultimate delivery to the purchaser of the loan 
in order to mitigate the risk of loss on the sale of these loans  the company generally commits these loans for sale  on a best efforts basis  to a third party at the time that the borrower locks the loan with the company 
intangible assets 
at june   intangible assets aggregated thousand as compared to thousand at june  intangible assets include a core deposit intangible and an unidentified intangible asset goodwill  which represents the excess cost over fair value of assets acquired over liabilities assumed in a branch acquisition  which occurred in the core deposit intangible is being amortized over a year life 
at june  the company had goodwill of thousand  which is periodically measured for impairment 
the company has not recorded any impairment losses as a result of this analysis 
deposits 
total deposits decreased by thousand  or  to million at june  compared to million at june  at june   checking accounts totaled million  representing an increase of million or compared to the balance of checking accounts at june  savings accounts decreased approximately million  or to million at june  compared to million at june   and money market accounts increased million or to million at june  compared to million at june  the aggregate increase in the above less interest sensitive accounts  which the company terms as core deposits  was million or 
at june   the company s more interest sensitive certificate of deposit accounts amounted to million or of the total deposit portfolio  a decrease of million  or from million or of total deposits at june  the change in the mix of the deposit portfolio is a direct result of a strategy to increase core deposit accounts and balances through targeted marketing as well as many depositor s unwillingness to extend the maturity of their certificate of deposit accounts into longer term certificate of deposit accounts in the current low interest rate environment and transferring funds from certificate of deposit accounts into competitive money market accounts until rates increase 
federal home loan bank advances 
advances from the fhlb provide the company with an additional source of funds to fund interest earning asset growth and are a tool in meeting the company s asset liability strategies 
at june   the total amount of these borrowings was million  an increase of million or a increase from the million outstanding at june  during the fiscal year ended june  the average balance of fhlb advances was million compared to million in the year ended june  the maximum amount of borrowings at any month end in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal the increased borrowings in fiscal resulted primarily from the company s interest earning asset growth exceeding growth in deposit balances 
stockholders equity 
at june   total stockholders equity amounted to million or of total assets compared to million or of assets at june  the increase of million  or was primarily due to net income of million  which was partially offset by the payment of cash dividends of million and the re purchase of treasury stock of million under the company s approved stock re purchase plan 
due to the pending acquisition of chester valley  the company reduced the level of stock repurchases during the current year from the million level of repurchases during fiscal other changes in stockholders equity for the year ended june  were an increase of million in comprehensive income as a result of a reduction in the unrealized loss in market value of afs securities  additional paid in capital increasing million to million primarily as a result of director and employee stock option exercises  and a decrease of thousand and thousand in unallocated shares held by the recognition and retention plan trust rrp and the employee stock ownership plan esop  respectively  primarily as a result of amortization related to the plans 
rrp amortization is five years on granted shares while esop expense is currently being amortized over years

net income for the year ended june  was million  an increase of thousand or 
the increase resulted primarily from an increase in net interest income of million  which was partially offset by a reduction in non interest income of thousand along with increases in the provision for loan losses and operating expenses of thousand and million which included a thousand litigation settlement  respectively 
net income for the year ended june  was million compared to million for the year ended june  fiscal net income decreased compared to fiscal primarily due to decreased net interest income of million  and increased non interest expense of million  respectively 
these were partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense of million  a decrease in the provision for loan losses of thousand and an increase in non interest income of thousand 
net interest income 
net interest income increased by million or to million for the year ended june  as compared to million for the year ended june  one factor that influences net interest income is the interest rate spread ie  the difference between the average yields on interest earning assets and the average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the average interest rate spread for the years ended june   and was  and  respectively 
the net interest margin ie  net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest earning assets was  and for the same three respective fiscal years 
after years of declines in the company s interest rate spread resulting from the historically low interest rate environment  the interest spread increased by basis points in fiscal as the yield on interest earning assets increased by basis points while the cost of interest bearing liabilities rose by basis points 
in addition to the improvement in the interest rate spread  the company s average earning assets increased by approximately thereby positively impacting net interest income during the year ended june  in fiscal year  net interest income declined by approximately million or to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  the interest rate spread declined from for fiscal to for fiscal during this period  the average cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased by basis points from during fiscal to 
this decrease was due primarily to the re pricing of maturing certificates of deposits at lower rates 
because certificates of deposit bear a stated interest for a specified term to maturity  there usually is a lagging effect on the cost of funds when market rates of interest change 
during the period of falling interest rates over this period  the bank continued to pay the higher rate on certificates of deposit until their maturity at which time they are re priced to approximate market conditions 
during this same period  the average yield on interest earning assets declined by basis points from during fiscal to during fiscal as higher yielding loans and or mortgage backed securities were prepaid and replaced by lower yielding assets at market rates 
partially offsetting the impact of the decline in the net interest spread was an increase in average interest earning assets of million in fiscal compared to fiscal interest income 
interest income includes the interest earned on loans and investment securities  as well as yield adjustments for the premiums  discounts and deferred fees or costs recorded in connection with the acquisition of these assets 
total interest income for the year ended june  was million compared to million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal was million or due primarily to an increase in the average balance of outstanding loans of million as well as an increase in the average balance of investment securities of million 
additionally  during the same period  the tax equivalent yield on interest earning assets increased by to from 
the decrease in interest income in fiscal compared to was million  or 
this decrease was primarily due to the overall decrease in the yield earned on loans and securities 
for fiscal  the yield on average interest earning assets dropped basis points to from in fiscal also contributing to the decline  during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   the average balance of higher yielding loans receivable decreased by million as higher yielding loans were prepaid 
during this period  the average yield on loans decreased basis points from to 
a modest increase in the average balance of securities outstanding was not enough to offset a decline in the average yield earned on investment securities from to 
interest expense 
interest expense consists of the interest paid to depositors on their interest bearing deposit accounts as well as interest paid on funds borrowed from the fhlb and certain escrow accounts 
for the fiscal year ended june   total interest expense was million compared to million and million  for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended june   interest expense increased by million  or compared to the fiscal year ended june  this increase was due primarily to an approximate million increase in average borrowings from the fhlb as well as an approximate increase in average interest costing deposits of approximately million 
also contributing to the increase was a basis point increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
compared to fiscal  the average cost of interest bearing deposits in fiscal increased to from 
the increased cost along with the increase in average balances resulted in an approximate thousand increase in interest expense on deposits 
although the average cost of borrowings declined to from for fiscal compared to fiscal  interest expense on borrowings increased by million due primarily to the aforementioned significant increase in average borrowings 
for the fiscal year ended june   interest expense decreased by million  or compared to the fiscal year ended june  this decrease was due primarily to a million decrease in interest paid on deposits primarily attributed to lower rates paid on our deposit accounts and a reduction in certificates of deposit as a percent of the total deposit portfolio 
compared to fiscal  our average cost of deposits in fiscal decreased by basis points from to while the average balance of interest bearing deposits increased by million from million to million 
interest expense on borrowing decreased by thousand  or during fiscal compared to the fiscal year ended june  the average balance of borrowings outstanding during fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal the average cost of these borrowings for fiscal was compared to during fiscal provision for loan losses 
in order to maintain the allowance for losses at a level that management deems adequate to absorb known and unknown losses which are both probable and can be reasonably estimated  a provision for loan losses is recorded through charges to earnings 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based upon the company s regular review of credit quality and is based upon  but not limited to  the following factors an evaluation of our loan portfolio  loss experience  current economic conditions  volume  growth  composition of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
the balance of the allowance for loan losses is an estimate and actual losses may vary from these estimates 
management assesses the allowance for loan losses at least quarterly and makes any necessary adjustments to maintain the allowance for losses at a level deemed adequate 
for the years ended june   and  the provisions for loan losses were million  thousand and million  respectively 
the increased provision for loan losses during fiscal was due primarily to the increase in outstanding loan balances as well as a change in the mix of the loan portfolio to increased balances in loan categories  which typically have a higher degree of inherent credit risk 
at june   the balance in the allowance for loan losses was million compared to million at june  management believes that the allowance for loan losses at june  was appropriate given  among other things  the overall improvement of our asset quality from june   the growth of certain sectors of our loan portfolio and the inherent credit risk associated with our loan portfolio 
the percentage of the allowance for losses to loans increased to at june  compared to at june  management believes  to the best of its knowledge based upon knowledge available to them at the time  the allowance for loan loss was adequate at june  and represents all known and inherent loses in the portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable  however  no assurance can be given as to the amount or timing of additional provisions for loan losses in the future as a result of potential increases in the amount of the company s non performing loans in the remainder of the company s loan portfolio 
regulatory agencies  in the course of their regular examinations  review the allowance for losses and carrying value of non performing assets 
no assurance can be given that these agencies might not require changes to the allowance for losses in the future 
non interest income 
non interest income is comprised of account service fees and charges  loan servicing fees  realized gains and losses on assets available or held for sale and increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance boli 
total non interest income for the years ended june    and was million  million and million  respectively 
the decline in non interest income of thousand during fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to reduction in gains on investment securities available for sale of approximately thousand due primarily to the rising interest rate environment throughout the year 
this was partially offset by an increase in service charges and fees of thousand due to the continued growth in the overdraft protection plan implemented during fiscal see below 
also  positively impacting non interest income was an increase in loan servicing income of thousand due to growth in the portfolio experienced in the prior year as well as reduced pre payments within this portfolio 
gains on the sale of loans held for sale declined by thousand as a result of the rising interest rate environment and income credited on boli declined by thousand as the crediting rate was reduced 
the increase in non interest income of thousand or for fiscal compared to fiscal  was due primarily to increases in service charges  fees and the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance  partially offset by the decline in gains on sales of loans and securities 
during the fiscal year ended june  service charges and fees increased  or to million 
the increases in service charges were primarily the result of our recently implemented overdraft protection plan opp  increased retail sales of annuities and loan prepayment penalties 
for the fiscal year ended june   the company realized gains of  and  on the sale of securities and loans  respectively  compared to gains of million and million  respectively  during the corresponding comparable fiscal year ended june  non interest expense 
the primary components of non interest expense are compensation and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  data processing costs  deposit account services  professional fees and a variety of other expenses 
for the years ended june    and  non interest expense totaled million  million and million  respectively 
the primary reason for the increase in non interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was a million increase in other non interest expense due primarily to thousand in merger related charges  thousand in consulting fees and a thousand settlement of a legal proceeding 
the primary reason for the increase in non interest expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to a thousand increase in compensation and employee benefits 
compensation and benefits expenses totaled million  million and million  respectively  for the fiscal years ended june    and for the year ended june   compensation and benefit costs increased approximately thousand or due primarily to normal salary increases 
for the fiscal year ended june   these costs increased thousand or as compared to the fiscal year ended june  some factors contributing to the increase in compensation and benefits include expansion of the branch network  increased costs to expand and support the lending function and costs of stock benefit plans that have increased due to the appreciation of the company s stock value and the full year impact of additional allocated shares in the company s recognition and retention plan 
the company s esop expense increased  or for the year ended june   compared to  for the year ended june  costs of the rrp grants were  for the year ended june  compared to  for fiscal year ended june  occupancy and furniture and equipment expenses were million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended june    and  respectively 
during fiscal year  these costs increased thousand due to normal type annual increases 
in fiscal  the  increase as compared to fiscal was primarily due to slight increases in operating costs as well as a full year of expenses associated with our th branch office 
advertising expenses for fiscal  and were thousand  thousand and thousand  respectively 
during fiscal  the company increased its local media advertising as part of a campaign to grow core deposits as well as increasing the bank s name recognition in the marketplace 
for the fiscal years ended june    and  amortization of intangible assets was   and  respectively 
the decline annually was the result of no additional intangible assets being recorded while the assets are being amortized on an accelerated method that approximates a level yield 
data processing expenses were thousand  thousand  and thousand  respectively  for fiscal  and the large increase in the current fiscal year resulted from increased accounts and a rate increase in the company s third party data processing contract  as the company did not renew the contract for the full term in anticipation of our merger with chester valley 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of account growth in both loans and deposits 
deposit account service expenses were thousand  thousand  and thousand  respectively  with the annual increases being the result in core deposit checking  savings and money market account growth 
professional fees were thousand  thousand and thousand  respectively 
increases in professional fees were due primarily to costs related to the company s review of potential acquisition transactions including the chester valley acquisition in the current year and other general corporate matters 
for the fiscal years ended june    and  other expenses  which include miscellaneous operating items  were million  million and million  respectively 
included in other expenses for the year ended june   is an approximate thousand settlement of a legal proceeding  a thousand charge for merger integration costs as well as an increase in consulting costs of thousand  related largely to consultant assistance in the implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
income tax provision 
income tax expense amounted to million for the year ended june  this compares to a tax expense of million  and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates for fiscal  and were  and  respectively 
the increase in the income tax expense and the effective tax rate for the year ended june  was primarily related to an increase in the pre tax income and reduction in the level of tax free investments as a percentage of total assets 
the decrease for the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  resulted primarily from lower pre tax income as well as an increase in tax free investments as a percentage of total assets 
liquidity and commitments the company s primary sources of funds are from deposits  principal amortization of loans  loan and securities prepayments and repayments  interest income from loans  mortgage backed securities and other investments  and other funds provided from operations 
while scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and mortgage backed securities and maturing investment securities are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments can be greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we also maintain excess funds in short term  interest bearing assets that provide additional liquidity 
we have also utilized outside borrowings  primarily from the fhlb of pittsburgh as an additional funding source 
we use our liquidity resources to fund existing and future loan commitments  to fund maturing certificates of deposit and demand deposit withdrawals  to invest in other interest earning assets  and to meet operating expenses 
at june   outstanding approved loan commitments were million and certificates of deposit maturing within the next twelve months amounted million 
based upon historical experience  it is anticipated that a significant portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be reinvested in the bank 
due to the interest rate environment during the year ended june   the company continued to experience higher than a normal amount of prepayments of loans and mortgage backed securities as borrowers repaid higher rate loans and refinanced those loans at lower rates 
the low rate environment also increased the amount of bonds with call provisions being exercised by the issuer so that they could take advantage of a lower borrowing cost 
these accelerated repayments have increased our liquidity 
the rising interest rate environment during fiscal reduced the level of prepayments  however  long term rates remain relatively low from a historical standpoint and thus the company continues to experience higher than normal prepayments 
during the past two fiscal years  the company increased its use of borrowings from the fhlb as a cost effective means to obtain funds at varying maturities to implement asset liability strategies 
outstanding borrowings from the fhlb have increased to million at june  compared to million at june  under terms of the borrowing agreement with the fhlb  the bank pledges certain assets such as residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities as well as stock in the fhlb as collateral for these advances 
at june   the bank had million in additional borrowing capacity available from the fhlb as well as million in borrowing lines from other financial intermediaries 
the company has not in the past used any significant off balance sheet financing arrangement for liquidity or other purposes 
our financial assets with off balance sheet risk are limited to obligations to fund loans to borrowers pursuant to existing loan commitments 
additionally  the company has not had any transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated  limited purpose entities that could affect its liquidity or capital resources  nor do we currently intend to engage in trading commodity contracts 
with its acquisition of chester valley bancorp and the resulting increased size of the combined companies  the company may  from time to time  utilize certain derivative financial instruments to assist in its asset liability strategies 
the company fully anticipates that it will continue to have sufficient funds and alternative funding sources to meet its current commitments 
the company s contractual obligations as of june  are as follows payments due by period total less than year years years more than years dollars in thousands federal home loan debt     operating leases   total obligations      total less than year years years more than years lines of credit    standby letters of credit   other commitments to make loans   undisbursed funds on previous disbursed loans   total     impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements  accompanying notes  and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
most of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  therefore  the impact of interest rates has a greater impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk asset liability management and interest rate risk the market value of assets and liabilities  as well as future earnings  can be affected by interest rate risk 
market values of financial assets have an inverse relationship to rates  ie  when interest rates rise  the market value of many of the company s assets decline and when rates fall  the market value of many of the company s assets rise 
the primary assets of the company are loans to borrowers who often have the ability to prepay their loan 
therefore  in a falling rate environment  the increase in the market value of the company s assets is limited by this option for the borrower to prepay the loan 
the ability to maximize net interest income is largely dependent upon the achievement of a positive interest spread that can be maintained during fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity gap gap is a measure of the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that either mature or re price within a specified time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest earning assets exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities  and is considered negative when interest bearing liabilities exceed interest earning assets 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would generally result in an increase in net interest income  and a positive gap would result in a decrease in net interest income 
this is usually the case  however  interest rates on differing financial instruments will not always change at the same time or to the same extent 
the following gap table shows the amount as of june  of assets and liabilities projected to mature or re price within various time periods 
this table includes certain assumptions management has made that affect the rate at which loans will prepay as well as the duration of core deposits 
changes in interest rates may affect these assumptions  which would impact our gap position 
to months to months to years to years over years total dollars in thousands interest earning deposits   securities       loans receivable      total interest earning assets    certificates of deposit other interest bearing deposits     fhlb advances       total interest bearing liabilities    excess deficiency of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities cumulative excess deficiency of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities cumulative excess deficiency of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities as a percent of total assets ratio of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities cumulative ratio of interest earning assets to assets to interest bearing liabilities at june   the ratio of the cumulative interest earning assets maturing or re pricing in one year or less to interest bearing liabilities maturing or re pricing in one year or less is  which results in a cumulative one year gap to total assets ratio of negative  indicating that the bank s net interest income could decline depending upon the degree to which interest rates change and the change in the relationship between interest rates used to re price assets and interest rates used in the re pricing of liabilities 
upon the completion of the merger coupled with the de leveraging strategy implemented by the bank  it is expected that the interest sensitivity will improve significantly in that the proportion of interest earning assets re pricing within one and three year time horizons as compared to interest bearing liabilities re pricing in the same horizons will be increased 
additionally  certain interest rate swaps and interest rate corridors employed by first financial bank will benefit the overall interest sensitivity of the combined companies 
the company has adopted asset liability management policies designed to quantify the interest rate risk caused by mismatches in the maturities and re pricing of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
these interest rate risk and asset liability management actions are taken under the guidance of the asset liability management committee alco 
the alco s purpose is to communicate  coordinate and control asset liability management consistent with our business plan and board approved policies 
the objective of the alco is to manage asset and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability goals 
the alco meets at least quarterly and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources taking into account the relative costs and spreads  the interest rate sensitivity gap and liquidity needs 
the alco also reviews economic conditions and interest rate projections  current and projected liquidity needs and capital positions  anticipated changes in the mix of assets and liabilities  and interest rate exposure limits versus current projections pursuant to gap analysis and interest income simulations 
at each meeting  the alco recommends changes in strategy as appropriate 
interest rate risk issues are also discussed by the board of directors on a regular basis 
management meets periodically to monitor progress in achieving asset liability targets approved by the board  particularly the type and rate on asset generation and sources of funding 
in order to manage the company s assets and liabilities and improve our interest rate risk position  emphasis has been placed on the origination of assets with shorter maturities or adjustable rates such as commercial and multi family real estate loans  construction loans  home equity loans and to a lesser extent commercial business loans 
at the same time  other actions include attempts to increase our core deposits and the use of fhlb advances as additional sources of funds 
additionally  longer term fixed rate single family residential mortgage loans are originated and held for sale 
the alco regularly reviews interest rate risk by  among other things  examining the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net interest income and net portfolio value npv  and the change in npv 
npv is the difference between the market value of assets and the market value of liabilities and off balance sheet items under various interest rate scenarios 
sensitivity is the difference measured in basis points between the npv to assets ratio at market rate and the npv to assets ratio determined under each rate scenario 
the alco monitors both the npv and sensitivity according to guidelines established by the office of thrift supervision ots in thrift bulletin a management of interest rate risk  investment securities and derivative activities  and board approved limitations 
presented below  as of june  and  is an analysis of the interest rate risk position as measured by npv and sensitivity based upon various rate scenarios 
these values have been obtained from data submitted by the bank to the ots 
the ots performs scenario analysis to estimate current or base case economic value and estimates npv that would result from instantaneous  parallel shifts of the yields on various financial instruments of plus and minus  and basis points 
due to the level of current interest rates  no values are calculated for hypothetical rate scenarios of down basis points at june  or down more than basis points at june  the model does not value new business activities 
it only provides an estimate of economic value at a point in time and the economic value of the same portfolio under the above referenced interest rate scenarios

the bank s sensitivity in the plus basis point rate scenario decreased from negative basis points at june  to negative basis points at june  the primary reasons for this increase were decreases in the balances of fixed rate residential mortgage loans as well as a decline in the balance of callable us agency securities 
npv is more sensitive and may be more negatively impacted by rising interest rates than by declining rates 
this occurs primarily because as rates rise  the market value of long term fixed rate assets  like fixed rate mortgage loans  declines due to both the rate increase and slowing prepayments 
when rates decline  these assets do not experience similar appreciation in value 
this is due to the decrease in the duration of the asset resulting from the increase in prepayments 
upon completion of the merger  which was effective after the close of business on august   the net portfolio value of equity is expected to be reduced as a result of the goodwill that will result once the purchase accounting valuations are finalized 
the exact impact cannot be estimated at this time  however  the interest sensitivity is expected to remain stable as a result of ffb s asset sensitive balance sheet as well as the above noted de leveraging strategy employed by the bank
