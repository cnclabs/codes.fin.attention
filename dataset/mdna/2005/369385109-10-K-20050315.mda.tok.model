item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information about the effect of geographic concentration and the alaska economy on us 
factors that may affect our business and future results additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations 
any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
risks relating to our business and operations we face competition that may reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 
there is substantial competition in the communications industry 
the traditional dividing lines between long distance telephone service  local telephone service  wireless telephone service  internet services and video services are increasingly becoming blurred 
through mergers and various service integration strategies  major providers are striving to provide integrated communications services offerings within and across geographic markets 
we expect competition to increase as a result of the rapid development of new technologies  products and services 
we cannot predict which of many possible future technologies  products or services will be important to maintain our competitive position or what expenditures will be required to develop and provide these technologies  products or services 
our ability to compete successfully will depend on marketing and on our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry  including new services that may be introduced  changes in consumer preferences  economic conditions and pricing strategies by competitors 
to the extent we do not keep pace with technological advances or fail to timely respond to changes in competitive factors in our industry and in our markets  we could lose market share or experience a decline in our revenue and net income 
competitive conditions create a risk of market share loss and the risk that customers shift to less profitable lower margin services 
competitive pressures also create challenges for our ability to grow new businesses or introduce new services successfully and execute our business plan 
each of our business segments also faces the risk of potential price cuts by our competitors that could materially adversely affect our market share and gross margins 
long distance services 
the long distance industry is intensely competitive and subject to constant technological change 
competition is based upon price and pricing plans  the type of services offered  customer service  billing services  performance  perceived quality  reliability and availability 
current or future competitors could be substantially larger than we are  or have greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
in the long distance market  we compete against at t alascom  acs  mta and certain smaller rural local telephone carrier affiliates 
there is also the possibility that new competitors will enter the alaska market 
in addition  wireless services continue to grow as an alternative to wireline services as a means of reaching customers 
historically  we have competed in the long distance market by offering discounts from rates charged by our competitors and by providing desirable packages of services 
discounts have been eroded in recent years due to lowering of prices by at t alascom and entry of other competitors into the long distance markets we serve 
in addition  our competitors offer their own packages of services 
if competitors lower their rates further or develop more attractive packages of services  we may be forced to reduce our rates or add additional services  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
cable services 
our cable television systems face competition from alternative methods of receiving and distributing television signals  including dbs and digital video over telephone lines  and from other sources of news  information and entertainment such as off air television broadcast programming  newspapers  movie theaters  live sporting events  interactive computer services  internet services and home video products  including videotape cassettes and video disks 
our cable television systems also face competition from potential overbuilds of our existing cable systems by other cable television operators and alternative methods of receiving and distributing television signals 
the extent to which our cable television systems are competitive depends  in part  upon our ability to provide quality programming and other services at competitive prices 
we believe that the greatest source of potential competition for video services could come from the dbs industry 
we also are subject to competition from providers of digital video over telephone lines in the mat su valley and potentially in ketchikan in with the addition of anchorage local broadcast stations  increased marketing  ilec and dbs alliances  and emerging technologies creating new opportunities  competition from these sources has increased and will likely continue to increase 
the changing nature of technology and of the dbs business may result in greater satellite coverage within the state of alaska 
the resulting increase in competition may adversely affect our market share and results of operations from our cable services segment 
local telephone services 
in the local telephone market  we compete against acs the ilec  in anchorage  juneau and fairbanks 
we may provide local telephone service in other locations in the future where we would face other competitors 
in the local telephone services market  the telecom act  judicial decisions and state legislative and regulatory developments have increased the overall likelihood that barriers to local telephone competition will be substantially reduced or removed 
these initiatives include requirements that local exchange carriers negotiate with entities  including us  to provide interconnection to the existing local telephone network  to allow the purchase  at cost based rates  of access to unbundled network elements  to establish dialing parity  to obtain access to rights of way and to resell services offered by the ilec 
we have been able to obtain interconnection  access and related services from the lecs  at rates that allow us to offer competitive services 
however  if we are unable to continue to obtain these services and access at acceptable rates  our ability to offer local telephone services  and our revenues and net income  could be materially adversely affected 
to date  we have been successful in capturing a significant portion of the local telephone market in the locations where we are offering these services 
however  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in attracting or retaining these customers 
internet services 
the internet industry is highly competitive  rapidly evolving and subject to constant technological change 
competition is based upon price and pricing plans  service packages  the types of services offered  the technologies used  customer service  billing services  perceived quality  reliability and availability 
we compete with several alaska based internet providers and other domestic  non alaska based providers 
several of the providers have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
with respect to our high speed cable modem service  acs and other alaska telephone service providers are providing competitive high speed internet access over their telephone lines 
dbs providers and others also provide wireless high speed internet service in competition with our high speed cable modem services 
competitive local fixed wireless providers are providing service in certain of our markets 
niche providers in the industry  both local and national  compete with certain of our internet service products  such as web hosting  list services and email 
our business is subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation 
applicable legislation and regulations and changes to them could adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
local telephone services 
our success in the local telephone market depends on our continued ability to obtain interconnection  access and related services from local exchange carriers on terms that are just and reasonable and that are based on the cost of providing these services 
our local telephone services business faces the risk of the impact of the implementation of current regulations and legislation  unfavorable changes in regulation or legislation or the introduction of new regulations 
our ability to enter into the local telephone market depends on our negotiation or arbitration with local exchange carriers to allow interconnection to the carrier s existing local telephone network  to allow the purchase  at cost based rates  of access to unbundled network elements  to establish dialing parity  to obtain access to rights of way and to resell services offered by the local exchange carrier 
in most alaska markets  it also depends on our ability to have the rural exemption for certain carriers terminated  so these carriers are obligated to provide access to unbundled network elements at economic costs  and on our ability to gain interconnection at economic costs 
future arbitration and rural exemption proceedings with respect to new or existing markets could result in a change in our cost of serving these markets via the facilities of the ilec or via wholesale offerings 
cable services 
the cable television industry is subject to extensive regulation at various levels  and many aspects of such regulation are currently the subject of judicial proceedings and administrative or legislative proposals 
the law permits certified local franchising authorities to order refunds of rates paid in the previous month period determined to be in excess of the reasonable rates 
it is possible that rate reductions or refunds of previously collected fees may be required of us in the future 
currently  pursuant to alaska law  the basic cable rates in juneau are the only rates in alaska subject to regulation by the local franchising authority  and the rates in juneau were reviewed and approved by the regulatory commission of alaska  or rca  in october other existing federal regulations  currently the subject of judicial  legislative  and administrative review  could change  in varying degrees  the manner in which cable television systems operate 
neither the outcome of these proceedings nor their impact upon the cable television industry in general  or on our activities and prospects in the cable television business in particular  can be predicted at this time 
there can be no assurance that future regulatory actions taken by congress  the fcc or other federal  state or local government authorities will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
proposals may be made before congress and the fcc to mandate cable operators provide open access over their cable systems to internet service providers 
as of the date of this report  the fcc has declined to impose such requirements 
if the fcc or other authorities mandate additional access to our cable systems  we cannot predict the effect that this would have on our internet service offerings 
internet services 
changes in the regulatory environment relating to the internet access market  including changes in legislation  fcc regulation  judicial action or local regulation that affect communications costs or increase competition from the ilec or other communications services providers  could adversely affect the prices at which we sell internet services 
we depend on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue and business 
the loss of any of such customers would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
for the year ended december   we provided long distance services excluding private lines and other revenue to mci and to sprint corporation  or sprint  which generated combined revenues of approximately of our total revenues for these two customers are free to seek out long distance communications services from our competitors upon expiration of their contracts in july in the case of mci  and in march in the case of sprint or earlier upon the occurrence of certain contractually stipulated events including a default  the occurrence of a force majeure event  or a substantial change in applicable law or regulation under the applicable contract 
additionally  the contracts provide for periodic reviews to assure that the prices paid by mci and sprint for their services remain competitive 
mergers and acquisitions in the communications industry are relatively common 
if a change in control of mci or sprint were to occur  it would not permit them to terminate their existing contracts with us  but could in the future result in the termination of or a material adverse change in our relationships with mci or sprint 
in addition  mci s and sprint s need for our long distance services depends directly upon their ability to obtain and retain their own long distance customers and upon the needs of those customers for long distance services 
the loss of one or both of mci or sprint as customers  a material adverse change in our relationships with either of them or a material loss of or reduction in their long distance customers would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
our businesses are currently geographically concentrated in alaska 
any deterioration in the economic conditions in alaska could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
we offer voice and data communication and video services to customers primarily in the state of alaska 
because of this geographic concentration  our growth and operations depend upon economic conditions in alaska 
the economy of alaska is dependent upon natural resource industries  in particular oil production  as well as tourism  and government spending including substantial amounts for the united states military 
any deterioration in these markets could have an adverse impact on the demand for communication and cable television services and on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the customer base in alaska is limited 
alaska has a population of approximately  people  approximately of whom are located in the anchorage area 
we have already achieved significant market penetration with respect to our service offerings in anchorage and in other locations in alaska 
we may not be able to continue to increase our market share of the existing markets for our services and no assurance can be given that the alaskan economy will continue to grow and increase the size of the markets we serve or increase the demand for the services we offer 
as a result  the best opportunities for expanding our business may arise in other geographic areas such as the contiguous lower states 
there can be no assurance that we will find attractive opportunities to grow our businesses outside the state of alaska or that we will have the necessary expertise to take advantage of such opportunities 
the markets in alaska for voice and data communications and video services are unique and distinct within the united states due to alaska s large geographical size and its distance from the rest of the united states 
the expertise we have developed in operating our businesses in the state of alaska may not provide us with the necessary expertise to successfully enter other geographic markets 
we may not develop our wireless services  in which case we could not meet the needs of our customers who desire packaged services 
we offer wireless mobile services by distributing other providers wireless mobile services 
we offer wireless local telephone services over our own facilities  and have purchased personal communications system  or pcs  and local multipoint distribution system  or lmds  wireless broadband licenses in fcc auctions covering markets in alaska 
we have fewer subscribers to our wireless services than to our other service offerings 
the geographic coverage of our wireless services is also smaller than the geographic coverage of our other services 
some of our competitors offer or propose to offer an integrated bundle of communications  entertainment and information services  including wireless services 
if we are unable to expand and further develop our wireless services  we may not be able to meet the needs of customers who desire packaged services  and our competitors who offer these services would have an advantage 
this could result in the loss of market share for our other service offerings 
as a pcs and lmds licensee  we are subject to regulation by the fcc  and must comply with certain build out and other conditions of the licenses  as well as with the fcc s regulations governing the pcs and lmds services 
the conditions of our pcs licenses require us to satisfy certain build out requirements on or before june  in february we submitted a filing to the fcc supporting our compliance with such requirements 
our efforts to deploy dlps may be unsuccessful  in which case the margins on our local telephone services business will not improve and we will not recover any capital investment that we have made in dlps 
an element of our business strategy is to deploy voice telephone service utilizing our hybrid fiber coax cable facilities 
in april we successfully launched our dlps deployment utilizing our anchorage coaxial cable facilities 
dlps allows us to utilize our own cable facilities to provide local access to our customers and avoid paying local loop charges to the ilec 
to continue to successfully deploy this service  we must integrate new technology with our existing facilities and modify our operating procedures to timely detect and effect repairs of our outside plant network 
the long term viability of this service depends on the adoption of industry wide standards for the sending and receiving of voice communications over cable facilities and the availability of the equipment necessary to provide the service at a cost effective price 
the deployment of this service may require a substantial capital investment by us 
if we are unable to successfully deploy dlps to a sufficiently large portion of our customer base  we will not be able to recover all of the capital investment we may make and the margins on our local telephone services business will not improve 
prolonged service interruptions could affect our business 
we rely heavily on our network equipment  communications providers  data and software  to support all of our functions 
we rely on our networks and the networks of others for substantially all of our revenues 
we are able to deliver services only to the extent that we can protect our network systems against damage from power or communication failures  computer viruses  natural disasters  unauthorized access and other disruptions 
while we endeavor to provide for failures in the network by providing back up systems and procedures  we cannot guarantee that these back up systems and procedures will operate satisfactorily in an emergency 
should we experience a prolonged failure  it could seriously jeopardize our ability to continue operations 
in particular  should a significant service interruption occur  our ongoing customers may choose a different provider  and our reputation may be damaged  reducing our attractiveness to new customers 
to the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our customers data or applications  or inappropriate disclosure of confidential information  we may incur liability and suffer from adverse publicity 
in addition  we may incur additional costs to remedy the damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches 
if failures occur in our undersea fiber optic cables  our ability to immediately restore the entirety of our service may be limited  which could lead to a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
our communications facilities include an undersea fiber optic cable that carries a large portion of our internet voice and data traffic to and from the contiguous lower states 
we completed construction of aulp west in june that provides an alternative backup communications facility 
if a failure of both sides of the ring of our undersea fiber optic facilities occurs and we are not able to secure alternative facilities  some of the communications services we offer to our customers could be interrupted  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
if a failure occurs in our satellite communications systems  our ability to immediately restore the entirety of our service may be limited 
we serve many rural and remote alaska locations solely via satellite communications 
each of our c and ku band satellite transponders is backed up on the same spacecraft with multiple backup transponders 
our primary spacecraft is panamsat s galaxy xr  but we also lease capacity on two other spacecraft for services we provide  ses americom s amc and amc on galaxy xr  we use c band transponders 
we have arranged for backup c band satellite capacity on another panamsat spacecraft  galaxy xiii  for all of those satellite transponders in the unlikely event of a total primary spacecraft failure 
if such a failure occurs  service may not be fully restored for up to a week or longer due to the time necessary to redirect earth station antennae 
we also own one ku band satellite transponder on the same primary spacecraft galaxy xr that provides our c band service 
in the event of total primary spacecraft failure  we believe we would be able to restore our ku band transponder traffic on galaxy xiii  although no pre arrangement for its backup is currently in place 
we lease on a short term basis an additional megahertz of protected but un backed up transponder capacity on another galaxy xr transponder 
such capacity is protected by the same satellite for transponder failure  but in the event of total spacecraft failure  this leased space segment would not be restored 
we also lease approximately megahertz of protected and backed up c band capacity on ses americom s amc spacecraft 
ses americom s amc is the backup spacecraft for amc we also lease certain c band transponder capacity on amc that can be preempted in the case of a satellite failure 
the services that are preempted would not be immediately restored should amc fail or be called up to provide restoration of another of ses americom s spacecraft 
we depend on a limited number of third party vendors to supply communications equipment 
if we do not obtain the necessary communications equipment  we will not be able to meet the needs of our customers 
we depend on a limited number of third party vendors to supply cable  internet  dlps and telephony related equipment 
if our providers of this equipment are unable to timely supply the equipment necessary to meet our needs or provide them at an acceptable cost  we may not be able to satisfy demand for our services and competitors may fulfill this demand 
we do not have insurance to cover certain risks to which we are subject  which could lead to the incurrence of uninsured liabilities that adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
we are self insured for damage or loss to certain of our transmission facilities  including our buried  under sea and above ground transmission lines 
if we become subject to substantial uninsured liabilities due to damage or loss to such facilities  our financial position  results of operations or liquidity may be adversely affected 
new corporate governance rules impose increased costs and internal control assessment requirements on us 
the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the sec  the public company accounting oversight board  and the nasdaq national market  have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies 
we expect to incur ongoing costs to comply with these rules and regulations  as well as increased legal and financial compliance costs 
for example  section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting and have our auditor attest to such evaluation 
in we incurred operating costs totaling million and capital costs totaling  to comply with section since our systems  processes and internal controls thereon change over time  we cannot assure you that there may not be material weaknesses that would be required to be reported in the future 
we must apply a direct value method to determine the fair value of our cable certificate assets for purposes of impairment testing on an annual basis 
impairment testing may result in a material  non cash write down of our cable certificate or goodwill assets and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
under statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we must test our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually 
on september   the sec issued sec staff announcement topic use of the residual method to value acquired assets other than goodwill  requiring us to apply no later than january  a direct value method to determine the fair value of our intangible assets with indefinite lives other than goodwill for purposes of impairment testing 
we must also recognize previously unrecognized intangible assets  if any  in the determination of fair value for impairment testing purposes 
our cable certificate assets are our only indefinite lived assets other than goodwill as of december  our cable certificate assets were originally valued and recorded using the residual method 
impairment testing of our cable certificate assets in future periods under statement of financial accounting standard no 
must use a direct value method pursuant to such sec staff announcement  which may result in a material  non cash write down of our cable certificate assets and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
our significant debt could adversely affect our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our senior notes 
we have and will continue to have a significant amount of debt 
on december   we had total debt of approximately million 
our high level of debt could have important consequences  including the following o use of a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our senior notes  the senior secured credit facility and our other debt  which will reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  research and development expenditures and other business activities  o current and future debt under our senior secured credit facility will continue to be secured  o increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  o limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  o restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities  o make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the senior notes and our other debt  o place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and o limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds  dispose of assets or pay cash dividends 
in addition  a substantial amount of our debt bears interest at variable rates 
if market interest rates increase  variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements  which would adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
we will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that may be beyond our control 
our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us under our senior secured credit facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity 
we may not be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
despite our current significant level of debt  we may still be able to incur substantially more debt 
this could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial debt 
we may be able to incur substantial debt in the future 
although the indenture governing the senior notes contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt  these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and  under certain circumstances  debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial 
if new debt is added to our current debt levels  the substantial risks described above would intensify 
the terms of our debt impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business and our ability to make payments on the senior notes 
the indenture governing our senior notes contains and or the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facility contains covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to o incur additional debt and issue preferred stock  o pay dividends or make other restricted payments  o make certain investments  o create liens  o allow restrictions on the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us  o sell assets  o merge or consolidate with other entities  and o enter into transactions with affiliates 
the senior secured credit facility also requires us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests  including  but not limited to  minimum interest coverage ratio  maximum leverage ratio and maximum annual capital expenditures 
these covenants could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs and to engage in other business activities that may be in our best interest 
all of these covenants may restrict our ability to expand or to pursue our business strategies 
our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control  such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in regulations  and if such events occur  we cannot be sure that we will be able to comply 
a breach of these covenants could result in a default under the indenture governing our senior notes and or the senior secured credit facility 
if there were an event of default under the indenture for the senior notes and or the senior secured credit facility  holders of such defaulted debt could cause all amounts borrowed under these instruments to be due and payable immediately 
additionally  if we fail to repay the debt under the senior secured credit facility when it becomes due  the lenders under the senior secured credit facility could proceed against certain of our assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries that we have pledged to them as security 
our assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments in the event of a default thereunder 
a significant percentage of our voting securities are owned by a small number of shareholders and these shareholders can control stockholder decisions on very important matters 
as of december   our executive officers and directors and their affiliates owned approximately of our combined outstanding class a and class b common stock  representing approximately of the combined voting power of that stock including outstanding series b preferred stock voting with class a common stock on an as converted basis 
these shareholders can significantly influence  if not control  our management policy and all fundamental corporate actions  including mergers  substantial acquisitions and dispositions  and election of directors to the board 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred on september   and other attacks or acts of war may adversely affect us 
the attacks of september   and subsequent events have caused instability in the local  national and international economies and markets and have led  and may continue to lead  to further armed hostilities or to further acts of terrorism in the united states or elsewhere  which could cause further instability in such economies and markets 
in addition  armed hostilities and further acts of terrorism may directly impact our physical facilities and operations or those of our customers 
furthermore  terrorist attacks  subsequent events and future developments may adversely affect our customers or their facilities or otherwise result in reduced demand from our customers for our services 
any of the foregoing could subject our operations to increased risks and  depending on their magnitude  could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
employees we employed  persons as of january   and we are not party to union contracts with our employees 
we believe our future success will depend upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified employees 
we believe that relations with our employees are satisfactory 
other no material portion of our businesses is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the federal government

capital expenditures capital expenditures consist primarily of a gross additions to property  plant and equipment having an estimated service life of one year or more  plus the incidental costs of preparing the asset for its intended use  and b gross additions to capitalized software 
the total investment in property  plant and equipment has increased from million at january  to million at december   including construction in progress and not including deductions of accumulated depreciation 
significant additions to property  plant and equipment will be required in the future to meet the growing demand for communications  internet and entertainment services and to continually modernize and improve such services to meet competitive demands 
our capital expenditures for through were as follows in millions we project capital expenditures of million to million for we have made purchase commitments totaling approximately million at december  a majority of the expenditures are expected to expand  enhance and modernize our current networks  facilities and operating systems  and to develop other businesses

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to unbilled revenues  cost of goods sold exclusive of depreciation  amortization and accretion shown separately cost of goods sold accruals  allowance for doubtful accounts  depreciation  amortization and accretion periods  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

long distance services segment overview long distance services segment revenue in represented of consolidated revenues 
our provision of interstate and intrastate long distance services  private line and leased dedicated capacity services  and broadband services accounted for of our total long distance services segment revenues during factors that have the greatest impact on year to year changes in long distance services segment revenues include the rate per minute charged to customers  usage volumes expressed as minutes of use  and the number of private line  leased dedicated service and broadband products in use 
due in large part to the favorable synergistic effects of our bundling strategy  the long distance services segment continues to be a significant contributor to our overall performance  although the migration of traffic from voice to data and from fixed to mobile wireless continues 
our long distance services segment faces significant competition from at t alascom  long distance resellers  and local telephone companies that have entered the long distance market 
we believe our approach to developing  pricing  and providing long distance services and bundling different business segment services will continue to allow us to be competitive in providing those services 
on july  mci and substantially all of its active united states subsidiaries  on a combined basis a major customer  filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court 
on july   the united states bankruptcy court approved a settlement agreement for pre petition amounts owed to us by mci and affirmed all of our existing contracts with mci 
mci emerged from bankruptcy protection on april  the remaining pre petition accounts receivable balance owed by mci to us after this settlement was million mci credit which we have used and will continue to use as a credit against amounts payable for services purchased from mci 
after settlement  we began reducing the mci credit as we utilized it for services otherwise payable to mci 
we have accounted for our use of the mci credit as a gain contingency  and  accordingly  are recognizing a reduction of bad debt expense as services are provided by mci and the credit is realized 
during and we realized approximately million and million  respectively  of the mci credit against amounts payable for services received from mci 
the remaining unused mci credit totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the credit balance is not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as we are recognizing recovery of bad debt expense as the credit is realized 
in february verizon communications  inc agreed to purchase mci 
the agreement requires approval of shareholders and anti trust regulators 
verizon has allowed mci two weeks beginning in early march to conduct additional talks with quest communications international  inc  another potential buyer 
we are unable to predict the impact that a merger with or an acquisition of mci will have upon us in the long term  however given the materiality of mci s revenues to us  a significant reduction in traffic or pricing could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
the initial term of our contract to provide interstate and intrastate long distance services to sprint ends in march with two one year automatic extensions to march in june we amended the original agreement resulting in new annual rate reductions beginning july contractual rate reductions will continue to occur annually through the end of the initial term of the contract 
in december sprint and nextel communications  inc announced a merger 
the agreement requires approval of shareholders and anti trust regulators  as well as state utility commissions that license phone service 
we are unable to predict the outcome this merger will have upon us in the long term 
other common carrier traffic routed to us for termination in alaska is largely dependent on traffic routed to mci and sprint by their customers 
pricing pressures  new program offerings  business failures  and market and business consolidations continue to evolve in the markets served by mci and sprint 
if  as a result  their traffic is reduced  or if their competitors costs to terminate or originate traffic in alaska are reduced  our traffic will also likely be reduced  and our pricing may be reduced to respond to competitive pressures  consistent with federal law 
additionally  disruption in the economy resulting from terrorist attacks and other attacks or acts of war could affect our carrier customers 
we are unable to predict the effect on us of such changes  however given the materiality of other common carrier revenues to us  a significant reduction in traffic or pricing could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity

all current subscribers who have had calling activity during december and  respectively 
the decrease in message telephone service revenues from residential  commercial  and governmental customers in is primarily due to a decrease in the average rate per minute 
our average rate per minute decrease is primarily due to our promotion of and customers enrollment in calling plans offering a certain number of minutes for a flat monthly fee 
the decrease in message telephone service to residential  commercial and governmental customers in is partially off set by the following o increased minutes carried for these customers primarily due to our contract to provide services to the state of alaska starting in the first quarter of  and o an increase in the number of active residential  commercial  and governmental customers billed primarily due to our promotion of and our customers enrollment in a new bundled offering to our residential customers  partially off set by the effect of customers substituting cellular phone  prepaid calling card  and email usage for direct dial minutes 
broadband services revenue the increase in revenues from our packaged telecommunications offering to rural hospitals and health clinics and our schoolaccess tm offering to rural school districts in is primarily due to the following o an increased number of circuits leased to rural hospitals  health clinics  and rural school districts to both existing and a new customer resulting in increased revenue of million  and o a million increase in special project revenue for services sold to the federal government 
fiber optic cable system capacity lease revenue the increase in revenues from the lease of fiber optic cable system capacity is primarily due to a lease of capacity on the aulp east fiber optic cable system resulting in increased monthly revenue of approximately  starting in july long distance services segment cost of goods sold long distance services segment cost of goods sold increased to million in primarily due to the following o a increase in retail minutes carried  o a increase in wholesale minutes carried  and o a million refund million after deducting certain direct costs in from a local exchange carrier in respect of its earnings that exceeded regulatory requirements that did not recur in the increase in the long distance services segment cost of goods sold is partially off set by the following o in the course of business we estimate unbilled long distance services cost of goods sold based upon minutes of use processed through our network and established rates 
such estimates are revised when subsequent billings are received  payments are made  billing matters are researched and resolved  tariffed billing periods lapse  or when disputed charges are resolved 
our favorable adjustments decreased to million in from million in o reductions in access costs due to distribution and termination of our traffic on our own local access services network instead of paying other carriers to distribute and terminate our traffic 
the statewide average cost savings is approximately 
and 
per minute for interstate and intrastate traffic  respectively 
we expect cost savings to continue to occur as long distance traffic originated  carried  and terminated on our own facilities grows 
long distance services segment operating income long distance services segment operating income increased to million from to primarily due to the following o the increase in long distance services segment revenues to million in  o realization of approximately million of the mci credit through a reduction to bad debt expense in  as further discussed in the long distance service overview above 
we realized approximately million of the mci credit through a reduction to bad debt expense in  and o in  we reported an impairment charge of million representing the remaining net book value recorded for our north pacific cable asset as further described in the impairment charge section below 
the long distance services segment operating income increase was partially off set by the following o the increase in long distance services segment costs of goods sold to million in  as discussed above  o a increase in long distance services segment selling  general and administrative expenses to million primarily due to an approximately million increase in fiber repair expenses in compared to the increase in fiber repair expenses is the result of the repair of aulp east in july with a total repair cost of approximately  and the reversal of an accrual for estimated fiber repair costs of  in  and o a increase in long distance services segment depreciation  amortization and accretion expense to million in as compared to primarily due to our investment in long distance services segment equipment and facilities placed into service during the year ended december  for which a full year of depreciation was recorded in the year ended december   and our investment in long distance services segment equipment and facilities placed into service during the year ended december  for which a partial year of depreciation was recorded in the year ended december  cable services segment overview cable services segment revenues in represented of consolidated revenues 
our cable systems serve communities and areas in alaska  including the state s four largest population centers  anchorage  fairbanks  the mat su valley and juneau 
on february  we acquired all of the assets of barrow cable tv  inc bctv for approximately million 
we expect the bctv asset purchase to result in additional subscribers totaling approximately and additional homes passed totaling approximately  we generate cable services segment revenues from four primary sources digital and analog programming services  including monthly basic and premium subscriptions  pay per view movies and other one time events  such as sporting events  equipment rentals and installation  cable modem services shared with our internet services segment  and advertising sales

we distribute local anchorage broadcaster signals to all of our cable systems 
this local programming provides additional value to our cable subscribers that not all our dbs competitors can provide 
in the third quarter of dbs service provider dish network echostar communications corporation began providing  for an additional fee  anchorage based broadcaster programming in anchorage and in other alaska communities where there is not a similar local broadcast affiliate

if one entity purchases multiple cable modem service access points  each access point is counted as a subscriber 
total cable services segment revenues increased to million and average gross revenue per average basic subscriber per month increased or in the increase in cable services segment revenues is primarily due to the following o a increase in digital set top box rental revenue to million in primarily caused by the increased use of digital distribution technology  o a increase in its share of cable modem revenue offered through our internet services segment to million in due to an increased number of cable modems deployed 
approximately of our cable homes passed are able to subscribe to our cable modem service  and o a increase in advertising sales revenue to million in primarily caused by an increase in olympic and national and local political advertising 
cable services segment cost of goods sold increased to million in due to programming cost increases for most of our cable programming service offerings 
the increase in cable services segment cost of goods sold is partially off set by a refund received in from a supplier retroactive to august and arrangements with suppliers in which we received rebates in upon us meeting specified goals

local access services segment overview during local access services segment revenues represented of consolidated revenues 
we generate local access services segment revenues from three primary sources business and residential basic dial tone services  business private line and special access services  and business and residential features and other charges  including voice mail  caller id  distinctive ring  inside wiring and subscriber line charges 
the primary factors that contribute to year to year changes in local access services segment revenues include the average number of business and residential subscribers to our services during a given reporting period  the average monthly rates charged for non traffic sensitive services  the number and type of additional premium features selected  the traffic sensitive access rates charged to carriers and the universal service program 
our local access services segment faces significant competition in anchorage  fairbanks  and juneau from acs  which is the largest ilec in alaska  and from at t alascom  inc in anchorage for residential services 
we believe our approach to developing  pricing  and providing local access services and bundling different business segment services will allow us to be competitive in providing those services 
at december    lines were in service as compared to approximately  lines in service at december  we estimate that our lines in service represents a statewide market share of approximately 
a line in service is defined as a revenue generating circuit or channel connecting a customer to the public switched telephone network 
our access line mix at december  follows o residential lines represent approximately of our lines  o business customers represent approximately of our lines  and o internet access customers represent approximately of our lines 
in april we successfully launched our dlps deployment utilizing our anchorage coaxial cable facilities 
this service delivery method allows us to utilize our own cable facilities to provide local access service to our customers and avoid paying local loop charges to the ilec 
to ensure the necessary equipment is available to us  we have committed to purchase a certain number of outdoor  network powered multi media adapters 
at december  we had approximately  dlps lines in service 
we plan to continue to deploy additional dlps lines during the year ended december  approximately of our lines are provided on our own facilities and leased local loops 
approximately of our lines are provided using the une platform delivery method 
in january we applied to the rca to expand our existing certification for the provision of competitive local service 
we requested to provide service in competition with the existing service provider in five service areas which include the communities of ketchikan  cordova  chitina  glenallen  mccarthy  mentasta  tatitlek  valdez  delta junction  homer  kenai  kodiak  soldotna  nenana  north pole  and the area from eagle river to healy 
in addition  we have requested approval to offer local service in six areas covered by our cable facilities only which include the communities of wrangell  petersburg  sitka  seward  bethel  and nome 
we plan to offer service in these new areas using a combination of methods 
to a large extent  we plan to use our existing cable network to deliver local services 
where we do not have cable plant  we may use wireless technologies and resale of other carrier s services 
we may lease portions of an existing carrier s network or seek wholesale discounts  but our application is not dependent upon access to either unbundled network elements of the ilec s network or wholesale discount rates for resale of ilec services 
we have requested the rca decide this application within at least six months 
on june  the rca issued an order in our arbitration with acs to revise the rates  terms  and conditions that govern access to unes in the anchorage market 
the rca s ruling set rates for numerous elements of acs network  the most significant being the lease rate for local loops 
the order initially increased the loop rate from to per loop per month 
we immediately filed a petition for reconsideration with the rca to correct computational errors and raise other issues 
on august   the rca ruled on the petition and retroactively lowered the loop rate to per month 
we estimate the ruling  absent other measures would increase our local access services segment cost of goods sold by as much as approximately million during the year ended december  in january we appealed the rca ruling to the federal circuit court arguing that the pricing and methodology used by acs and approved by the rca was flawed and in violation of federal law 
we cannot predict at this time the outcome of the petition for reconsideration or the lawsuit 
in december we distributed our new anchorage phone directory and began recognizing revenue and cost of goods sold in the local access services segment 
we recognized one month of revenue and cost of goods sold in the fourth quarter of and the remaining eleven months of revenue and cost of goods sold were recognized in in december we distributed a second anchorage phone directory and are using the same recognition method for revenue and cost of goods sold 
in october we completed distribution of our new fairbanks and juneau area directories 
we recognized three months of revenue and cost of goods sold in and will recognize the remaining nine months of revenue and cost of goods sold in local access services segment revenues and cost of goods sold local access services segment revenues increased in to million primarily due to the following o growth in the number of lines in service from  to  o million increase to million in support from the universal service program  and o million increase in revenues to million from our phone directories 
the increase in local access services segment revenues is partially off set by access rate decreases 
local access services segment cost of goods sold increased to million in primarily due to the growth in the average number of lines in service and the increased costs resulting from the rca s anchorage une arbitration settlement order in june discussed above 
local access services segment operating loss local access services segment operating loss decreased to million from to primarily due to the revenue increase to million partially off set by the following o the increase in cost of goods sold to million  o a  increase in local services segment selling  general and administrative expenses to million  and o a increase in local services segment depreciation  amortization and accretion expense to million in as compared to primarily due to our investment in local access services segment equipment and facilities placed into service during the year ended december  for which a full year of depreciation was recorded in the year ended december   and our investment in local access services segment equipment and facilities placed into service during the year ended december  for which a partial year of depreciation was recorded in the year ended december  the local access services segment operating results are negatively affected by the allocation of the benefit of access cost savings to the long distance services segment 
if the local access services segment received credit for the access charge reductions recorded by the long distance services segment  the local access services segment operating loss would have improved by approximately million and the long distance services segment operating income would have been reduced by an equal amount in avoided access charges totaled approximately million in the amount of allocated access cost savings is affected by access rate decreases from to internet services segment overview during internet services segment revenues represented of consolidated revenues 
we generate internet services segment revenues from three primary sources access product services  including commercial  internet service provider  and retail dial up access  network management services  and internet services segment s allocable share of cable modem revenue a portion of cable modem revenue is also recognized by our cable services segment 
the primary factors that contribute to year to year changes in internet services segment revenues include the average number of subscribers to our services during a given reporting period  the average monthly subscription rates  the amount of bandwidth purchased by large commercial customers  and the number and type of additional premium features selected 
marketing campaigns continue to be deployed targeting residential and commercial customers featuring bundled products 
our internet offerings are bundled with various combinations of our long distance  cable  and local access services segments offerings and provide free or discounted basic or premium internet services 
value added premium internet features are available for additional charges

total internet services segment revenues increased to million in primarily due to the increase in its allocable share of cable modem revenues to million in as compared to the increase in cable modem revenues is primarily due to growth in cable modem subscribers 
internet services cost of goods sold increased to million in associated with increased internet services segment revenues 
internet services segment operating income internet services segment operating income increased to million from to primarily due to the increase in internet services segment revenues to million in partially off set by the increase in internet services segment cost of goods sold to million in  and a  increase in selling  general and administrative expenses to million 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is due to an approximately  increase in labor and employee benefits costs

as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in  primarily due to an increase in revenues without a corresponding increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
bad debt recovery bad debt recovery increased  to a net recovery of million in the increase is primarily due to realization of approximately million of the mci credit through a reduction to bad debt expense in  as further discussed in the long distance service overview above 
we realized approximately million of the mci credit through a reduction to bad debt expense in impairment charge in  we reported an impairment charge of million in our long distance services segment which equaled the remaining net book value recorded for our north pacific cable asset 
in we purchased one ds of capacity on a fiber optic cable system owned by at t 
this fiber optic cable system is a spur off of a trans pacific fiber optic cable system owned by another group 
we used our owned capacity to carry traffic to and from alaska and the lower states 
the section of the north pacific cable in which we owned capacity was taken out of service in january due to a billing dispute between at t and the owner of the trans pacific cable system causing us to re route certain of our traffic 
we were relieved of all future obligations required by our purchase agreement and ceased payment of maintenance and vessel standby costs totaling approximately  per year that would otherwise be payable over the remaining life of the system 
the aulp west fiber optic cable system we built was put into service in june and provides us with route diversity and redundancy in excess of that previously provided by the north pacific cable 
depreciation  amortization and accretion expense depreciation  amortization and accretion expense increased to million in the increase is primarily attributed to our million investment in equipment and facilities placed into service during for which a full year of depreciation was recorded in  and the million investment in equipment and facilities placed into service during for which a partial year of depreciation was recorded in other expense  net other expense  net of other income  decreased to million in primarily due to a million decrease in interest expense in on our new senior credit facility due to a decrease in the average outstanding balance owed on our new senior credit facility and a decreased average new senior credit facility interest rate as compared to partially offsetting the decreases described above were the following o in we paid bond call premiums totaling million to redeem our old senior notes  o as a result of redeeming our old senior notes in we recognized million in unamortized old senior notes fee expense  and o a million increase in interest expense on our new senior notes due to an increase in the outstanding balance owed  partially off set by a decreased interest rate in as compared to income tax expense income tax expense was million in and million in the change was due to increased net income before income taxes in as compared to and an approximately million increase in income tax expense resulting from a true up of the deferred tax assets and liabilities associated primarily with fixed assets and net operating loss carryforwards 
our effective income tax rate increased from in to in due to an adjustment of deferred tax assets and liabilities in at december   we have tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million that will begin expiring in if not utilized  and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of approximately million available to offset regular income taxes payable in future years 
we utilized net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million during the year ended december  our utilization of certain net operating loss carryforwards is subject to limitations pursuant to internal revenue code section tax benefits associated with recorded deferred tax assets are considered to be more likely than not realizable through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
the amount of deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced which would result in additional income tax expense 
we estimate that our effective annual income tax rate for financial statement purposes will be to in on october  the american jobs creation act of was signed into law 
we believe this new law will not have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on january  we adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no

the decrease in message telephone service revenues from residential  commercial  and governmental customers in is primarily due to the following o a decrease in minutes carried for these customers primarily due to the effect of customers substituting cellular phone  prepaid calling card and email usage for direct dial minutes  o a decrease in the average rate per minute primarily due to our promotion of and customers enrollment in calling plans offering a certain number of minutes for a flat monthly fee  and o a decrease in the number of active residential  commercial  and governmental customers billed primarily due to the effect of customers substituting cellular phone  prepaid calling card  and email usage for direct dial minutes 
broadband services revenue the increase in revenues from our packaged telecommunications offering to rural hospitals and health clinics and our schoolaccess tm offering to rural school districts in is primarily due to the following o our schoolaccess tm offering called distance learning service that started in late distance learning service is a video conference based service that enables eight school districts in alaska to provide additional educational opportunities for their students  and o an increased number of circuits leased to rural hospitals and health clinics in alaska 
long distance services segment cost of goods sold long distance services segment cost of goods sold decreased to million in primarily due to the following o reductions in access costs due to distribution and termination of our traffic on our own local access services network instead of paying other carriers to distribute and terminate our traffic 
the statewide average cost savings is approximately 
and 
per minute for interstate and intrastate traffic  respectively 
we expect cost savings to continue to occur as long distance traffic originated  carried  and terminated on our own facilities grows  o the fcc multi association group reform order reducing the interstate access rates paid by interexchange carriers to lecs beginning july o a million refund million after deducting certain direct costs in from a local exchange carrier in respect of its earnings that exceeded regulatory requirements  and o a million refund in from an intrastate access cost pool that previously overcharged us for access services 
the decrease in the long distance services segment cost of goods sold is partially off set by increased costs associated with additional transponder and network back up capacity in as compared to long distance services segment operating income long distance services segment operating income increased to million from to primarily due to the following o the decrease in long distance services segment cost of goods sold to million in  o an increase of to a net bad debt recovery of million in due to realization of approximately million of the mci credit through a reduction to bad debt expense in  as further discussed in the long distance service overview above 
we recognized bad debt expense of approximately million due to the mci bankruptcy in  and o a decrease in long distance services segment depreciation  amortization and accretion expense to million in as compared to primarily due to a reduction of million in depreciation expense associated with a portion of the kanas telecom  inc acquisition included in the long distance services segment partially off set by our investment in long distance services segment equipment and facilities placed into service during the year ended december  for which a full year of depreciation was recorded in the year ended december   and our investment in long distance services segment equipment and facilities placed into service during the year ended december  for which a partial year of depreciation was recorded in the year ended december  the long distance services segment operating income increase was partially off set by the following o the decrease in long distance services segment revenue to million in  as discussed above  o in  we reported an impairment charge of million which equaled the remaining net book value recorded for our north pacific cable asset as further described in the impairment charge section below  and o a increase in long distance services segment selling  general and administrative expenses to million primarily due to an increase of approximately for labor and employee benefit costs and the reversal of an accrual for estimated fiber repair costs  in cable services segment overview cable television revenues in represented of consolidated revenues

effective february  we increased rates charged for certain cable services and premium packages in six communities  including three of the state s four largest population centers  anchorage  fairbanks and juneau 
rates increased approximately for those customers who experienced an adjustment 
in the second quarter of we signed seven year retransmission agreements with the five local anchorage broadcasters and began up linking and distributing the local anchorage broadcaster signals to all of our cable systems 
this local programming provides additional value to our cable subscribers that not all our dbs competitors can provide 
in dbs service provider dish network echostar communications corporation began providing  for an additional fee  anchorage based broadcaster programming in anchorage and in other alaska communities where there is not a similar local broadcast affiliate

the increase in programming services revenue is partially off set by a decrease in basic subscribers due to increased competition from dbs 
the cable services segment s share of cable modem revenue offered through our internet services segment increased to million in due to an increased number of cable modems deployed 
approximately of our cable homes passed are able to subscribe to our cable modem service 
in the second quarter of we completed our upgrade of the ketchikan cable system 
customers in this system are able to subscribe to cable modem service 
at december  we offered digital programming service in anchorage  the mat su valley  fairbanks  juneau  ketchikan  kenai  and soldotna  representing approximately of our total homes passed 
we launched digital programming services in the mat su valley and ketchikan cable systems in cable services cost of goods sold increased to million in due to programming cost increases for most of our cable programming services offerings 
cable services segment operating income cable services segment operating income increased million to million from to primarily due to the increase in cable services segment revenues to million in  partially off set by the following o the increase in cable services segment costs of goods sold to million in  as described above  o a million increase in cable services segment selling  general and administrative expenses to million primarily due to an increase of approximately  in labor and employee benefits costs and an increase of approximately  in promotion expenses  and o a increase in cable services segment depreciation  amortization and accretion expense to million in as compared to primarily due to our investment in cable services segment equipment and facilities placed into service during the year ended december  for which a full year of depreciation was recorded in the year ended december   and our investment in cable services segment equipment and facilities placed into service during the year ended december  for which a partial year of depreciation was recorded in the year ended december  mso operating statistics our operating statistics include capital expenditures and customer information from our cable services segment and the components of our local access services and internet services segments which offer services utilizing our cable services facilities

local access services segment overview during local access services segment revenues represented of consolidated revenues 
we began providing service in the juneau market in the first quarter of at december    lines were in service as compared to approximately  lines in service at december  at december  approximately  additional lines were awaiting connection 
we estimate that our lines in service total represents a statewide market share of approximately 
our access line mix at december  follows o residential lines represent approximately of our lines  o business customers represent approximately of our lines  and o internet access customers represent approximately of our lines 
approximately of our lines are provided on our own facilities and leased local loops 
approximately of our lines are provided using une platform 
in december we distributed our new phone directory and began recognizing revenue and costs of sales and service in the local access services segment 
we recognized one month of revenue and cost of sales and service in the fourth quarter of and the remaining eleven months in operating expenses incurred and recognized throughout to prepare our new phone directory are reported in the local access services segment 
local access services segment revenues and cost of goods sold local access services segment revenues increased in to million primarily due to the following o growth in the lines in service  o million of support from the universal service program  and o a change in how we provision local access lines in fairbanks and juneau 
in we primarily resold service purchased from acs 
in we benefited from our facilities build out with an increased number of access lines provisioned on our own facilities using unes  allowing us to collect interstate and intrastate access revenues 
local access services segment cost of goods sold increased to million in primarily due to the growth in the average number of lines in service 
local access services segment operating loss local access services segment operating loss decreased to million from to primarily due to the revenue increase to million partially off set by the following o the increase in cost of goods sold to million  and o a million increase in local services segment selling  general and administrative expenses to million primarily due to an approximately  increase in costs associated with state of alaska regulatory affairs 
the local access services segment operating results are negatively affected by the allocation of the benefit of access cost savings to the long distance services segment 
if the local access services segment received credit for the access charge reductions recorded by the long distance services segment  the local access services segment operating results would have improved by approximately million and the long distance services segment operating results would have been reduced by an equal amount in avoided access charges totaled approximately million in the local access services segment operating results in were affected by our evaluation and testing of digital local phone service and internet protocol based technology to deliver phone service through our cable facilities 
internet services segment overview during internet services segment revenues represented of consolidated revenues 
internet services segment revenues and cost of goods sold selected key performance indicators for our internet services segment follow percentage change total internet subscribers   cable modem subscribers   dial up subscribers   total internet services segment revenues increased to million in primarily due to the increase in its allocable share of cable modem revenues to million in as compared to the increase in cable modem revenues is primarily due to growth in cable modem subscribers and the termination in the first quarter of of our offering in which customers received up to two months of free cable modem service 
additionally  the growth in cable modem revenues is affected by the level of service our subscribers select 
in and  and  respectively  of our subscribers selected our highest level of cable modem service resulting in increased revenue of approximately  in as compared to we previously reported a total of  internet subscribers at december  this subscriber count was based upon the total number of active dial up subscribers at december  not all cable modem subscribers paying for a dial up plan have activated their dial up service 
when we first started selling cable modem service it was packaged in a way that almost all cable modem subscribers were also dial up subscribers 
as we introduced new packages and plans and started promoting our cable modem litespeed service the number of cable modem subscribers without a dial up plan increased substantially 
an internal review during the second quarter of revealed that these subscriber counts had risen substantially enough that they are now being reported separately 
internet services cost of goods sold increased to million in primarily due to the increased number of cable modems deployed 
internet services segment operating income internet services segment operating income increased to million from to primarily due to the increase in internet services segment revenues to million in partially off set by the increase in internet services segment cost of goods sold to million in all other services overview revenues included in the all other category represented of total revenues in all other revenues and cost of goods sold all other revenues increased to million in the increase in revenues is primarily due to the following o increased monthly revenue earned in as compared to from our gci fiber system that transits the trans alaska oil pipeline corridor  and o million in special project revenue earned from our gci fiber system in all other costs of sales and services increased to million in primarily due to increased costs associated with the increased monthly revenue from our gci fiber system 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in and  as a percentage of total revenues  increased to in from in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily due to a million increase in labor and health insurance costs and a million increase in the accrual for company wide success sharing bonus costs 
bad debt expense recovery bad debt expense recovery decreased to  in the decrease is primarily due to the following o utilization of approximately million of the mci credit as a reduction to bad debt expense in  and o provision in of a million bad debt reserve for uncollected amounts due from mci 
impairment charge in  we reported an impairment charge of million which equaled the remaining net book value recorded for our north pacific cable asset 
in we purchased one ds of capacity on a fiber optic cable system owned by at t 
this fiber optic cable system is a spur off of a trans pacific fiber optic cable system owned by another group 
we used our owned capacity to carry traffic to and from alaska and the lower states 
the section of the north pacific cable in which we owned capacity was taken out of service in january due to a billing dispute between at t and the owner of the trans pacific cable system causing us to re route certain of our traffic 
our aulp west fiber optic cable system provides us with route diversity and redundancy in excess of that previously provided by the north pacific cable 
depreciation  amortization and accretion expense depreciation  amortization and accretion expense decreased to million in the decrease is primarily attributed to a reduction in the depreciable value of property and equipment due to a basis adjustment of million which was recorded in associated with the kanas telecom  inc acquisition  and a reduction of million in depreciation expense which was also associated with the acquisition 
the decrease in depreciation  amortization and accretion expense described above was partially off set by an increase in depreciation expense due to our million investment in equipment and facilities placed into service during for which a full year of depreciation was recorded in  and the million investment in equipment and facilities placed into service during for which a partial year of depreciation was recorded in other expense  net other expense  net of other income  increased to million in the increase is primarily due to the following o we recognized approximately million in amortization of loan and senior notes fees in because a portion of the new senior credit facility was a substantial modification of the april  amended senior credit facility  o increased interest expense due to increased interest rates on our amended senior credit facility from november through october  when the amended senior credit facility was replaced with the new senior credit facility  o increased amortization of loan fees due to additional loan fees incurred to amend our senior credit facility  and o a million interest benefit earned in from an interest rate swap agreement which was called at no cost by the counter party and terminated on august  partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in the average outstanding indebtedness in and decreased interest expense in november and december due to the decreased interest rate paid on our new senior credit facility 
income tax expense income tax expense was million in and million in the change was due to increased net income before income taxes and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in as compared to our effective income tax rate decreased from in to in due to the effect of items that are nondeductible for income tax purposes and adjustments made to ending temporary difference balances in cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on january  we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  and recorded the cumulative effect of accretion and depreciation expense as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of approximately  net of income tax benefit of  fluctuations in fourth quarter results of operations the following is a summary of unaudited quarterly results of operations for the years ended december  and amounts in thousands  except per share amounts first second third fourth total quarter quarter quarter quarter year total revenues      operating income      net income      basic net income per common share diluted net income per common share total revenues      operating income      net income before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle      net income      basic and diluted net income per common share net income before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net of income tax benefit of net income due to rounding  the sum of quarterly net income per common share amounts does not agree to total year net income per common share

in the first and second quarters of we recognized no recoveries of bad debt expense for uncollected accounts due from mci 
in the third and fourth quarters of we recognized approximately  and million  respectively  in recoveries of bad debt expense for uncollected accounts due from mci  o in the fourth quarter of we recognized an approximately million increase in income tax expense resulting from a true up of the deferred tax assets and liabilities associated primarily with fixed assets and net operating loss carryforwards  o in the fourth quarter of we reported an impairment charge of million which equaled the remaining net book value recorded for our north pacific cable asset  as discussed in impairment charge above  and o in the fourth quarter of we recognized approximately million in amortization of loan and senior notes fees due to classifying a portion of the new senior credit facility as a substantial modification of the april  amended senior credit facility 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities totaled million in as compared to million in the increase is primarily due to increased cash flow from all of our reportable segments and a million increase in the mci credit recovery  as further discussed in the long distance service overview above  partially off set by decreased cash flow from all other services  a million payment of our company wide success sharing bonus in  and a million refund in from a local exchange carrier in respect of its earnings that exceeded regulatory requirements 
other sources of cash during include million from the issuance of our new senior notes  draws of million under the revolving credit portion of our new senior credit facility  million from the issuance of our class a common stock  and million in payments of notes receivable from related parties

the  statute mile cable system has a total design capacity of gigabits per second access speed 
the cable complements our existing fiber optic cable system between whittier  alaska and seattle  washington 
the two cables provide physically diverse backup to each other in the event of an outage 
during our capital expenditures for this project have totaled approximately million  and from inception have totaled million  most of which have been funded through our operating cash flows 
planned capital expenditures over the next five years include those necessary for continued expansion of our long distance  local exchange and internet facilities  supplementing our existing network backup facilities  continuing deployment of dlps  and upgrades to and expansions of our cable television plant 
in april we successfully launched our dlps service delivery method

we are unable to predict the outcome this merger will have on us in the long term 
in february verizon communications  inc agreed to purchase mci 
the agreement requires approval of shareholders and anti trust regulators 
we are unable to predict the outcome this merger will have on us in the long term  however given the materiality of mci s revenues to us  a significant reduction in traffic or pricing could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
a migration of mci s or sprint s traffic off our network without it being replaced by other common carriers that interconnect with our network could have a materially adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
dividends accrued on our series b preferred stock are payable in cash at the semi annual payment dates of april and october of each year 
we paid dividends of  and  on april  and october   respectively 
our next series b preferred stock dividend is due april  redemption is required on april  in january   shares of our series b preferred stock was converted to  shares of our class a common stock at the stated conversion price of per share 
in august   shares of our series b preferred stock was converted to  shares of our class a common stock at the stated conversion price of per share 
in november   shares of our series b preferred stock was converted to  shares of our class a common stock at the stated conversion price of per share 
the conversions will reduce our future semi annual cash dividends 
gci s board of directors has authorized a common stock buyback program for the repurchase of our class a and class b common stock 
our board of directors authorized us and we obtained permission from our lenders and preferred shareholder to repurchase up to million per quarter during the third and fourth quarters of the repurchase of mci s  shares of our class a common stock using proceeds from our december senior notes offering was not part of our buyback program 
during the year ended december  we have repurchased  shares of our class a common stock at a cost of approximately million through our buyback program 
our board of directors authorized us and we obtained permission from our lenders and preferred shareholder for up to million of repurchases during the six month period ended june  during the months of january and february we repurchased  shares of our class a common stock at a cost of approximately million 
we expect to continue the repurchases throughout subject to the availability of free cash flow  credit facilities  the price of our class a and class b common stock and the requisite consents of our lenders and preferred shareholder 
the repurchases will comply with the restrictions of sec rule b the long distance  local access  cable  internet and wireless services industries continue to experience substantial competition  regulatory uncertainty  and continuing technological changes 
our future results of operations will be affected by our ability to react to changes in the competitive and regulatory environment and by our ability to fund and implement new or enhanced technologies 
we are unable to determine how competition  economic conditions  and regulatory and technological changes will affect our ability to obtain financing under acceptable terms and conditions 
we believe that we will be able to meet our current and long term liquidity and capital requirements  fixed charges and preferred stock dividends through our cash flows from operating activities  existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  credit facilities  and other external financing and equity sources 
should cash flows be insufficient to support additional borrowings and principal payments scheduled under our existing credit facilities  capital expenditures will likely be reduced 
critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
the financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions  which are integral to understanding reported results 
critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require management to make estimates that are difficult  subjective or complex 
most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies 
several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements 
these factors include  among other things  whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements  the nature of the estimates  the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including third parties or available prices  and sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies with our audit committee 
those policies considered to be critical accounting policies for the year ended december  are described below 
o we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our assessment of the likelihood that our customers will satisfactorily comply with rules necessary to obtain supplemental funding from the universal service administration company usac for services provided by us under our packaged communications offerings to rural hospitals  health clinics and school districts 
we base our estimates on the aging of our accounts receivable balances  financial health of specific customers  regional economic data  changes in our collections process  our customers compliance with usac rules  and our historical write off experience  net of recoveries 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if they are unable to emerge from reorganization proceedings  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
if their financial condition improves or they emerge successfully from reorganization proceedings  allowances may be reduced 
such allowance changes could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
o we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill and other intangibles  at fair value as required by sfas no 
 business combinations 
goodwill and indefinite lived assets such as our cable certificates are not amortized but are subject  at a minimum  to annual tests for impairment and quarterly evaluations of whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life as required by sfas no 
other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method  and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount as required by sfas no 
the initial goodwill and other intangibles recorded and subsequent impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of the applicability of quoted market prices in active markets and  if quoted market prices are not available and or are not applicable  how the acquired asset will perform in the future using a discounted cash flow analysis 
estimated cash flows may extend beyond ten years and  by their nature  are difficult to determine over an extended timeframe 
events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include  among others  competitive forces  customer behaviors and attrition  changes in revenue growth trends  cost structures and technology  and changes in discount rates  performance compared to peers  material and ongoing negative economic trends  and specific industry or market sector conditions 
in determining the reasonableness of cash flow estimates  we review historical performance of the underlying asset or similar assets in an effort to improve assumptions utilized in our estimates 
in assessing the fair value of goodwill and other intangibles  we may consider other information to validate the reasonableness of our valuations including third party assessments 
these evaluations could result in a change in useful lives in future periods and could result in write down of the value of intangible assets 
the sec staff announcement issued on september  requires us to value our indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill using the direct value method for impairment testing purposes no later than january  our cable certificate assets are our only indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill and were originally valued and recorded using the residual method 
because of the significance of the identified intangible assets and goodwill to our consolidated balance sheet  our annual impairment analysis pursuant to the sec staff announcement and quarterly evaluation of remaining useful life will be critical 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  changes in market conditions or other externalities  or recognition of previously unrecognized intangible assets for impairment testing purposes could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
refer to note m in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the sec staff announcement and intangible assets  respectively 
o we estimate unbilled long distance services segment cost of goods sold based upon minutes of use carried through our network and established rates 
we estimate unbilled costs for new circuits and services  and when network changes occur that result in traffic routing changes or a change in carriers 
carriers that provide service to us regularly make network changes that can lead to new  revised or corrected billings 
such estimates are revised or removed when subsequent billings are received  payments are made  billing matters are researched and resolved  tariffed billing periods lapse  or when disputed charges are resolved 
revisions to previous estimates could either increase or decrease costs in the year in which the estimate is revised which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
o our income tax policy provides for deferred income taxes to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we have recorded deferred tax assets of approximately million associated with income tax net operating losses that were generated from to  and that expire from to pre acquisition income tax net operating losses associated with acquired companies are subject to additional deductibility limits 
we have recorded deferred tax assets of approximately million associated with alternative minimum tax credits that do not expire 
significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that may be required against the deferred tax assets 
in conjunction with certain acquisitions  we determined that approximately million of the acquired net operating losses would not be utilized for income tax purposes  and elected with our december  income tax returns to forego utilization of such acquired losses 
deferred tax assets were not recorded associated with the foregone losses and  accordingly  no valuation allowance was provided 
we utilized approximately million of our tax net operating loss carryforwards in we have not recorded a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets as of december  based on management s belief that future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and estimated future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  will  more likely than not  be sufficient to realize the benefit of these assets over time 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or if our historical trends change  we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
policies related to revenue recognition and financial instruments require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
certain of these matters are among topics currently under reexamination by accounting standards setters and regulators 
no specific conclusions reached by these standard setters appear likely to cause a material change in our accounting policies  although outcomes cannot be predicted with confidence 
a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  requiring all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments including employee stock options at fair value 
sfas no 
r is effective for public companies for interim or annual periods beginning after june  as of july   all public entities will apply sfas no 
r using a modified version of prospective application 
under that transition method  compensation cost is recognized on or after july  for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under sfas for either recognition or pro forma disclosures 
we estimate the application of sfas no 
r will result in an increase in our compensation cost for all share based payments of approximately million during the year ended december  in december  the fasb issued sfas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets  which amends accounting principle board apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
the guidance in apb opinion no 
is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in that opinion  however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
sfas no 
amends apb opinion no 
to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
we will adopt this statement july  and do not expect it to have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in november  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force eitf with respect to eitf issue no 
 applying the conditions in paragraph of fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  in determining whether to report discontinued operations 
a number of issues have arisen in practice in applying the criteria in paragraph  and the following broad categories of issues related to the application of both criteria in that paragraph have been identified a whether the intent of the paragraph is that all operations and cash flows of the disposal component be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity or whether some minor level of operations or cash flows may remain  b if some insignificant level of operations or cash flows of the disposal component can continue without precluding discontinued operations reporting  the level at which significance should be measured  and c in applying the paragraph  the factors to consider in determining whether the selling entity has retained significant continuing involvement in the disposed component 
at december  we do not have a component that has been identified for disposal 
we will adopt this eitf january  and do not expect it to have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in november  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the eitf with respect to eitf issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share 
this issue addresses when contingently convertible instruments should be included in diluted earnings per share 
for purposes of this issue  contingently convertible instruments are instruments that have embedded conversion features that are contingently convertible or exercisable based on a a market price trigger or b multiple contingencies if one of the contingencies is a market price trigger and the instrument can be converted or share settled based on meeting the specified market condition 
a market price trigger is a market condition that is based at least in part on the issuer s own share price 
examples of contingently convertible instruments subject to this issue include contingently convertible debt  contingently convertible preferred stock  and instrument c in eitf issue no 
 convertible bonds with issuer option to settle for cash upon conversion  all with embedded market price triggers 
the eitf decided that contingently convertible instruments should be included in diluted earnings per share if dilutive regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met 
additionally  the consensus should be applied to instruments that have multiple contingencies if one of the contingencies is a market price trigger and the instrument is convertible or can be settled in shares based on meeting a market condition that is  the conversion is not dependent or no longer dependent on a substantive non market based contingency 
at december  we do not have any contingently convertible instruments 
we will adopt this eitf january  and do not expect it to have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
geographic concentration and the alaska economy we offer voice and data telecommunication and video services to customers primarily throughout alaska 
because of this geographic concentration  growth of our business and of our operations depends upon economic conditions in alaska 
the economy of alaska is dependent upon the natural resource industries  and in particular oil production  as well as investment earnings  tourism  government  and united states military spending 
any deterioration in these markets could have an adverse impact on us 
all of the federal funding and the majority of investment revenues are dedicated for specific purposes  leaving oil revenues as the primary source of general operating revenues 
in fiscal the state s actual results indicate that alaska s oil revenues  federal funding and investment revenues supplied  and  respectively  of the state s total revenues 
in fiscal state economists forecast that alaska s oil revenues  federal funding and investment revenues will supply  and  respectively  of the state s total projected revenues 
the volume of oil transported by the transalaska oil pipeline system over the past years has been as high as million barrels per day in fiscal production has been declining over the last several years with an average of million barrels produced per day in fiscal the state forecasts the production rate to decline from million barrels produced per day in fiscal to million barrels produced per day in fiscal market prices for north slope oil averaged in fiscal and are forecasted to average in fiscal the closing price per barrel was on february  to the extent that actual oil prices vary materially from the state s projected prices the state s projected revenues and deficits will change 
when the price of oil is greater than per barrel and production of oil is between and million barrels per day  every change in the price per barrel of oil is forecasted to result in a million to million change in the state s fiscal revenue 
the production policy of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and its ability to continue to act in concert represents a key uncertainty in the state s revenue forecast 
the state of alaska maintains the constitutional budget reserve fund that is intended to fund budgetary shortfalls 
if the state s current projections are realized  the constitutional budget reserve fund will be depleted in the date the constitutional budget reserve fund is depleted is highly influenced by the price of oil 
if the fund is depleted  aggressive state action will be necessary to increase revenues and reduce spending in order to balance the budget 
the governor of the state of alaska and the alaska legislature continue to evaluate cost cutting and revenue enhancing measures 
should new oil discoveries or developments not materialize or the price of oil become depressed  the long term trend of continued decline in oil production from the prudhoe bay area is inevitable with a corresponding adverse impact on the economy of the state  in general  and on demand for telecommunications and cable television services  and  therefore  on us  in particular 
periodically there are renewed efforts to allow exploration and development in the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr 
the united states energy information agency estimates it could take nine years to begin oil field drilling after approval of anwr exploration 
deployment of a natural gas pipeline from the state of alaska s north slope to the lower states has been proposed to supplement natural gas supplies 
a competing natural gas pipeline through canada has also been proposed 
the economic viability of a natural gas pipeline depends upon the price of and demand for natural gas 
either project could have a positive impact on the state of alaska s revenues and could provide a substantial stimulus to the alaska economy 
in october both houses of congress passed and the president signed legislation allowing loan guarantees of up to billion  certain favorable income tax provisions and tax credits  and expedited permitting and judicial review for the construction of an alaska natural gas pipeline 
to support the construction of a natural gas pipeline  the governor of the state of alaska has announced that he believes the state must assume some level of shipper risk  serve as an equity partner or both 
the state of alaska is actively negotiating two applications to construct a natural gas pipeline 
the governor of the state of alaska has indicated his desire to submit a contract from one or more of these groups to the alaska legislature during the legislative session beginning in january development of the ballistic missile defense system may have a significant impact on alaskan communication requirements and the alaska economy 
the system is a fixed  land based  non nuclear missile defense system with a land and space based detection system capable of responding to limited strategic ballistic missile threats to the united states 
the system includes deployment of up to ground based interceptor silos and battle management command and control facilities at fort greely  alaska 
the united states army corps of engineers awarded a construction contract in for test bed facilities 
the contract is reported to contain basic requirements and various options that could amount to million in construction  or possibly more  if all items are executed 
construction began on the fort greely test bed in the first ground based missile interceptor was placed in an underground silo in july and a total of eight were in place at the end of the missile defense agency is reported to expect to have activated the first missile interceptors in tourism  air cargo  and service sectors have helped offset the prevailing pattern of oil industry downsizing that has occurred during much of the last several years 
we have  since our entry into the telecommunication marketplace  aggressively marketed our services to seek a larger share of the available market 
the customer base in alaska is limited  however  with a population of approximately  people 
the state of alaska s population is distributed as follows o are located in the municipality of anchorage  o are located in the fairbanks north star borough  o are located in the mat su borough  o are located in the kenai peninsula borough  o are located in the city and borough of juneau  and o the remaining are located in other communities across the state of alaska 
no assurance can be given that the driving forces in the alaska economy  and in particular  oil production  will continue at appropriate levels to provide an environment for expanded economic activity 
no assurance can be given that oil companies doing business in alaska will be successful in discovering new fields or further developing existing fields which are economic to develop and produce oil with access to the pipeline or other means of transport to market  even with a reduced level of royalties 
we are not able to predict the effect of changes in the price and production volumes of north slope oil on alaska s economy or on us 
seasonality long distance revenues primarily those derived from our other common carrier customers have historically been highest in the summer months because of temporary population increases attributable to tourism and increased seasonal economic activity such as construction  commercial fishing  and oil and gas activities 
cable television revenues are higher in the winter months because consumers spend more time at home and tend to watch more television during these months 
local access and internet services do not exhibit significant seasonality 
our ability to implement construction projects is also hampered during the winter months because of cold temperatures  snow and short daylight hours 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources 
schedule of certain known contractual obligations the following table details future projected payments associated with our certain known contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period more less than to to than total year years years years amounts in thousands long term debt    interest on long term debt      capital lease obligations  including interest     operating lease commitments      redeemable preferred stock   purchase obligations     total contractual obligations      for long term debt included in the above table  we have included principal payments on our new senior credit facility and on our new senior notes 
interest on amounts outstanding under our new senior credit facility is based on variable rates and therefore the amount is not determinable 
our new senior notes require semi annual interest payments of million through august for a discussion of our long term debt see note to the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
for a discussion of our capital and operating leases  see note to the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have included only the maturity redemption amount on our series b preferred stock cash dividends are excluded

dividends are payable semi annually at the rate of  plus accrued but unpaid dividends  in cash 
mandatory redemption is required years from the date of closing 
for more information about our redeemable preferred stock  see note e to the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
purchase obligations include the remaining dlps equipment purchase commitment of million and the remaining million commitment for our alaska airlines agreement as further described in note to the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements and a  maintenance contract commitment 
the contracts associated with these commitments are non cancelable 
purchase obligations also includes open purchase orders for goods and services for capital projects and normal operations totaling million which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets at december   because the goods had not been received or the services had not been performed at december  the open purchase orders are cancelable 
regulatory developments you should see part i item business  regulation  franchise authorizations and tariffs for more information about regulatory developments affecting us 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has a significant effect on our operations 
audit committee the audit committee  composed entirely of independent directors  meets periodically with our independent auditors and management to review the company s financial statements and the results of audit activities 
the audit committee  in turn  reports to the board of directors on the results of its review and recommends the selection of independent auditors 
the audit committee has approved the independent auditor to provide the following services o audit audit of financial statements filed with the sec  quarterly reviews  comfort letters  consents  review of registration statements  accounting consultations  o audit related employee benefit plan audits and accounting consultation on proposed transactions  o income tax services review of corporate and partnership income tax returns  and consultations regarding income tax matters  and o professional services planning  scoping and documentational assistance of internal controls over financial reporting 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business  including the impact of interest rate changes 
we do not hold derivatives for trading purposes 
our new senior credit facility carries interest rate risk 
amounts borrowed under this agreement bear interest at libor plus or less depending upon our total leverage ratio as defined 
should the libor rate change  our interest expense will increase or decrease accordingly 
as of december   we have borrowed million subject to interest rate risk 
on this amount  a increase in the interest rate would result in  in additional gross interest cost on an annualized basis 
the interest rate swap agreement to convert million of variable interest rate debt to fixed rate debt plus applicable margin terminated on september  our satellite transponder capital lease carries interest rate risk 
amounts borrowed under this agreement bear interest at libor plus 
should the libor rate change  our interest expense will increase or decrease accordingly 
as of december   we have borrowed million subject to interest rate risk 
on this amount  a increase in the interest rate would result in  in additional gross interest cost on an annualized basis
