our segments during  our operations were organized into four reportable segments as follows wireless networks our wireless networks segment provides communications network solutions that enable our wireless service provider customers to offer their customers  the subscribers for wireless communication services  the ability to be mobile while they send and receive voice and data communications using wireless devices  such as cellular telephones  personal digital assistants and other computing and communications devices 
our wireless networks segment consists of code division multiple access  or cdma  global system for mobile communications  or gsm  time division multiple access  or tdma  and universal mobile telecommunications systems  or umts  products 
enterprise networks our enterprise networks segment provides data  voice and multimedia communications solutions to our enterprise customers 
our enterprise networks customers consist of a broad range of enterprise customers around the world  including large businesses and their branch offices  small businesses and home offices  as well as government agencies  educational and other institutions and utility organizations 
our enterprise networks segment consists of i circuit and packet voice solutions and ii data networking and security solutions 

table of contents wireline networks our wireline networks segment provides data  voice and multimedia communications solutions to service providers that operate wireline networks 
our service provider customers include local and long distance telephone companies  wireless service providers  cable operators and other communication service providers 
our wireline networks segment consists of i circuit and packet voice solutions and ii data networking and security solutions 
optical networks our optical networks segment solutions transport data  voice and multimedia communications within and between cities  countries or continents by transmitting communications signals in the form of light waves through fiber optic cables 
our optical networks customers include local and long distance telephone companies  wireless service providers  cable operators and other communications service providers 
our optical networks segment consists of long haul and metropolitan optical products 
commencing in the second quarter of  the primary financial measure used by the chief executive officer  or ceo  in assessing performance and allocating resources to the segments was management earnings loss before income taxes  or management ebt 
this measure includes the cost of revenues  selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expense  r d expense  interest expense  other income expense net  minority interests net of tax and equity in net loss of associated companies net of tax 
effective october   we established a new streamlined organizational structure that included  among other things  combining the businesses of our four reportable segments into two business organizations i carrier networks and global operations  and ii enterprise networks 
we have reviewed the impact of these changes on our reportable segments and concluded that  although certain structural changes were made to reflect this reorganization effective october   we did not meet the criteria to change our reportable segments under statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information for the fiscal year 
our operating results on a segmented basis for the new business organizations were not available for review by our chief operating decision maker  as a significant amount of our finance resources were allocated to our restatement activity discussed in greater detail under developments in and 
these two business organizations include four operating segments 
the four operating segments are carrier packet networks  which is substantially an amalgamation of our previous wireline networks and optical networks businesses  cdma networks  which was previously part of wireless networks  gsm and umts networks which was also previously part of wireless networks  and enterprise networks  which remains substantially unchanged from the previous organization 
for the first quarter of these four operating segments will become our reportable segments 
our business environment in  there was increased spending in the industry compared to by both service provider and enterprise customers as certain service provider customers began to expand and upgrade their existing networks  including next generation wireless technologies and voip solutions 
this increase in industry spending was strongest with the build out of new technologies in both established and emerging markets and with the build out of traditional technologies in emerging markets 
in  we expect that these trends will continue  however  the rate of increase may be slower 
although there was increased spending in the industry by both service provider and enterprise customers in  we experienced a decline in revenue compared to there was decreased spending on our overall traditional technologies as customers continued to transition to next generation technologies 
this decreased spending on traditional technologies outpaced the increased spending on new technologies with many of our customers realigning capital spending with their current levels of earnings in order to maximize their return on invested capital 
also  excess network capacity and competition continued to exist in the industry  which led to continued pricing pressures on the sale of certain of our products 
however  based on current customer orders in emerging markets  particularly in asia and the caribbean and latin america region  or cala  and increased deployments of voip and next generation wireless technologies  including umts  we believe that we are well positioned to grow our revenues in for example  throughout and into we announced several new contracts across all of our reportable segments  but primarily in our wireless networks segment  as certain service provider customers began to expand and upgrade their existing networks and new network build outs were started in emerging markets 
in  we expect increased consolidation of certain service providers  particularly in the us we expect this trend to result in a net reduction in customer spending as these service providers focus on improving the efficiency of their combined networks rather than network expansion 
competition in the industry remains strong and our traditional large competitors  newer competitors  particularly from china  and certain smaller niche competitors continue to increase their market share and create pricing and margin pressures 
we and our competitors remain focused on certain key factors such as customer relationships  installed networks  innovative and reliable products  services and price 

table of contents as first announced on august   we put in place a new strategic plan that recognizes our business environment and the evolution of the converged network see business overview our strategic plan and outlook 
we are currently in a challenging transitional period as we implement the new strategic plan 
in an increasingly cost competitive environment  we are taking steps that we believe will better position us to grow market share and improve our results and cash generation 
as part of our strategic plan  we also announced a focused workforce reduction of approximately  employees 
over the last five years  we have divested most of our manufacturing activities to electronic manufacturing services  or ems  suppliers 
on june   we announced an agreement with flextronics international ltd  or flextronics  regarding the divestiture of substantially all of our remaining manufacturing operations 
we believe that the use of an outsourced manufacturing model has enabled us to benefit from leading manufacturing technologies  leverage existing resources from around the world  lower our cost of revenues  quickly adjust to fluctuations in market demand and decrease our investment in plant  equipment and inventories 
we continue to retain in house all strategic management and overall control responsibilities associated with our various supply chains  including all customer interfaces  customer service  order management  quality assurance  product cost management  new product introduction  and network solutions integration  testing and fulfillment 
in may  we commenced certain balance sheet reviews at the direction of certain members of former management that led to a comprehensive review and analysis of our assets and liabilities  or the comprehensive review  which resulted in the restatement effected in december of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and and for the quarters ended march  and june   or the first restatement 
in late october  the audit committees of our and nnl s boards of directors  or the audit committee  initiated an independent review of the facts and circumstances leading to the first restatement  or the independent review  and engaged the law firm now known as wilmer cutler pickering hale dorr llp  or wcphd  to advise it in connection with the independent review 
the audit committee sought to gain a full understanding of the events that caused significant excess liabilities to be maintained on the balance sheet that needed to be restated  and to recommend that our board of directors adopt  and direct management to implement  necessary remedial measures to address personnel  controls  compliance and discipline 
in january  the audit committee reported the findings of the independent review  together with its recommendations for governing principles for remedial measures that were developed for the audit committee by wcphd 
each of our and nnl s boards of directors has adopted these recommendations in their entirety and directed our management to develop a detailed plan and timetable for their implementation  and will monitor their implementation 
the summary of findings and of recommended remedial measures of the independent review is set forth in full in item a of our and nnl s annual reports on form k  or the annual reports 
as the independent review progressed  the audit committee directed new corporate management to examine in depth the concerns identified by wcphd regarding provisioning activity and to review certain provision releases 
that examination  and other errors identified by management  led to the restatement of our financial statements for the years ended december  and and the quarters ended march  and  june  and and september  and  or the second restatement  and our revision of previously announced unaudited results for the year ended december  the need for the second restatement resulted in delays in filing the annual reports  our and nnl s annual reports on form k for the year ended december   or the annual reports  and our and nnl s quarterly reports on form q for the first  second and third quarters of  or the quarterly reports  and is expected to result in a delay in filing our and nnl s quarterly reports on form q for the first quarter of  or the first quarter reports  beyond the sec s required filing dates 
we refer to the annual reports  the annual reports and the quarterly reports together as the reports 
over the course of the second restatement process  management identified certain accounting practices that it determined should be adjusted as part of the second restatement 
in particular  management identified certain errors related to revenue recognition and undertook a process of revenue reviews 
as described in more detail in the controls and procedures section of this report  in light of the resulting adjustments to revenues previously reported in relevant periods  the audit committee is reviewing the facts and circumstances leading to the restatement of these revenues for specific transactions identified in the second restatement 
this review has a particular emphasis on the underlying conduct that led to the initial recognition of these revenues 
the audit committee is seeking a full understanding of the historic events that required the revenues for these specific transactions to be restated and will consider any appropriate additional remedial measures  including those involving internal controls and processes 
the audit committee has engaged wcphd to advise it in connection with this review 
see risk factors forward looking statements 

table of contents over the course of the second restatement process  we and our independent auditors identified a number of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting all but one of which continued to exist as of december  
see the controls and procedures section of this report 
further  in connection with the independent review  we terminated for cause our former president and chief executive officer  former chief financial officer and former controller in april and seven additional senior finance employees with significant responsibilities for our financial reporting as a whole or for their respective business units and geographic areas in august we are subject to significant pending civil litigation and ongoing regulatory and criminal investigations in the us and canada  which could require us to pay substantial judgments  settlements  fines or other penalties 
we have made a number of recent appointments that are intended to enhance and complement our senior executive team 
these appointments included the new roles of chief operating officer  chief marketing officer  chief strategy officer  chief ethics and compliance officer and chief research officer and a new chief technology officer to lead the strategic vision for our product and technology portfolio 
our strategic plan and outlook on august   we announced a new strategic plan intended to enable us to build on our market leadership in developing the converged networks of the future and improve business efficiency and operating cost performance in an increasingly competitive market 
we provided further details concerning the strategic plan on september  and december  it is our intention to be optimally positioned to maximize strategic opportunities as they arise and leverage our acknowledged strengths in high reliability networks and strong customer loyalty 
we are driving our business forward on a platform of integrity with a focus on cash  costs and revenues as strategic goals 
we remain committed to our business strategy of technology and solutions evolution in helping our customers transform their networks and implement new applications and services to drive improved productivity  reduced costs and revenue growth 
the principal components of the strategic plan are a renewed commitment to best corporate practices and ethical conduct  including the establishment of the office of a chief ethics and compliance officer  a streamlined organizational structure to reflect alignment with carrier converged networks  an increased focus on the enterprise market and customers  optimized r d programs for highly secure  available and reliable converged networks  the establishment of a chief strategy officer to drive partnerships  new markets and acquisitions  the establishment of a chief marketing officer to drive overall marketing strategy  the strategic review of embedded services to assess opportunities in the professional services business  and a distinct focus on government and defense customers 
our strategic plan also includes a work plan involving focused workforce reductions  including a voluntary retirement program  of approximately  employees  real estate optimization and other cost containment actions such as reductions in information services costs  outsourced services and other discretionary spending 
our workforce actions are focused to disproportionately protect customer and sales facing roles as well as continue our focus on new innovative solutions 
we anticipate cost savings of approximately in related to this work plan  partially offset by planned investments in certain strategic areas such as the finance organization 
for further information related to our work plan  see results of operations continuing operations consolidated operating expenses special charges 
in  we are focusing on regions and networking solutions that we believe will be areas of potential growth and importance to our customers 
on a regional basis  we see potential significant growth opportunities in emerging markets such as china and india 
evidence of our focus on these emerging market opportunities includes our contract with bharat sanchar nigram limited  or bsnl  to establish a wireless network in india  our investment in sasken communication technologies ltd 
of india to develop new software and deploy our networking equipment and our planned joint venture with china putian corporation 
globally  we believe security and reliability for service provider networks are increasingly important to governments  defense interests and enterprises around the world 
in  we expect our management ebt to increase as compared to primarily due to expected higher revenues  the impact of cost savings generated by our work plan  and lower costs resulting from the substantial completion of our restatement activities 
we expect that the 
table of contents increase will be partially offset by increased investment costs in certain parts of the business and accruals for expected employee bonuses for which were not incurred in the expected increase in management ebt is also expected to be partially offset by increased special charges in compared to associated with our work plan and an expected absence of gain on sale of businesses and assets and income tax recoveries that were included in our results 
for the first quarter of  we expect modest growth in revenues compared to the first quarter of  gross margins are expected to be in the range of to percent of revenue  operating expenses to increase slightly compared to the first quarter of and an ending cash balance of approximately  how we measure performance our ceo has been identified as the chief operating decision maker in assessing the performance of the segments and the allocation of resources to the segments 
in  each reportable segment was managed separately with each segment manager reporting directly or indirectly to the ceo 
the ceo relies on the information derived directly from our management reporting system 
commencing in the second quarter of  in conjunction with the appointment of william a 
owens as our president and chief executive officer  the primary financial measure used by the ceo in assessing performance and allocating resources to the segments was management ebt 
this primary financial measure replaced contribution margin  the previously disclosed primary financial measure used for earlier periods 
see segment information general description in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
each reportable segment is also allocated resources and assets based on whether projected customer demand would support additional investment 
we make adjustments to resources and assets within a reportable segment in response to market conditions or where opportunities for improved efficiencies present themselves 
working capital for each segment is primarily managed by our regional finance organization which manages accounts receivable performance and by our global operations organization which manages inventory and accounts payable 
our other significant assets including cash and cash equivalents  deferred income taxes  goodwill and a significant portion of plant and equipment that relate to real estate and information systems infrastructure are managed at a corporate level and are not allocated to or managed by our segments 
our financial targets focus on cash  costs and revenue 
we expect to achieve targeted improvements in cash flow from operations by driving improved earnings performance and working capital management 
we measure working capital performance through the use of working capital metrics see liquidity and capital resources cash flows 
in particular  we are focused on improvements in accounts receivable performance and levels of inventory 
we have also set targets for cost reductions that include reducing our operating expenditures  which is our combined sg a and r d spending  as a percentage of revenue 
we are also focused on maximizing cost effectiveness as we continue to experience pricing pressures for many of our products 
we expect operating expenses as a percent of revenue to trend towards the low s by the end of primarily driven by benefits from our previously announced restructuring work plan and reductions in restatement  accounting and reporting costs 
we have implemented a variety of programs to drive lower costs including our work plan which targets a reduction of approximately  employees and cost savings of approximately on an annual basis 
our model of outsourced manufacturing  including our agreement with flextronics  is important to maximizing our long term cost effectiveness 
as a global supplier in the communications equipment market  one of the keys to our long term success is revenue growth 
in addition to efficiently providing global sales and support and product development  it is important that we maintain or gain market share for us to be viewed by our customers as a long term  innovative networking solutions supplier 
we are focusing on government  security and services to drive revenue growth as evidenced by our recent announcement of our planned acquisition of pec solutions  inc  or pec 
in addition to the above financial measures  we also monitor performance in the following areas status with our key customers on a global basis  the achievement of expected milestones of our key r d projects  and the achievement of our key strategic initiatives 
in an effort to ensure we are creating value for our customers and maintaining strong relationships with those customers  we monitor our project implementation  customer service levels and the status of key contracts 
we also conduct regular customer satisfaction and loyalty surveys to monitor customer relationships 
with respect to our r d projects  we measure content  quality and timeliness versus project plans 
our key strategic initiatives include our finance transformation project which will include  among other things  implementing a new information technology program sap to provide an integrated global financial system  our supply chain evolution strategy with flextronics  planned new joint ventures in asia  and improvements in the effectiveness of our strategic alliances

nortel audit committee independent review  restatements  related matters comprehensive review and first restatement in may  we commenced certain balance sheet reviews at the direction of certain members of former management that led to the comprehensive review  which resulted in the first restatement 
see the controls and procedures section of this report 
in connection with the comprehensive review  deloitte touche llp  or deloitte  our independent auditors  informed the audit committee on july  of a reportable condition that did not constitute a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting throughout this report with respect to dates and periods ended before december   reportable condition and material weakness have the meanings as formerly set forth under standards established by the american institute of certified public accountants  or aicpa  which are applicable for  with respect to dates and periods ending on or after december   material weakness has the meaning set forth under public company accounting oversight board auditing standard no 
throughout this report 
later  on november   as part of the communications by deloitte to the audit committee with respect to deloitte s interim audit procedures for the year ended december   deloitte informed the audit committee that it had identified certain reportable conditions  each of which constituted a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting 
these material weaknesses identified in the first restatement were also later identified in connection with the second restatement together with certain additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  as described in greater detail in the controls and procedures section of this report 
independent review in late october  the audit committee initiated  and engaged wcphd to advise it in connection with  the independent review in order to gain a full understanding of the events that caused significant excess liabilities to be maintained on the balance sheet that needed to be restated  and to recommend that our board of directors adopt  and direct management to implement  necessary remedial measures to address personnel  controls  compliance and discipline 
the independent review focused initially on events relating to the establishment and release of contractual liability and other related provisions also called accruals  reserves  or accrued liabilities in the second half of and the first half of  including the involvement of senior corporate leadership 
as the independent review evolved  its focus broadened to include specific provisioning activities in each of the business units and geographic regions 
in light of concerns raised in the initial phase of the independent review  the audit committee expanded the review to include provisioning activities in the third and fourth quarters of as discussed more fully in the controls and procedures section of this report  the independent review concluded that former corporate management now terminated for cause and former finance management now terminated for cause in the company s finance organization 
table of contents endorsed  and employees carried out  accounting practices relating to the recording and release of provisions that were not in compliance with us gaap in at least four quarters  including the third and fourth quarters of and the first and second quarters of in three of those four quarters when nortel was at  or close to  break even these practices were undertaken to meet internally imposed pro forma earnings before taxes targets 
while the dollar value of most of the individual provisions was relatively small  the aggregate value of the provisions made the difference between a profit and a reported loss  on a pro forma basis  in the fourth quarter of and the difference between a loss and a reported profit  on a pro forma basis  in the first and second quarters of second restatement as the independent review progressed  the audit committee directed new corporate management to examine in depth the concerns identified by wcphd regarding provisioning activity and to review provision releases  down to a low threshold 
that examination  and other errors identified by management  led to the second restatement 
on january   we filed our annual report on form k in which we restated our results for the years ended december  and for more information regarding the second restatement  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual reports  item a of the annual reports and note to the consolidated financial statements that accompany the annual reports 
material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as described above and in the controls and procedures section of this report  two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting were identified at the time of the first restatement 
over the course of the second restatement process  we and deloitte identified a number of additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  as further described in the controls and procedures section of this report 
on january   deloitte confirmed to the audit committee the material weaknesses listed below lack of compliance with written nortel procedures for monitoring and adjusting balances related to certain accruals and provisions  including restructuring charges and contract and customer accruals  lack of compliance with nortel procedures for appropriately applying applicable gaap to the initial recording of certain liabilities including those described in sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  or sfas no 
 and to foreign currency translation as described in sfas no 
 foreign currency translation  or sfas no 
 lack of sufficient personnel with appropriate knowledge  experience and training in us gaap and lack of sufficient analysis and documentation of the application of us gaap to transactions  including but not limited to revenue transactions  lack of a clear organization and accountability structure within the accounting function  including insufficient review and supervision  combined with financial reporting systems that are not integrated and which require extensive manual interventions  lack of sufficient awareness of  and timely and appropriate remediation of  internal control issues by nortel personnel  and an inappropriate tone at the top  which contributed to the lack of a strong control environment  as reported in the independent review summary included in the annual reports  there was a management tone at the top that conveyed the strong leadership message that earnings targets could be met through application of accounting practices that finance managers knew or ought to have known were not in compliance with us gaap and that questioning these practices was not acceptable 
the first five of these six material weaknesses continued to exist at december  we continue to identify  develop and implement remedial measures to address these material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  as described in the controls and procedures section of this report 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  or sox  management has assessed our internal control over financial reporting as at december   using the criteria issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission  or coso  in internal control integrated framework 
based on that assessment  management determined that the first five of the six material weaknesses listed above continued to exist as at december  because of these material weaknesses  management believes that  as at december   we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting based on the coso criteria 
our independent auditors have issued an attestation report with respect to that assessment and conclusion 
management also determined  based on that assessment  that the sixth material weakness  relating to an inappropriate tone at the top  was eliminated as at december  as a result of certain modifications to our internal control over financial reporting  remedial measures and other actions

under the terms of the agreement and offer  flextronics will also acquire our global repair services  as well as certain design assets in ottawa  canada and monkstown related to hardware and embedded software design  and related product verification for certain established optical products 
we have entered into a four year supply agreement with flextronics for manufacturing services whereby flextronics will manage approximately  of our annual cost of revenues and a three year supply agreement for design services 
the transfer of the optical design operations and related assets in ottawa and monkstown closed in the fourth quarter of in the first quarter of  we completed the portion of the transaction related to the manufacturing activities in montreal 
we previously reported that the portion of the transaction related to the manufacturing activities in calgary is expected to close in the second quarter of and that the balance of the transaction is expected to close on separate dates occurring during the first half of we and flextronics are currently discussing the timing of the closing of the balance of the transaction in order to optimize the business transition between the companies 
as a result of these discussions  it is now expected that the balance of the transaction  relating to the manufacturing operations in chateaudun  calgary and monkstown  will close by the end of the first quarter of as a result  we and flextronics intend to enter into an amendment agreement to extend the term of the original agreement and offer to reflect this updated schedule 
these transactions are subject to customary conditions and regulatory approvals

table of contents bharat sanchar nigram limited contract in august  we entered into a contract with bsnl to establish a wireless network in india which we expect to generate approximately in revenues to be recognized substantially in we believe that this contract has strategic importance and we expect that it will position us to capitalize on india s potentially significant future growth for our long term benefit 
our commitments to date for orders received as of december  under this contract have resulted in an estimated project loss of approximately  which has been recorded as a charge to cost of revenues and accrued within contractual liabilities in we expect to record an additional loss of approximately in the first half of as a result of additional orders received in that period 
the losses on this contract are primarily driven by the pricing pressures as a result of the competitive nature of india s telecom market and also our start up costs to become a significant gsm vendor in this market 
we believe that the revenue volumes driven by this contract will create cost reduction benefits for our overall gsm business 
in addition to the orders under the existing contract  bsnl may increase the amounts purchased under the contract up to an additional of the existing contract level to allow for business expansion 
we expect that there is the potential for further product losses  which will be determined by the product mix and magnitude of additional orders

table of contents results of operations continuing operations consolidated revenues the following chart summarizes our quarterly revenues for and bar chart vs 
in  there was increased spending in the industry compared to by both service provider and enterprise customers as certain service provider customers began to expand and upgrade their existing networks  including next generation wireless technologies and voip solutions 
this increase in industry spending was strongest in the build out of new technologies in both established and emerging markets and with the build out of traditional technologies in emerging markets 
although there was increased spending in the industry by both service provider and enterprise customers we experienced a decline in revenue in compared to there was decreased spending on our overall traditional technologies as customers continued to transition to next generation technologies 
this decreased spending on traditional technologies outpaced the increased spending on new technologies with many of our customers realigning capital spending with their current levels of earnings in order to maximize their return on invested capital 
also  excess network capacity and competition continued to exist in the industry  which led to continued pricing pressures on the sale of certain of our products 
our consolidated revenues decreased in compared to primarily due to declines across all segments with the exception of wireless networks which increased 
wireless networks revenues increased in compared to primarily due to increased spending by our wireless service provider customers on our gsm and umts technologies as a result of new contracts with certain customers as they continue to transition to next generation technologies and other customers expanding their existing networks to meet increased subscriber demand or enhancing their networks to support more sophisticated communication services 
enterprise networks declined in compared to primarily due to a substantial decline in revenues of our traditional circuit switching products and interactive voice response products 
this substantial decline was primarily due to the recognition of revenues in deferred from prior periods that did not occur to the same extent in as described below under enterprise networks revenues 
we also experienced declines in revenues associated with our legacy routing portfolio and associated declines in new service contracts and service contract renewals 
in addition  we experienced a decline in revenue from certain of our data networking products primarily due to pricing pressures driven by increased competition 
wireline networks revenues declined in compared to primarily due to a substantial decline in our traditional circuit switching revenues  which continued to decline at a faster rate than the growth in our next generation wireline technologies 
optical networks revenues declined in compared to primarily due to a substantial decline in the optical long haul portion of this segment due to reduced customer spending and ongoing pricing pressures 
the revenues of the metro optical portion of this segment increased significantly and surpassed long haul revenues in terms of volume in in addition  a substantial portion of the decline was due in part to a cumulative correction of revenues previously recognized primarily in and relating to the delivery of future contractual post contract support  or pcs  and other services  as described below under optical networks revenues 

table of contents although we experienced a decline in revenue in compared to  based on current customer orders in emerging markets  particularly in asia and cala and increased deployments of voip and next generation wireless technologies  including umts  we believe that we are well positioned to grow our revenues in for example  throughout and into  we announced several new contracts across all of our reportable segments  but primarily in our wireless networks segment  as certain service provider customers began to expand and upgrade their existing networks and new network build outs were started in emerging markets and as a result of new technologies 
for  we expect overall revenue growth over primarily due to continued growth in our voice over packet technologies and our third generation wireless technologies  expansion and enhancement of existing networks by our customers due to subscriber growth and competitive pressures  build out of the bsnl contract in the asia pacific region

revenue growth generated from spending by our customers in the above areas of our business is expected to be partially offset by revenue declines from customers limiting their investment in mature technologies as they focus on maximizing return on invested capital  pricing pressures on sales of certain of our products as a result of increased competition  particularly from low cost suppliers  consolidation of service providers which may reduce overall spending on telecom equipment  and the impact of our financial restatement activities and the internal restructuring and realignment programs that were initiated in august for additional information  see business overview our business environment

enterprise networks revenues decreased in compared to due to a significant decrease in the circuit and packet voice portion of this segment and a slight decrease in the data networking and security portion of this segment 
revenues from the circuit and packet voice portion of this segment decreased significantly primarily due to a substantial decrease in revenues associated with our traditional circuit switching and interactive voice response products primarily in the us this substantial decrease in revenues was primarily a result of the release of certain software  including the general availability of succession in the fourth quarter of the general availability of this software triggered the recognition of associated revenues deferred from prior periods  resulting in a net increase in revenues of in in the fourth quarter of that did not occur to the same extent in in addition  revenues from certain products associated with various software upgrade marketing programs initiated in did not meet the criteria for revenue recognition in and were deferred to future periods 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenues across all regions primarily associated with our converged internet protocol  or ip  telephony solutions as customers continued to migrate towards converged packet voice solutions from our traditional circuit switching products 
revenues associated with the data networking and security portion of this segment decreased slightly primarily due to a decline in revenues associated with our legacy routing portfolio and associated declines in new service contracts and service contract renewals 
we also experienced a decline in revenue from certain of our data networking products primarily due to pricing pressures driven by increased competition

table of contents enterprise networks revenues declined sequentially in the first and second quarters of and increased sequentially in the third and fourth quarters of the sequential declines in the first half of were primarily due to customers having sufficient network capacity  continued capital spending restrictions by our customers and delays associated with the establishment of new channel relationships to address demand from small and medium sized enterprise customers 
the sequential increases in revenues in the second half of were primarily due to sequential increases in revenues associated with our ip telephony solutions as our customers continued to migrate toward packet voice solutions as well as revenue recognized due to the release of certain software including succession in the fourth quarter of further  we experienced sequential revenue increases in the third and fourth quarters of from our interactive voice response and security products as a result of certain new product releases in the second half of in  we expect that data  voice and multimedia communications will continue to converge  and enterprises will look for ways to maximize the effectiveness of their existing networks while reducing ongoing capital expenditures and operating costs 
also  we anticipate that demand will continue to decline for our traditional circuit switching solutions  however  it is difficult to determine the extent to which future declines in demand will occur as a result of the migration to voice over packet technologies

wireline networks revenues decreased in compared to primarily due to a substantial decline in our traditional circuit switching product revenues 
revenues from the circuit and packet voice portion of this segment decreased significantly primarily due to a substantial decline in our traditional circuit switching product revenues 
the substantial decline in our traditional circuit switching product revenues was primarily due to continued reductions in capital expenditures by our u 
s  canada and emea service provider customers and a reduction in spending on our mature products in all regions 
the substantial decline in traditional circuit switching product revenues was partially offset by the substantial increase in revenues related to our packet voice solutions in all regions but primarily in the u 
s and cala as customers transitioned to these next generation products from our traditional circuit switching products 
revenues from the data networking and security portion of this segment decreased significantly in compared to primarily due to substantial declines in the us and canada  and a significant decline in emea 
in these regions  we experienced a decline in demand for our mature products primarily due to the ongoing shift towards ip based technology 
vs 
wireline networks revenues decreased in compared to primarily due to a substantial reduction in capital spending by our service provider customers as a result of the continued industry adjustment 

table of contents revenues from the circuit and packet voice portion of this segment decreased substantially in compared to primarily due to a substantial decrease in the u 
s in our traditional circuit switching product revenues and also uncertainty related to the impact of the federal communications commission  or fcc  decision regarding the regulation of the availability of unbundled network elements  or unes  released on august  and subsequent judicial review and fcc reconsideration of the decision 
the substantial decline in our circuit switching revenues was primarily due to the continuing impact of capital spending restrictions experienced by our service provider customers during and tightened capital markets mainly during the first half of across all regions 
in addition  the decline was due in part to the completion of a major contract in cala in the first quarter of revenues from our packet voice solutions increased substantially across all regions except emea in compared to primarily due to new service provider contracts throughout revenues from the data networking and security portion of this segment decreased significantly in compared to primarily due to substantial declines in the us and asia pacific and a significant decline in cala 
in these regions  we experienced a decline in demand for our mature products primarily due to the ongoing shift towards ip based technology 
in  our service provider customers continue to increase the deployment of packet based technologies in their communications networks as they look for ways to optimize their existing networks and offer new revenue generating services while limiting capital expenditures and operating costs 
however  the timing of when service provider customers will deploy packet based technologies on a wider scale is still unclear 
the demand for our traditional circuit switching products has continued to decline as certain service providers continued to reduce their capital expenditures on these legacy technologies

revenues in the long haul portion of this segment declined substantially in the us  asia pacific and emea  declined significantly in canada and declined slightly in cala 
this was due in part to reduced spending by customers as they continued to focus on maximizing return on invested capital by increasing the capacity utilization rates and efficiency of existing networks 
significant excess inventories and capacity continued to exist in this portion of the segment which also resulted in ongoing pricing pressures across all regions 
in addition  a substantial portion of the decline was a result of a cumulative correction made in the third quarter of for revenues previously recognized primarily in and these previously recognized revenues related to past sales of equipment to certain customers in the asia pacific region which we subsequently determined should have been deferred and recognized with the delivery of future contractual pcs and other services over the term of the pcs 
a corresponding correction was made in the third quarter of to the associated costs of revenues which should also have been deferred and recognized with the delivery of future contractual pcs and other services

in the fourth quarter of  we sold certain optical components assets to bookham 
as a result  our results in in the long haul portion of this segment do not reflect revenues generated from these assets 
in  revenues generated from the optical components assets sold to bookham were approximately of the total optical networks revenues of  revenues in the metro optical portion of this segment were relatively flat in compared to this was primarily due to a substantial decrease in emea partially offset by an increase in revenues in the us and a substantial increase in asia pacific 
the substantial decrease in emea was primarily the result of the continued industry adjustment  tightened capital markets mainly during the first half of and customer spending restrictions 
the increase in revenues in the us and the substantial increase in asia pacific were primarily due to new customer contracts during the first half of for expansions of existing networks to meet increased customer demand 
in  our major customers in the optical long haul portion of optical networks remain focused on maximizing return on their invested capital by increasing the capacity utilization rates and efficiency of existing networks 
we expect that any additional capital spending by those customers in the near term will be increasingly directed to opportunities that enhance customer performance  revenue generation and cost reduction 
we anticipate an increase in demand for dense wavelength division multiplexing solutions within the metro optical portion of this segment 
this expected increase is primarily due to new network deployments by certain customers and other customers expanding their networks  driven by emerging applications such as cable video on demand  all of which have resulted in increased demand for low cost  high capacity connectivity between network sites 
as a result  we expect that the metro optical portion of this segment will continue to represent a larger percentage of overall optical networks revenues 
while we have seen encouraging indicators in certain parts of the optical market  we can provide no assurance that the growth areas that have begun to emerge will continue in the future

working capital metrics the reduction in cash flows associated with our working capital performance in was due to changes in accounts receivable of and inventories of  partially offset by an increase due to changes in accounts payable of  as further described below 

table of contents accounts receivable net days sales outstanding in accounts receivables  or dso  measures the average number of days our accounts receivables are outstanding 
dso is a metric that approximates the measure of the average number of days from when we recognize revenue until we collect cash from our customers 
the following table shows our quarterly dso a bar chart a dso for each quarter is calculated by dividing the quarter end accounts receivable net balance by revenues for the quarter  in each case as determined in accordance with gaap  and multiplying by days 
dso increased as of december  compared to december  primarily due to reduced accounts receivable securitization  increase of deferred revenues primarily in the fourth quarter of  one time recognition of of deferred revenue in our enterprise networks segment in the fourth quarter of  and reduced focus on collection activities  particularly in the first half of  due to our restatement activities 
also contributing to the average increase of dso was increased wireless networks revenues from a large number of contracts involving progress billing  due to significant portions of collections occurring upon project completion 
in  we will continue to focus on improving our collections process 
offsetting this expected improvement is an expected increase in the number of contracts involving progress billing 
we expect to experience fluctuations in collections performance in individual quarters 

table of contents inventories net net inventory days  or nid  is a metric that approximates the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product 
the following table shows our quarterly nid a bar chart a nid for each quarter is calculated by dividing the average of the current quarter and prior quarter inventories net by the cost of revenues for the quarter  in each case as determined in accordance with us gaap  and multiplying by days 
finished goods inventory includes certain direct and incremental costs associated with arrangements where title and risk of loss was transferred to the customer but revenue was deferred due to other revenue recognition criteria not being met 
as of december  and  these deferred costs totaled and  respectively 
nid increased as of december  compared to december  primarily due to the increased deferred costs associated with deferred revenues as described in note a of the table above  and an increase in inventory to meet new contract requirements  particularly in asia for wireless projects  including bsnl 
nid is normally highest in the third quarter as inventory is held to support sales in the fourth quarter  which is typically our strongest quarter of the year in terms of revenues 
however  in  nid in the third quarter was reduced due to the impact of the project loss related to bsnl 
in addition  while nid decreased overall between the third quarter of and the second quarter of  it increased through the third quarter and particularly in the fourth quarter of as a result of increases associated with deferred revenues across all of our segments 
in  we expect that nid will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will normally be highest in the third quarter as inventory is held to support sales in the fourth quarter  which is typically our strongest quarter of the year in terms of revenues 
inventory management continues to be an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive delivery performance to our customers against the risk of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer spending requirements 

table of contents days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable  or dpo  is a metric that approximates the average number of days from when we receive purchased goods and services until we pay our suppliers 
the following table shows the quarterly dpo a bar chart a dpo for each quarter is calculated by dividing the quarter end trade and other accounts payable by the cost of revenues for the quarter  in each case  as determined in accordance with gaap  and multiplying by days 
dpo increased to days as of december  from days as of december  as we placed additional focus on establishing competitive payment terms with our suppliers and improving the processing of payments to match payment terms 
dpo will normally be highest in the third quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter due to the impact of purchasing inventory in the third quarter to support sales in the fourth quarter  which is generally our strongest quarter of the year in terms of revenue 
however  the lower dpo in the third and the higher dpo in the fourth quarter of did not reflect this trend primarily due to the impact of the project loss related to the bsnl project and the deferred cost increases in the fourth quarter as described above 
while we will continue our focus on managing our dpo  we expect that dpo will continue to fluctuate on a quarter by quarter basis

we continue to regularly assess the levels of our customer financing provisions based on a loan by loan review to evaluate whether the terms of each loan reflect current market conditions 
we review the ability of our customers to meet their repayment obligations and determine our provisions accordingly 
commitments to extend future financing generally have conditions for funding  fixed expiration or termination dates and specific interest rates and purposes

however  if capital spending by service providers and other customers changes from what we currently expect  we may be required to adjust our current business model 
as a result  our revenues and cash flows may be materially lower than we expect and we may be required to further reduce our investments or take other measures in order to meet our cash requirements 
in the future  we may seek additional funds from liquidity generating transactions and other sources of external financing

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements bid  performance related and other bonds we have entered into bid  performance related and other bonds in connection with various contracts 
bid bonds generally have a term of less than twelve months  depending on the length of the bid period for the applicable contract 
performance related and other bonds generally have a term of twelve months and are typically renewed  as required  over the term of the applicable contract 
the various contracts to which these bonds apply generally have terms ranging from two to five years 
any potential payments which might become due under these bonds would be related to our non performance under the applicable contract 
historically  we have not had to make material payments and we do not anticipate that we will be required to make material payments under these types of bonds 
the following table provides information related to these types of bonds as of december  bid and performance related bonds a other bonds b total bid  performance related and other bonds a net of restricted cash and cash equivalents of as of december  and as of december  b net of restricted cash and cash equivalents of as of december  and as of december  the criteria under which bid  performance related and other bonds can be obtained changed due to the industry environment primarily in and during that timeframe  in addition to the payment of higher fees  we experienced significant cash collateral requirements in connection with obtaining new bid  performance related and other bonds 
given that the edc support facility is used to support bid and performance bonds with varying terms  including those with at least day terms  we will likely need to increase our use of cash collateral to support these obligations beginning on january  absent a further extension of the facility 
the edc support facility provides support for certain obligations under bid and performance related bonds and has reduced the requirement to provide cash collateral to support these obligations 
as of december   the edc support facility provided for up to in support  of which was uncommitted support for performance bonds of which was outstanding 
the remainder was uncommitted support  subject to certain limitations  for performance bonds  receivables sales and or securitizations of which was outstanding as of december  any bid or performance related bonds with terms that extend beyond december  are currently not eligible for the support provided by this facility 
in addition to the support facility with edc  our existing security agreements permit us to equally and ratably secure additional obligations under bid and performance related bonds with the assets pledged under the security agreements and to provide cash collateral as security for these types of bonds

 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  or fin  and in december  the fasb issued a revision of fin fin revised  or fin r 
fin r provides guidance with respect to the consolidation of variable interest entities  or vies 
vies are characterized as entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or there is not sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
reporting entities which have a variable interest in such an entity and are deemed to be the primary beneficiary must consolidate the variable interest entity 

table of contents certain of our lease financing transactions were structured through single transaction vies that did not have sufficient equity at risk as defined in fin r 
effective july   we prospectively began consolidating two vies for which we were considered the primary beneficiary following the guidance of fin  on the basis that we retained certain risks associated with guaranteeing recovery of the unamortized principal balance of the vies debt  which represented the majority of the risks associated with the respective vies activities 
the amount of the guarantees will be adjusted over time as the underlying debt matures 
during  the debt related to one of the vies was extinguished and as a result consolidation of this vie was no longer required 
as of december   our consolidated balance sheet included of long term debt and of plant and equipment net related to these vies 
these amounts represented both the collateral and maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with these vies 
as of december   we did not have any variable interests related to transfers of financial assets 
we have other financial interests and contractual arrangements which would meet the definition of a variable interest under fin r  including investments in other companies and joint ventures  customer financing arrangements  and guarantees and indemnification arrangements 
as of december   none of these interests or arrangements were considered significant variable interests and  therefore  did not meet the requirements for consolidation under fin r 
we have also conducted certain receivable sales transactions either directly with financial institutions or with multi seller conduits 
under some of these agreements  we have continued as servicing agent and or have provided limited recourse 
the fair value of these retained interests is based on the market value of servicing the receivables  historical payment patterns  expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates as applicable 
where we have acted as the servicing agent  we generally have not recorded an asset or liability related to servicing as the annual servicing fees were equivalent to those that would have been paid to a third party servicing agent 
also  we have not historically experienced significant credit losses with respect to receivables sold with limited recourse 
as of december   we were not required to  and did not  consolidate or provide any of the additional disclosures set out in fin r with respect to the variable interest entities involving receivable sales 
additionally  we have agreed to indemnify some of our counterparties in certain receivables securitization transactions 
the indemnifications provided to counterparties in these types of transactions may require us to compensate counterparties for costs incurred as a result of changes in laws and regulations including tax legislation or in the interpretations of such laws and regulations  or as a result of regulatory penalties that may be suffered by the counterparty as a consequence of the transaction 
certain receivables securitization transactions include indemnifications requiring the repurchase of the receivables if the particular transaction becomes invalid 
as of december   we had approximately of securitized receivables which were subject to repurchase under this provision  in which case  we would assume all rights to collect such receivables 
the indemnification provisions generally expire upon expiration of the securitization agreements  which extend through  or collection of the receivable amount by the counterparty 
we are generally unable to estimate the maximum potential liability for all of these types of indemnification guarantees as certain agreements do not specify a maximum amount and the amounts are dependent upon the outcome of future contingent events  the nature and likelihood of which cannot be determined at this time 
historically  we have not made any significant indemnification payments or receivable repurchases under these agreements and no significant liability has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the obligation associated with these guarantees 
other indemnifications or guarantees through our normal course of business  we have also entered into other indemnifications or guarantees that arise in various types of arrangements including third party debt agreements  business sale and business combination agreements  intellectual property indemnification obligations  lease agreements  indemnification of banks and agents under our credit and support facilities and security agreements  and other indemnification agreements 
in  we did not make any significant payments under any of these indemnifications or guarantees 
in certain cases  due to the nature of the agreement  we have not been able to estimate our maximum potential loss or the maximum potential loss has not been specified 
for additional information  see guarantees in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

table of contents application of critical accounting policies and estimates our accompanying consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting policies  generally accepted in the us  which require us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and require us to make significant accounting estimates 
the application of these estimates requires us to make subjective and objective judgments 
in general  any changes in estimates or assumptions relating to revenue recognition  provisions for doubtful accounts  provisions for inventory and other contingencies excluding legal contingencies are directly reflected in the results of our reportable operating segments 
changes in estimates or assumptions pertaining to our tax asset valuations  our pension and post retirement benefits and our legal contingencies are generally not reflected in our reportable operating segments  but are reflected on a consolidated basis 
we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition our material revenue streams are the result of a wide range of activities  from custom design and installation over a period of time to a single delivery of equipment to a customer 
our networking solutions also cover a broad range of technologies and are offered on a global basis 
as a result  our revenue recognition policies can differ depending on the level of customization within the solution and the contractual terms with the customer 
newer technologies within one of our reporting segments may also have different revenue recognition policies  depending on  among other factors  the specific performance and acceptance criteria within the applicable contract 
therefore  management must use judgment in determining how to apply the current accounting standards and interpretations  not only based on the networking solution  but also within networking solutions based on reviewing the level of customization and contractual terms with the customer 
as a result  our revenues may fluctuate from period to period based on the mix of solutions sold and the geographic region in which they are sold 
when a sale involves multiple deliverables where the deliverables are governed by more than one authoritative standard  we evaluate all deliverables to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting based on the following criteria whether the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s  and if the contract includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and is substantially in our control 
our determination of whether deliverables within a multiple element arrangement can be treated separately for revenue recognition purposes involves significant estimates and judgment  such as whether fair value can be established on undelivered obligations and or whether delivered elements have standalone value to the customer 
changes to our assessment of the accounting units in an arrangement and or our ability to establish fair values could significantly change the timing of revenue recognition 
if objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for all units of accounting in the contract  revenue is allocated to each unit of accounting or element based on relative fair values 
in situations where there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all undelivered elements  but not for delivered elements  the residual method is used to allocate the contract consideration 
under the residual method  the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements 
each unit of accounting is then accounted for under the applicable revenue recognition guidance 
if fair value does not exist for any undelivered element  revenue is not recognized until the earlier of i the undelivered element is delivered or ii fair value of the undelivered element exists  unless the undelivered element is a service  in which case revenue is recognized as the service is performed once the service is the only undelivered element 
our assessment of which revenue recognition guidance is appropriate to account for a deliverable also can involve significant judgment 
for instance  the determination of whether software is more than incidental to hardware can impact whether the hardware is accounted for under software revenue recognition or general revenue recognition guidance 
this assessment could impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition 

table of contents for accounting units related to customized network solutions and certain network build outs  revenues are recognized under aicpa statement of position using the percentage of completion method 
in using the percentage of completion method  revenues are generally recorded based on a measure of the percentage of costs incurred to date on a contract relative to the estimated total expected contract costs 
profit estimates on long term contracts are revised periodically based on changes in circumstances and any losses on contracts are recognized in the period that such losses become known 
generally  the terms of long term contracts provide for progress billing based on completion of certain phases of work 
contract revenues recognized  based on costs incurred towards the completion of the project  that are unbilled are accumulated in the contracts in progress account included in accounts receivable net 
billings in excess of revenues recognized to date on long term contracts are recorded as advance billings in excess of revenues recognized to date on contracts within other accrued liabilities 
significant judgment is often required when estimating total contract costs and progress to completion on these arrangements  as well as whether a loss is expected to be incurred on the contract 
management uses historical experience  project plans and an assessment of the risks and uncertainties inherent in the arrangement to establish these estimates 
uncertainties include implementation delays or performance issues that may or may not be within our control 
changes in these estimates could result in a material impact on revenues and net earnings loss 
revenue for hardware that does not require significant customization  and where any software is considered incidental  is recognized under sec staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition  or sab under sab  revenue is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for hardware  delivery is considered to have occurred upon shipment provided that risk of loss  and title in certain jurisdictions  have been transferred to the customer 
for arrangements where the criteria for revenue recognition have not been met because legal title or risk of loss on products did not transfer to the buyer until final payment had been received or where delivery had not occurred  revenue is deferred to a later period when title or risk of loss passes either on delivery or on receipt of payment from the customer 
for arrangements where the customer agrees to purchase products but we retain possession until the customer requests shipment  or bill and hold arrangements  revenue is not recognized until delivery to the customer has occurred and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we make certain sales through multiple distribution channels  primarily resellers and distributors 
these customers are generally given certain rights of return 
for products sold through these distribution channels  revenue is recognized from product sale at the time of shipment to the distribution channel when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
accruals for estimated sales returns and other allowances and deferrals are recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time of revenue recognition 
these provisions are based on contract terms and prior claims experience and involve significant estimates 
if these estimates are significantly different from actual results  our revenue could be impacted 
we provide extended payment terms on certain software contracts and may sell these receivables to third parties 
the fees on these contracts are considered fixed or determinable if the contracts are similar to others for which we have a standard business practice of providing extended payment terms and have a history of successfully collecting under the original payment terms without making concessions 
if fees are not considered fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement  revenue for delivered products is deferred until the fees become legally due and payable and therefore estimates and judgment in this area can impact the timing of revenue recognition 
the collectibility of trade and notes receivables is also critical in determining whether revenue should be recognized 
as part of the revenue recognition process  we determine whether trade or notes receivables are reasonably assured of collection and whether there has been deterioration in the credit quality of our customers that could result in our inability to collect the receivables 
we will defer revenue but recognize related costs if we are uncertain as to whether we will be able to collect the receivable 
as a result  our estimates and judgment regarding customer credit quality could significantly impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
for further information on our revenue recognition policies relating to our material revenue streams  you should also refer to note d of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
provisions for doubtful accounts in establishing the appropriate provisions for trade  notes and long term receivables due from customers  we make assumptions with respect to their future collectibility 
our assumptions are based on an individual assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends  including the aging of receivable balances 
generally  these individual credit assessments occur prior to the inception of the credit exposure and at regular reviews during the life of the exposure and consider 
table of contents a customer s ability to meet and sustain its financial commitments  a customer s current and projected financial condition  the positive or negative effects of the current and projected industry outlook  and the economy in general 
once we consider all of these individual factors  we make a determination as to the probability of default 
an appropriate provision is then made  which takes into consideration the severity of the likely loss on the outstanding receivable balance based on our experience in collecting these amounts 
in addition to these individual assessments  in general  outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts for which recovery is not expected that are greater than days are fully provisioned for and amounts greater than days are provisioned for 
as part of our review of the provision for doubtful accounts in  our recent historical experience as to lower bad debt write offs was factored into the analysis so as to require a lesser percentage of provisions for aged balances and  accordingly  we reduced our provision for doubtful accounts by approximately this was recorded as a reduction to sg a expense in the third quarter of and was in addition to any adjustments related to our ongoing provisioning process 
in subsequent periods  we may be required to make adjustments once further information becomes available or actual events occur 
as a result  we may incur significant adjustments to our provisions for trade  notes and long term receivables 
we recorded net trade and customer financing receivable recoveries related to continuing operations of in in and  we recorded receivable recoveries related to continuing operations of and receivable provisions related to continuing operations of  respectively 
the net receivable recoveries of in and in primarily related to trade and customer financing receivable recoveries as a result of favorable settlements related to our sale or restructuring of various receivables as well as net recoveries on other trade and customer financing receivables due to subsequent collections for amounts exceeding our original estimates of net recovery 
these recoveries were partially offset by receivable provisions recorded during that related to our normal business activity 
the receivable provisions recorded in were primarily related to the financial difficulties of several of our service provider and enterprise customers as a result of the significant industry adjustment 
the following table summarizes our accounts receivable and long term receivable balances and related reserves of our continuing operations as of december  gross accounts receivable provision for doubtful accounts accounts receivable net accounts receivable provision as a percentage of gross accounts receivables gross long term receivables provision for doubtful accounts net long term receivables long term receivable provision as a percentage of gross long term receivables provisions for inventory management must make estimates about the future customer demand for our products when establishing the appropriate provisions for inventory 
when making these estimates  we consider general economic conditions and growth prospects within our customers ultimate marketplace  and the market acceptance of our current and pending products 
these judgments must be made in the context of our customers shifting technology needs and changes in the geographic mix of our customers 
with respect to our provisioning policy  in general  we fully reserve for surplus inventory in excess of our day demand forecast or that we deem to be obsolete 
generally  our inventory provisions have an inverse relationship with the projected demand for our products 
for example  our provisions usually increase as projected demand decreases due to adverse changes in the conditions mentioned above 
we have experienced significant changes in required provisions in recent periods due to changes in strategic direction  such as discontinuances of product lines  as well as declining market conditions 
a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of any of these conditions could result in inventory losses in excess of the provisions determined to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date 

table of contents the following table summarizes our inventory balances and other related reserves of our continuing operations as of december  gross inventory inventory provisions inventories net b inventory provisions as a percentage of gross inventory other reserves for claims related to our contract manufacturers and suppliers a a this amount was included in other accrued liabilities and related to cancellation charges  contracted for inventory in excess of future demand and the settlement of certain other claims 
b includes long term portion of inventory related to the deferred costs which is included in other assets 
as of december   our inventory provisions as a percentage of gross inventory was 
we recorded inventory provisions related to continuing operations of  as of december  and  as of december  inventory provisions increased due to of additional inventory provisions and as a result of foreign exchange fluctuations  reclassifications and other adjustments offset by of scrapped inventory and of reductions due to sale of inventory 
in the future  we may be required to make significant adjustments to these provisions for the sale and or disposition of inventory that was provided for in prior periods 
customers continued to be cautious with their capital expenditures in as a result  we will continue to closely monitor our inventory provisions to ensure that they appropriately reflect the current market conditions 
however  the inventory provisions we have recorded in the past may not be reflective of those in future quarters 
provisions for product warranties provisions are recorded for estimated costs related to warranties given to customers on our products to cover defects 
these provisions are calculated based on historical return rates as well as on estimates which take into consideration the historical material replacement costs and the associated labor costs to correct the product defect 
known product defects are specifically provided for as we become aware of such defects 
revisions are made when actual experience differs materially from historical experience 
these provisions for product warranties are part of the cost of revenues and are accrued when the products are sold 
they represent the best possible estimate  at the time the sale is made  of the expenses to be incurred under the warranty granted 
warranty terms generally range from one to six years from the date of sale depending upon the product 
we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of revenues based on associated material costs and technical support labor costs 
material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment 
technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the rate of customer warranty claims and projected claims within the warranty period 

table of contents the following table summarizes the accrual for product warranties that was recorded as part of other accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of december balance at the beginning of the year payments warranties issued revisions balance at the end of the year the decline in warranties issued in compared to is primarily due to improvements in the quality of our products 
warranty provisions we have recorded in the past may not be reflective of those in future periods 
if we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience  or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than the expectations on which the accrual has been based  our gross margin could be adversely affected 
we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers 
our estimated warranty obligation is based upon warranty terms  ongoing product failure rates  historical material replacement costs and the associated labor to correct the product defect 
if actual product failure rates  material replacement costs  service or labor costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty provision would be required 
income taxes tax asset valuation our net deferred tax assets balance  excluding discontinued operations  was  at december  and  at december  the increase was primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange effects related primarily to the canadian dollar and british pound  a release of valuation allowance in certain jurisdictions  and a reclassification of a portion of our deferred income tax liabilities to current income taxes payable 
we currently have deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences  all of which are available to reduce future taxes payable in our significant tax jurisdictions 
generally  our loss carryforward periods range from seven years to an indefinite period 
as a result  we do not expect that a significant portion of these carryforwards will expire in the near future 
we assess the realization of these deferred tax assets quarterly to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required 
based on available evidence  both positive and negative  we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized 
the main factors that we consider include cumulative losses in recent years  history of loss carryforwards and other tax assets expiring  the carryforward period associated with the deferred tax assets  the nature of the income that can be used to realize the deferred tax assets  our net earnings loss  and future earnings potential determined through the use of internal forecasts 
in evaluating the positive and negative evidence  the weight given to each type of evidence must be proportionate to the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
if it is our belief that it is more likely than not that some portion of these assets will not be realized  an income tax valuation allowance is recorded 
primarily as a result of losses realized in and  we concluded that it was more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets would not be realized 
accordingly  an income tax valuation allowance has been recorded against these deferred income tax assets 
however  due to the fact that the majority of the carryforwards do not expire in the near future  our extended history of earnings in our material tax jurisdictions exclusive of and  and our future expectations of earnings  we concluded that it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred income tax asset recorded as of december  will be realized 

table of contents in  our gross income tax valuation allowances increased to  as of december  compared to  as of december  the increase was primarily due to additional valuation allowances recorded against current period losses in certain jurisdictions and the impacts of foreign exchange 
we assessed positive evidence including forecasts of future taxable income to support realization of the net deferred tax assets  and negative evidence including our cumulative loss position  and concluded that the valuation allowances as of december  were appropriate 
we continue to review all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdictional basis and our valuation allowance may need to be adjusted in the future as a result of this ongoing review 
given the magnitude of our valuation allowance  future adjustments to this allowance based on actual results could result in a significant adjustment to our net earnings 
tax contingencies we are subject to ongoing examinations by certain taxation authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we regularly assess the status of these examinations and the potential for adverse outcomes to determine the adequacy of the provision for income and other taxes 
we believe that we have adequately provided for tax adjustments that we believe are probable as a result of any ongoing or future examination 
specifically  the tax authorities in brazil have recently completed an examination of a prior taxation year and have issued an assessment in the amount of we are currently in the process of appealing this assessment and believe that we have adequately provided for tax adjustments that are probable as a result of the outcome of the ongoing appeals process 
in addition  tax authorities in france have recently begun an examination of a prior taxation year and have issued a preliminary notice of proposed assessment for a material amount 
no amount has been provided for this assessment since we believe that this proposed assessment is without merit and any potential tax adjustments that could result from this ongoing examination cannot be quantified at this time 
we had previously entered into advance pricing arrangements  or apas  with the taxation authorities of the us and canada in connection with our intercompany transfer pricing and cost sharing arrangements between canada and the us these arrangements expired in and in  we filed apa requests with the taxation authorities of the us canada and the united kingdom  or the u 
k  that are expected to apply to the taxation years beginning in the apa requests are currently under consideration but the tax authorities have not begun to negotiate the terms of the arrangement 
we have applied the transfer pricing methodology proposed in the apa requests since as part of the apa applications  we have requested that the methodology adopted in be applied retroactively to the taxation year 
if the retroactive application is accepted by the taxation authorities  it would result in an increase in taxable income in certain jurisdictions offset by an equal decrease in taxable income in the other jurisdictions 
we have provided for any taxes and interest that would be due as a result of retroactive application of the apas 
although the outcome of the apa applications are uncertain  we do not believe it is probable that the ultimate resolution of these negotiations will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
despite our current belief  if this matter is resolved unfavorably  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
goodwill valuation commencing january   we test goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis as of october of each year and at any other time if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
circumstances that could trigger an impairment test between annual tests include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in the business climate or legal factors  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  the likelihood that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of  a change in reportable segments  results of testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  and or recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit 

table of contents the impairment test for goodwill is a two step process 
step one consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit 
measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit is based on one or more fair value measures 
these measures involve significant management judgment and as a result are subject to change 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  step two requires the fair value of the reporting unit to be allocated to the underlying assets and liabilities of that reporting unit  resulting in an implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded in net earnings loss 
the fair value of each reporting unit is determined by allocating our total fair value among our reporting units using an average of three valuation models  a discounted cash flow model  or the dcf model  a model based on estimated revenue multiples  or the revenue multiple model  and a model based on a multiple of estimated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or the ebitda multiple model 
all of these valuation models involve significant assumptions regarding our future operating performance 
the following are the significant assumptions involved in each model dcf model assumptions regarding revenue growth rates  gross margin percentages  discount rates and terminal growth rates  revenue multiple model estimates of revenue growth and the selection of comparable companies to determine an appropriate multiple  and ebitda multiple model projected ebitda and the selection of comparable companies to determine an appropriate multiple

accordingly  changes in our assumptions related to the fair value of our enterprise networks business are most likely to result in an impairment charge in the future 
based on a sensitivity analysis  we changed certain significant assumptions in order to assess the impact on the value of our enterprise networks goodwill 
we determined that a decrease as high as in projected enterprise revenues  coupled with the assumption of no future enterprise networks revenue growth  would not trigger a goodwill impairment 
accordingly  a substantial change in our assumptions would be required before a goodwill impairment would be triggered 
in and  we concluded that an impairment of our goodwill did not exist and no write down was recorded 
in the first quarter of  we changed our reportable segments see business overview our segments 
we have determined that this change will trigger an interim impairment test as of march  we have not yet completed this impairment test  and as such  have not determined whether this change in our reportable segments will result in a goodwill impairment charge 
in  we incurred a goodwill write down of as a result of the continued decline in both our overall market value generally and within optical networks specifically  we evaluated the goodwill associated with the businesses within optical networks for potential impairment 
the conclusion of those evaluations was that the fair value associated with the businesses within optical networks could no longer support the carrying value of the remaining goodwill associated with them 
fair value was estimated using the then expected present value of discounted future cash flows of these businesses 
the discount rate used ranged from to and the terminal values were estimated based on terminal growth rates ranging from to 
the carrying value of goodwill was  as of december  and  as of december  the decrease in goodwill primarily related to the contribution of a portion of our dos business to voltdelta partially offset by our acquisition of the minority interests in our french and german operations

pension and post retirement benefits we maintain various pension and post retirement benefit plans for our employees globally 
these plans include significant pension and post retirement benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial valuations 
key assumptions are made in determining these obligations and related expenses  including expected rates of return on plan assets and discount rates 

table of contents for  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate pension expenses was on a weighted average basis  which was the rate determined at september  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets decreased from in the discount rates used to estimate the net pension obligations and expenses for were and  respectively  on a weighted average basis  compared to and  respectively  in the key assumptions used to estimate the post retirement costs for were an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of and a discount rate of and for the obligations and costs  respectively  both on a weighted average basis 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets decreased from in the discount rates for the obligations and costs decreased in to and  respectively  from and  respectively  in due to the decline experienced in global interest rates during through the difference between the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate reported for the net pension obligations and expenses and those rates reported for the net post retirement benefit obligations and costs is due to the weighted average calculation as a result of the number of countries in which we offer either pension or pension and post retirement benefits 
in developing these assumptions  we evaluated  among other things  input from our actuaries  expected long term market returns and current high quality bond rates 
changes in net periodic pension and post retirement benefit expense may occur in the future due to changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events 
the following table highlights the sensitivity of our pension and post retirement benefit expense to changes in these assumptions  assuming all other assumptions remain constant effect on pre tax effect on pre tax post retirement change in assumption pension expense benefit expense increase decrease increase decrease percentage point increase in the expected return on assets percentage point decrease in the expected return on assets percentage point increase in the discount rate percentage point decrease in the discount rate excludes settlement costs lump sum and termination payments to participants which discharges our obligations plan assets were primarily comprised of debt and equity securities 
included in the equity securities of the defined benefit plan were common shares of nortel networks corporation with an aggregate market value of of total plan assets as of december  and of total plan assets as of december  unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are being recognized over approximately a year period  which represents the weighted average expected remaining service life of the employee group 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on assets 
at the end of  we had unrecognized net actuarial losses related to the defined benefit plans of  which could result in an increase to pension expenses in future years depending on several factors  including whether such losses exceed the corridor in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
the post retirement benefit plans had unrecognized actuarial losses of at the end of the estimated accumulated benefit obligations for the defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of the plan assets at september  as a result of reductions in discount rates and changes in foreign exchange rates which more than offset the favorable impacts of strong pension asset returns and the voluntary contributions made by us during accordingly  we recorded a non cash charge of before tax to other comprehensive income for the minimum pension liability 
a similar charge may be required in the future as the impact of changes in global capital markets and interest rates on the value of our pension plan assets and obligations are measured 
during  we made cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans of  which excludes of deferred contributions for that were made in  and to our post retirement benefit plans 
in  we expect to make cash contributions of approximately to our defined benefit pension plans  and approximately to our post retirement benefit plans 

table of contents on december   the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  or the mpdim act  was signed into law in the us the mpdim act introduced a prescription drug benefit under medicare specifically  medicare part d as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
as permitted by fsp financial accounting standard  or fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  we chose to make the one time deferral election which remained in effect for our plans in the us until the earlier of the issuance of specific authoritative guidance by the fasb on how to account for the federal subsidy to be provided to plan sponsors under the mpdim act or the remeasurement of plan assets and obligations subsequent to january  on may   fsp fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  or fsp fas  was issued by the fasb to provide guidance relating to the prescription drug subsidy provided by the mpdim act 
we expect that all portions of our post retirement benefit plans qualify as actuarially equivalent to the benefit provided under the mpdim act  for which we expect to receive federal subsidies 
we adopted fsp fas in the second quarter of the financial impact of the federal subsidies was determined by remeasuring nortel retiree life and medical obligations as of december   as provided under the retroactive application provision of fsp fas as a result of adoption  the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation decreased by  and net periodic post retirement benefit costs decreased by for the year ended december  for  our expected rate of return on plan assets will remain at for defined benefit pension plans and will remain at for for post retirement benefit plans 
also for  we are lowering our discount rate on a weighted average basis for pension expenses from to for the defined benefit pension plans and from to for post retirement benefit plans given the declining trend in current global interest rates 
we will continue to evaluate our expected long term rates of return on plan assets and discount rates at least annually and make adjustments as necessary  which could change the pension and post retirement obligations and expenses in the future 
if the actual operation of the plans differs from the assumptions  additional contributions by us may be required 
if we are required to make significant contributions to fund the defined benefit plans  reported results could be materially and adversely affected and our cash flow available for other uses may be significantly reduced 
for additional information  see employee benefit plans in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
special charges in  we entered into an unprecedented period of business realignment in response to a significant adjustment in the industry 
we implemented a company wide restructuring plan to streamline our operations and activities around core markets and operations  which included significant workforce reductions  global real estate closures and dispositions  substantial write downs of our plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets and extensive contract settlements with customers and suppliers around the world 
as a result of these actions  our workforce declined significantly from january  to december  and over the same time period  we significantly reduced our facilities 
into  our focus is on managing each of our businesses based on financial performance  the market and customer priorities 
in the third quarter of  we announced a restructuring plan that includes a work plan involving focused workforce reductions  including a voluntary retirement program  of approximately  employees  real estate optimization and other cost containment actions such as reductions in information services costs  outsourced services and other discretionary spending across all segments but primarily in wireline networks and optical networks 
we record provisions for workforce reduction costs and exit costs when they are probable and estimable 
severance paid under ongoing benefit arrangements is recorded in accordance with sfas no 
employers accounting for post employment benefits 
one time termination benefits and contract settlement and lease costs are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
at each reporting date  we evaluate our accruals related to workforce reduction charges  contract settlement and lease costs and plant and equipment write downs to ensure that these accruals are still appropriate 
as of december   we had in accruals related to workforce reduction charges and in accruals related to contract settlement and lease costs  which included significant estimates  primarily related to sublease income over the lease terms and other costs for vacated properties 
in certain instances  we may determine that these accruals are no longer required because of efficiencies in carrying out our restructuring work plan 

table of contents adjustments to workforce reduction accruals may also be required when employees previously identified for separation do not receive severance payments because they are no longer employed by nortel or were redeployed due to circumstances not foreseen when the original plan was initiated 
in these cases  we reverse any related accrual to earnings when it is determined it is no longer required 
alternatively  in certain circumstances  we may determine that certain accruals are insufficient as new events occur or as additional information is obtained 
in these cases  we would increase the applicable existing accrual with the offset recorded against earnings 
increase or decreases to the accruals for changes in estimates are classified within special charges in the statement of operations 
other contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
as a result  we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss  in determining loss contingencies 
we recognize a reserve for an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
we are also subject to proceedings  lawsuits  investigations and other claims some of which may involve substantial dollar amounts  including proceedings under laws and government regulations related to securities  income and other taxes  environmental  labor  product and other matters 
in particular  our two restatements of our consolidated financial statements and related events have caused us to be subject to ongoing regulatory and criminal investigations and significant pending civil litigation actions in the us and canada 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes in any of these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is based on an analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
we cannot determine whether these matters will  individually or collectively  have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition

table of contents canadian supplement new canadian securities regulations and  as of march   amendments to the regulations under the canada business corporations act  allow issuers that are required to file reports with the sec  upon meeting certain conditions  to satisfy their canadian continuous disclosure obligations by using financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap 
we have provided the following supplemental information to highlight the significant differences that would have resulted in the md a had it been prepared using canadian gaap information 
the principal continuing reconciling differences that affect consolidated net earnings loss under canadian gaap are derivative accounting  financial instruments and goodwill impairment arising from historical differences in carrying value 
we adopted new canadian accounting standards for asset retirement obligations and for derivatives in and for vies in that are substantially consistent with us gaap 
also in  we elected to expense employee stock based compensation using the fair value based method for us gaap  which has resulted in no significant continuing reconciling difference for stock based compensation under canadian gaap 
other historical differences between us gaap and canadian gaap were primarily due to facts and circumstances related to prior years that are not expected to affect future earnings loss under canadian gaap  including business combinations 
see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation from u 
s gaap to canadian gaap  including a description of the material differences affecting our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated balance sheets 
there were no significant differences affecting the consolidated statements of cash flows 
accounting changes under canadian gaap  we adopted the following accounting changes as more fully described in note i of the accompanying consolidated financial statements derivative accounting effective january   we adopted accounting guideline  hedging relationships  or acg  which establishes specific criteria for derivatives to qualify for hedge accounting 
we had been previously applying these criteria under us gaap  therefore  there was no impact on adoption of acg concurrent with the adoption of acg  we also adopted the cica s emerging issues committee  or eic   accounting for trading  speculative or non hedging derivative financial instruments  or eic as a result of the adoption of eic  certain warrants  which had been previously recorded at cost under canadian gaap  are required to be recorded at fair value consistent with us gaap 
the impact of this accounting change  which has been recorded prospectively as at january   was an increase to investments and other income of during the year ended december  revenue recognition in december  the eic issued abstract  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eic eic was applicable to us beginning january  and was applied prospectively

the application of eic did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
asset retirement obligations under us gaap  we adopted sfas effective january   and recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax  within net earnings loss on the date of adoption 
we adopted similar canadian guidance  cica handbook section  asset retirement obligations  effective january   with retroactive restatement of prior periods 
under canadian gaap  the cumulative effect of adoption as of january  was recorded as an adjustment to opening accumulated deficit  as opposed to an adjustment within net earnings loss under us gaap  resulting in a difference of the retroactive adjustment to earnings for the year ended december  and under canadian gaap was not significant 
plant and equipment net  other liabilities and accumulated deficit as of december  have been increased by  and  respectively  to reflect the retroactive restatement 
stock based compensation in november  the cica issued handbook section  stock based compensation and other stock based payments  or section  which was revised in november section outlines a fair value based method of accounting required for certain stock based transactions  effective january   and applied to awards granted on or after that date 
prior to october   as permitted by section  we did not adopt the provisions in respect of the fair value based method of accounting for our employee stock based transactions 
on october   we elected to expense employee stock based compensation using the fair value based method prospectively for all awards granted  modified  or settled on or after january   in accordance with the transitional provisions of section and concurrent with the adoption of expense recognition under the fair value based method for us gaap 

table of contents restructuring charges under us gaap  effective january   we adopted sfas sfas requires that costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under canadian gaap  eic  accounting for severance and termination benefits  or eic  and eic  accounting for costs associated with exit and disposal activities including costs incurred in a restructuring  or eic  were issued to harmonize the canadian gaap requirement with sfas effective april   we adopted eic and eic impairment and disposal of long lived assets in may  the cica issued an updated section disposal of long lived assets and discontinued operations  or section in april  the cica issued handbook section  impairment of long lived assets  or section the adoption of sections and  which are substantially consistent with us gaap  did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
guarantees in february  the cica issued acg  disclosure of guarantees  or acg acg expands on previously issued accounting guidance and requires additional disclosure by a guarantor of information about each guarantee  or each group of similar guarantees  even when the likelihood of the guarantor having to make any payments under the guarantee is slight 
acg does not address the recognition or measurement of a guarantor s liability for obligations under a guarantee 
we adopted the requirements of acg effective january  which are substantially consistent with the disclosure requirements under us gaap for guarantees 
consolidation of vies in june  the cica issued acg  which is consistent with fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
acg clarifies the application of consolidation guidance to those entities defined as vies which includes  but is not limited to  special purpose entities  trusts  partnerships  certain joint ventures and other legal structures in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or there is not sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
the requirements of acg were effective for all annual and interim periods beginning on or after november  earlier application was encouraged and effective july   we adopted acg at the same time as equivalent guidance under us gaap and prospectively began consolidating two vies for which we were considered the primary beneficiary

market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our consolidated financial statements through adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
to manage the risk from these fluctuations  we enter into various derivative hedging transactions that we have authorized under our policies and procedures 
we maintain risk management control systems to monitor market risks and counterparty risks 
these systems rely on analytical techniques including both sensitivity analysis and value at risk estimations 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

table of contents additional disclosure of our financial instruments is included in financial instruments and hedging activities in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we manage foreign exchange exposures using forward and option contracts to hedge sale and purchase commitments 
our most significant foreign exchange exposures are in the canadian dollar  the british pound and the euro 
we enter into us to canadian dollar forward and option contracts intended to hedge the us to canadian dollar exposure on future revenues and expenditure streams 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  we recognize the gains and losses on the effective portion of these contracts in earnings when the hedged transaction occurs 
any ineffective portion of these contracts is recognized in earnings immediately 
we expect to continue to expand our business globally and  as such  expect that an increasing proportion of our business may be denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
as a result  fluctuations in foreign currencies may have a material impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we try to minimize the impact of such currency fluctuations through our ongoing commercial practices and by attempting to hedge our major currency exposures 
in attempting to manage this foreign exchange risk  we identify operations and transactions that may have exposure based upon the excess or deficiency of foreign currency receipts over foreign currency expenditures 
given our exposure to international markets  we regularly monitor all of our material foreign currency exposures 
our significant currency flows for the year ended december  were in us dollars  canadian dollars  british pounds and euros 
the net impact of foreign exchange fluctuations resulted in a currency exchange gains of in  a gain of in and a loss of in we cannot predict whether we will incur foreign exchange gains or losses in the future 
however  if significant foreign exchange losses are experienced  they could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we use sensitivity analysis to measure our foreign currency risk by computing the potential decrease in cash flows that may result from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates 
the balances are segregated by source currency  and a hypothetical unfavorable variance in foreign exchange rates of is applied to each net source currency position using year end rates  to determine the potential decrease in cash flows over the next year 
the sensitivity analysis includes all foreign currency denominated cash  short term and long term debt  and derivative instruments that will impact cash flows over the next year that are held at december  and  respectively 
the underlying cash flows that relate to the hedged firm commitments are not included in the analysis 
the analysis is performed at the reporting date and assumes no future changes in the balances or timing of cash flows from the year end position 
further  the model assumes no correlation in the movement of foreign exchange rates 
based on a one year time horizon  a adverse change in exchange rates would result in a potential decrease in after tax cash flows of as of december  and would have resulted in a potential decrease in after tax cash flows of as of december  this potential decrease would result primarily from our exposure to the canadian dollar  the british pound and the euro 
a portion of our long term debt is subject to changes in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates 
we have hedged a portion of this exposure to interest rate volatility using fixed for floating interest rate swaps 
the change in fair value of the swaps are recognized in earnings with offsetting amounts related to the change in the fair value of the hedged debt attributable to interest rate changes 
any ineffective portion of the swaps is recognized in income immediately 
we record net settlements on these swap instruments as adjustments to interest expense 
historically  we have managed interest rate exposures  as they relate to interest expense  using a diversified portfolio of fixed and floating rate instruments denominated in several major currencies 
we use sensitivity analysis to measure our interest rate risk 
the sensitivity analysis includes cash  our outstanding floating rate long term debt and any outstanding instruments that convert fixed rate long term debt to floating rate 
a basis point adverse change in interest rates would result in a potential decrease in cash flows of as of december  and would have resulted in a potential decrease in cash flows of as of december  equity price risk the values of our equity investments in several publicly traded companies are subject to market price volatility 
these investments are generally in companies in the technology industry sector and are classified as available for sale 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate the market exposure on these investment securities 
we also hold certain derivative instruments or warrants that are subject to market price volatility because their value is based on the common share price of a publicly traded company 
these derivative instruments are generally acquired through business acquisitions or divestitures 

table of contents in addition  derivative instruments may also be purchased to hedge exposure to certain compensation obligations that vary based on future nortel networks corporation common share prices 
we do not hold equity securities or derivative instruments for trading purposes 
as of december   a hypothetical adverse change in the stock prices of our publicly traded equity securities and the related underlying stock prices of publicly traded equity securities for certain of our derivative instruments would result in a loss in their aggregate fair value of this includes a loss of related to derivative instruments that were purchased to hedge exposure to compensation obligations 
as of december   a hypothetical adverse change in the stock prices of our publicly traded equity securities and the related underlying stock prices of publicly traded equity securities for certain of our derivative instruments would result in a loss in their aggregate fair value of this includes a loss of related to derivative instruments that were purchased to hedge exposure to compensation obligations

table of contents risks relating to our restatements and related matters our two restatements of our consolidated financial statements and related events have had  and will continue to have  a material adverse effect on us 
in may  we commenced certain balance sheet reviews at the direction of certain members of former management that led to the comprehensive review  which resulted in the first restatement 
in late october  the audit committee initiated the independent review and engaged wcphd to advise it in connection with the independent review 
the audit committee sought to gain a full understanding of the events that caused significant excess liabilities to be maintained on the balance sheet that needed to be restated  and to recommend that our board of directors adopt  and direct management to implement  necessary remedial measures to address personnel  controls  compliance and discipline 
as the independent review progressed  the audit committee directed new corporate management to examine in depth the concerns identified by wcphd regarding provisioning activity and to review certain provision releases 
that examination  and other errors identified by management  led to the second restatement and our revision of previously announced unaudited results for the year ended december  the need for the second restatement resulted in delays in filing the reports 
over the course of the second restatement process  management identified certain accounting practices that it determined should be adjusted as part of the second restatement 
in particular  management identified certain errors related to revenue recognition and undertook a process of revenue reviews 
in light of the resulting adjustments to revenues previously reported  the audit committee has determined to review the facts and circumstances leading to the restatement of these revenues for specific transactions identified in the second restatement 
the review has a particular emphasis on the underlying conduct that led to the initial recognition of these revenues 
the audit committee is seeking a full understanding of the historic events that required the revenues for these specific transactions to be restated and will consider any appropriate additional remedial measures  including those involving internal controls and processes 
the audit committee has engaged wcphd to advise it in connection with this review 
for more information on the comprehensive review  independent review  first restatement  second restatement and revenue independent review  see the md a and controls and procedures sections of this report 
as a result of these events  we have become subject to the following key risks  each of which is described in more detail below 
each of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
we are subject to ongoing regulatory and criminal investigations in the us and canada  which could require us to pay substantial fines or other penalties 
we are subject to significant pending civil litigation  which if decided against us  could require us to pay substantial judgments  settlements or other penalties and could result in the potential dilution of our common shares 
material adverse legal judgments  fines  penalties or settlements could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity  which could be very significant 
we cannot predict the outcome of the revenue independent review being undertaken by our audit committee 
we and our independent auditors have identified a number of material weaknesses related to our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is ineffective  which could continue to impact our ability to report our results of operations and financial condition accurately and in a timely manner 
the governing principles of the independent review particularly as they relate to remedial measures may take time to implement 
the delayed filing of our reports and related matters caused us to breach our public debt indentures and seek waivers from edc under the edc support facility  which may affect our liquidity 
as a result of the expected delay in filing the first quarter reports  we and nnl will not be in compliance with our obligations to deliver the first quarter reports to the trustees under our and nnl s public debt indentures if such reports are filed after may  in such event  it is possible that the holders of our public debt will seek to accelerate the maturity of that debt 
in addition  it is possible that edc will not grant us additional waivers 

table of contents our credit ratings have been downgraded  we are currently unable to access in its current form our shelf registration statement filed with the sec and we terminated the five year facilities  each of which may affect our liquidity 
the expected delay in filing of the first quarter reports could cause the tsx and or the nyse to commence suspension or delisting procedures in respect of nortel networks corporation s common shares or other of our or nnl s listed securities 
continuing negative publicity may adversely affect our business and the market price of our publicly traded securities 
we may not be able to attract or retain the personnel necessary to achieve our business objectives 
ongoing sec review may require us to amend our public disclosures further 
we are subject to ongoing regulatory and criminal investigations in the us and canada  which could require us to pay substantial fines or other penalties 
we are under investigation by the sec and the osc 
on april   we announced that the sec had issued a formal order of investigation in connection with our previous restatement of financial results for certain periods and our announcements in march regarding the likely need to revise certain previously announced results and restate previously filed financial results for one or more earlier periods 
on april   we announced that we had received a letter from the staff of the osc advising us of an osc enforcement staff investigation into the same matters that are the subject of the sec investigation 
we have also received a us federal grand jury subpoena for the production of certain documents sought in connection with an ongoing criminal investigation being conducted by the us attorney s office for the northern district of texas  dallas division 
further  on august   we received a letter from the integrated market enforcement team of the rcmp advising us that it would be commencing a criminal investigation into our financial accounting situation 
our senior management and board of directors have been required to devote significant time to these investigations and related matters 
we cannot predict when these investigations will be completed  nor can we predict what the results of these investigations may be 
expenses incurred in connection with these investigations which include substantial fees of lawyers and other professional advisors and potential obligations to indemnify officers and directors who may be parties to such actions could adversely affect our cash position 
we may be required to pay material fines  consent to injunctions on future conduct or suffer other penalties  each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
the investigations may adversely affect our ability to obtain  and or increase the cost of obtaining  directors and officers liability insurance and or other types of insurance  which could have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the findings and outcomes of the independent review  the revenue independent review and the regulatory and criminal investigations may affect the course of the civil litigation pending against us  which are more fully described below 
the effects and results of these or other investigations may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
we are subject to significant pending civil litigation  which if decided against us  could require us to pay substantial judgments  settlements or other penalties and could potentially result in the dilution of our common shares 
in addition to being subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business  we are currently  and may in the future be  subject to class actions  other securities litigation and other actions arising in relation to our accounting restatements 
subsequent to our march  announcement of the likely need for the second restatement  numerous class action complaints  including erisa class action complaints and a derivative action complaint  have been filed against nortel and certain current and former officers and directors 
we expect that this litigation will be time consuming  expensive and distracting from the conduct of our daily business 
the adverse resolution of any specific lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our ability to favorably resolve other lawsuits and on our financial condition and liquidity 
we are unable at this time to estimate what our ultimate liability in these matters may be  and it is possible that we will be required to pay substantial judgments  settlements or other penalties and incur expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business  results 
table of contents of operations  financial condition and liquidity  and such effects could be very significant 
in addition  the resolution of those matters may require us to issue additional common shares  which could potentially result in the dilution of our common shares 
expenses incurred in connection with these matters which include substantial fees of lawyers and other professional advisors and potential obligations to indemnify officers and directors who may be parties to such actions could adversely affect our cash position 
material adverse legal judgments  fines  penalties or settlements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity  which could be very significant 
we estimate that as of december  our available cash and our cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund our operations and service our debt for at least the next twelve months 
in making this estimate  we have not assumed the need to make any payments in connection with our pending civil litigation or investigations related to the first restatement and second restatement  other than our anticipated professional fees and expenses 
we believe that we have sufficient cash to repay our long term debt of  relating to nnl s notes due february however  we continue to routinely monitor the capital markets for opportunities to improve our capital structure and financial flexibility 
we can provide no assurances that any capital markets transactions will be completed on favorable terms  or at all 
any material adverse legal judgments  fines  penalties or settlements arising from the pending civil litigation and investigations could require additional funding which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity  including by requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash and cash flow from operations to payments of such judgments  fines  penalties or settlements  thereby reducing the availability of our cash and or cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  r d efforts and other general corporate purposes  including debt reduction  making it more difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness  increasing the difficulty and or cost to us of refinancing our indebtedness  increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate  making it more difficult for us to make acquisitions and investments  limiting our ability to obtain  and or increase the cost of obtaining  directors and officers liability insurance and or other types of insurance  and restricting our ability to introduce new technologies and products and or exploit business opportunities 
we cannot predict the outcome of the revenue independent review being undertaken by our audit committee 
as discussed in greater detail in the controls and procedures section of this report  our audit committee initiated the revenue independent review to achieve a full understanding of the historic events that required revenues for certain specific transactions to be restated 
the revenue independent review has a particular emphasis on the underlying conduct that led to the initial recognition of these revenues 
the review will also consider any appropriate additional remedial measures  including those involving internal controls and processes 
the audit committee has engaged wcphd to advise it in connection with this review 
we cannot predict the outcome of the revenue independent review 
we and our independent auditors have identified a number of material weaknesses related to our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is ineffective  which could continue to impact our ability to report our results of operations and financial condition accurately and in a timely manner 
two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting were identified at the time of the first restatement 
over the course of second restatement  we and deloitte identified a number of additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
deloitte confirmed to the audit committee these material weaknesses  listed below  on january  
table of contents lack of compliance with written nortel procedures for monitoring and adjusting balances related to certain accruals and provisions  including restructuring charges and contract and customer accruals  lack of compliance with nortel procedures for applying applicable gaap to the initial recording of certain liabilities  including those described in sfas no 
 and to foreign currency translation as described in sfas no 
 lack of sufficient personnel with appropriate knowledge  experience and training in us gaap and lack of sufficient analysis and documentation of the application of us gaap to transactions  including  but not limited to  revenue transactions  lack of a clear organization and accountability structure within the accounting function  including insufficient review and supervision  combined with financial reporting systems that are not integrated and which require extensive manual interventions  lack of sufficient awareness of  and timely and appropriate remediation of  internal control issues by nortel personnel  and an inappropriate tone at the top  which contributed to the lack of a strong control environment  as reported in the independent review summary set forth in item a of the annual reports  there was a management tone at the top that conveyed the strong leadership message that earnings targets could be met through application of accounting practices that finance managers knew or ought to have known were not in compliance with us gaap and that questioning these practices was not acceptable 
our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  pursuant to sox and the related sec rules and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december  specifically  they concluded that the first five of these six material weaknesses continue to exist and existed as of december  deloitte has also assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  and has also concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december  we continue to identify  develop and implement remedial measures to address these material weaknesses 
these material weaknesses  if not fully addressed  could result in accounting errors such as those underlying the restatements of our consolidated financial statements more fully discussed in developments in and nortel audit committee independent review  restatements  related matters in the md a and controls and procedures section of this report 
while our board of directors has approved the adoption of all of the recommendations for remedial measures contained in the summary of findings and of recommended remedial measures of the independent review in the controls and procedures section of our annual report on form k  and our management has adopted a number of measures to strengthen our internal control over financial reporting and address the material weaknesses identified above  we may be unable to address such material weaknesses in a timely manner  which could adversely impact the accuracy and timeliness of future reports and filings we make with the sec and osc 
while we are implementing steps to ensure the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  failure to restore the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could continue to impact our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations accurately and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
the governing principles of the independent review for remedial measures may take time to implement 
as a result of the independent review  a number of significant remedial steps have been identified as necessary to improve our process and procedures 
these remedial steps may take time to implement 
in addition  the process of implementing the governing principles of the independent review may be time consuming for our senior management and disrupt our business 

table of contents the delayed filing of our reports and related matters caused us to breach our public debt indentures and seek waivers from edc under the edc support facility  which may affect our liquidity 
as a result of the expected delay in filing the first quarter reports  we and nnl will not be in compliance with our obligations to deliver the first quarter reports to the trustees under our and nnl s public debt indentures if such reports are filed after may  in addition  the delay in filing the reports and the expected delay in filing the first quarter reports and related matters has resulted and we expect will result in a breach of our obligations under the edc support facility 
it is possible that the holders of our public debt will seek to accelerate the maturity of that debt and edc will not grant nnl a further waiver 
as a result of the delayed filing of the reports  we and nnl breached our obligations to deliver the reports to the trustees under our and nnl s public debt indentures 
with the filing of the annual reports with the sec and the delivery of the annual reports to the trustees under our and nnl s public debt indentures  we and nnl will be in compliance with our delivery obligations under the public debt indentures 
however  as a result of the expected delay in filing the first quarter reports  we and nnl will not be in compliance with our obligations to deliver the first quarter reports to the trustees under our and nnl s public debt indentures if such reports are filed after may  any non compliance with the delivery obligations under the public debt indentures with respect to the first quarter reports will not result in an automatic event of default and acceleration of the outstanding long term debt and such default and acceleration could not occur unless notice of such non compliance from holders of of the outstanding principal amount of any relevant series of debt securities is provided to us or nnl  as applicable  and we or nnl  as applicable  failed to deliver the first quarter reports within days after such notice is provided  all in accordance with the terms of the indentures 
while such notice could have been given at any time after march  as a result of the delayed filings of the reports  neither we nor nnl has received a notice to the date of this report 
if notice were given with respect to the delayed filing of the first quarter reports and acceleration of our and nnl s debt securities were to occur  we may be unable to meet our payment obligations 
if notice were given  we believe that it is probable that we and nnl would file and deliver the first quarter reports within days of receipt of such a notice 
as a result of the delayed filing of our reports and the related breaches  we were also required to seek waivers from edc under the edc support facility 
on april   nnl obtained a new waiver from edc of certain defaults and related breaches by nnl under the edc support facility 
the new waiver remains in effect until the earliest of certain events including the date on which we and nnl have filed the annual reports and the first quarter reports  or may  if we and nnl fail to file the first quarter reports by may   edc will have the right absent a further waiver to terminate the edc support facility  exercise certain rights against collateral or require nnl to cash collateralize all existing support 
in addition  the related breaches will continue beyond the filing of the annual reports and the first quarter reports 
accordingly  beginning on the earlier of the date upon which we and nnl file the annual reports and the first quarter reports with the sec and may   edc will have the right to terminate or suspend the edc support facility notwithstanding the filing of the annual reports and the first quarter reports 
while nnl intends to seek a permanent waiver from edc in connection with the related breaches  there can be no assurance that nnl will receive any waiver or as to the terms of any such waiver 
any future delay in the filing of our periodic reports with the sec would similarly result in a breach of our public debt indentures and require us to seek additional waivers from edc under the edc support facility  which could reduce our access to the edc support facility and may adversely affect our liquidity 
edc may not grant an additional waiver and the terms of such a waiver may be unfavorable 
our credit ratings have been downgraded  we are currently unable to access our shelf registration statement filed with the sec and nnl terminated the five year facilities  each of which may adversely affect our liquidity 
on april   s p downgraded its ratings of nnl  including its long term corporate credit rating from b to b and its preferred share rating from ccc to ccc 
at the same time  it revised its outlook to developing from negative 
moody s current long term debt rating for nnl is b and its preferred share rating is caa 
on april   moody s changed its outlook to potential downgrade from uncertain 
these ratings are below investment grade 
our credit ratings could be lowered or rating agencies could issue adverse commentaries in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
these ratings and our current credit condition affect  among other things  our ability to raise debt  access the commercial paper market which is currently closed to us  engage in alternative financing arrangements  obtain bank financings and affect our ability  and the cost to securitize receivables  obtain customer bid  performance related and other bonds and contracts  access the edc support facility and or enter into normal course derivative or hedging transactions and also affect the price of our stock 

table of contents as a result of a ratings downgrade in  security agreements became effective under which substantially all of nnl s assets located in the us and canada and those of most of our us and canadian subsidiaries  including the shares of certain of nnl s us and canadian subsidiaries  were pledged 
in addition  certain of nnl s wholly owned subsidiaries have guaranteed nnl s obligations under the edc support facility and nnl s and nortel s outstanding debt securities 
these agreements will continue to secure the edc support facility and our and nnl s outstanding public debt until the edc support facility expires  alternative collateral is provided  or nnl s public debt ratings return to at least bbb with a stable outlook by s p and baa stable outlook by moody s 
the continued existence of these security arrangements may adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt or obtain alternative financing arrangements 
in addition  edc is not obligated to make any support available under the edc support facility if nnl s senior long term rating by moody s is downgraded to less than b or if its debt rating by s p is downgraded to less than b 
in addition  in april  nnl terminated the five year facilities 
absent this termination  the banks would have been permitted  upon days notice  to terminate their commitments under the five year facilities as a result of nnl s failure to file the nnl annual report on form k by april  although the five year facilities were undrawn at termination  this termination may adversely affect our liquidity 
further  as a result of the delayed filing of the reports and the expected delay in filing the first quarter reports  we are unable to use  in its current form  the remaining approximately of capacity under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec for various types of securities 
as a result  our ability to access the capital markets is constrained  which may adversely affect our liquidity 
the expected delay in filing of our first quarter reports could cause the toronto stock exchange and or the new york stock exchange to commence suspension or delisting procedures in respect of nortel networks corporation common shares or other of our or nnl s listed securities 
as a result of the delay in filing the reports and the expected delay in filing the first quarter reports  we were and expect to be  in breach of the continued listing requirements of the nyse and tsx 
the expected delay in filing of our first quarter reports could cause the tsx or nyse to commence suspension or delisting procedures in respect of our or nnl s listed securities 
the commencement of any suspension or delisting procedures by either exchange remains  at all times  at the discretion of such exchange and would be publicly announced by the exchange 
if a suspension or delisting were to occur  there would be significantly less liquidity in the suspended or delisted securities 
in addition  our ability to raise additional necessary capital through equity or debt financing  and attract and retain personnel by means of equity compensation  would be greatly impaired 
furthermore  with respect to any suspended or delisted securities  we would expect decreases in institutional and other investor demand  analyst coverage  market making activity and information available concerning trading prices and volume  and fewer broker dealers would be willing to execute trades with respect to such securities 
a suspension or delisting would likely decrease the attractiveness of nortel networks corporation common shares or other listed securities of nortel networks corporation and nnl to investors and cause the trading volume of nortel networks corporation common shares or other listed securities of nortel networks corporation and nnl to decline  which could result in a decline in the market price of such securities 
continuing negative publicity may adversely affect our business and the market price of our publicly traded securities 
as a result of the first restatement and second restatement  we have been the subject of continuing negative publicity 
this negative publicity has contributed to significant declines in the prices of our publicly traded securities 
this negative publicity may have an effect on the terms under which some customers and suppliers are willing to continue to do business with us and could affect our financial performance or financial condition 
we also believe that many of our employees are operating under stressful conditions  which reduce morale and could lead to increased employee turnover 
continuing negative publicity could have a material adverse effect on our business and the market price of our publicly traded securities 
as a result of the delay in the filing of the annual reports containing our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   we were required to apply to the ontario superior court of justice for an order permitting the postponement of our annual shareholders meeting  or the meeting 
the ontario superior court of justice granted that order  which permitted us to extend the time for calling the meeting to a date not later than june  the order permits us to comply with a specific sec rule which would require us  in our circumstances  to provide to shareholders our audited financial statements either prior to or concurrently with the mailing of proxy materials for the meeting 
this postponement has  among other things  contributed to the continuing negative publicity related to us  which may adversely affect our business and the market price of our publicly traded securities 

table of contents we may not be able to attract or retain the personnel necessary to achieve our business objectives 
competition for certain key positions and specialized technical personnel in the high technology industry remains strong 
our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire  assimilate in a timely manner and retain qualified personnel  particularly in key senior management positions and in our key areas of potential growth 
an important factor in attracting and retaining qualified employees is our ability to provide employees with the opportunity to participate in the potential growth of our business through programs such as stock option plans  restricted stock unit plans and employee investment and share purchase plans 
the scope and value of these programs will be adversely affected by the volatility or negative performance of the market price for nortel networks corporation s common shares 
in connection with the delay in filing our annual reports  as of march   we suspended the purchase of nortel networks corporation common shares under the stock purchase plans for eligible employees in eligible countries that facilitate the acquisition of nortel networks corporation common shares  the exercise of outstanding options granted under the plan or the plan  or the grant of any additional options under those plans  or the exercise of outstanding options granted under employee stock option plans previously assumed by us in connection with mergers and acquisitions  and the purchase of units in nortel s stock fund or purchase of nortel networks corporation common shares under our defined contribution and investments plans until such time as  at the earliest  we are in compliance with us and canadian regulatory securities filing requirements 
on may   the osc issued a final order prohibiting all trading by our directors  officers and certain current and former employees in nortel networks corporation s securities and those of nnl 
this order will remain in effect until two full business days following the receipt by the osc of all filings required to be made by us and nnl pursuant to ontario securities law 
accordingly  our ability to provide employees with the opportunity to participate in nortel stock option plans  restricted stock unit plans and employee investment and share purchase plans has been adversely affected and certain employees have not been able to trade in our securities 
the current suspension of these programs and osc trading order  and any future suspension or osc order  may have a material adverse effect on our ability to hire  assimilate in a timely manner and retain qualified personnel 
in addition  in we terminated for cause our former president and chief executive officer  former chief financial officer  former controller and seven additional individuals with significant responsibilities for financial reporting 
we have also commenced litigation against our former president and chief executive officer  former chief financial officer and former controller  seeking the return of payments made to them under our bonus plan in in august and september  as part of our new strategic plan  we announced an anticipated workforce reduction of approximately  employees 
approximately of employee actions related to the focused workforce reduction were completed by the end of  including approximately that were notified of termination or acceptance of voluntary retirement  with the remainder comprised of voluntary attrition of employees that were not replaced 
the remainder of employee actions are expected to be completed by june  in addition  in  and  we implemented a company wide restructuring plan  which included a reduction of approximately two thirds of our workforce over the three year period 
we may find it more difficult to attract or retain qualified employees because of our recent significant workforce reductions  business performance  management changes  restatement activities and resulting negative publicity and the resulting impacts on our incentive programs and incentive compensation plans 
if we have not properly sized our workforce and retained those employees with the appropriate skills  our ability to compete effectively may be adversely affected 
we are also more dependent on those employees we have retained  as many have taken on increased responsibilities due to workforce reductions 
if we are not successful in attracting  recruiting or retaining qualified employees  including members of senior management  we may not have the personnel necessary to achieve our business objectives  including the implementation of our remedial measures 
ongoing sec review may require us to amend our public disclosures further 
we have received comments on our periodic filings from the staff of the sec s division of corporation finance 
as part of this comment process  we may receive further comments from the staff of the sec relating to this annual report on form k and our other periodic filings 
as a result  we may be required by the sec to amend this form k or other reports filed with the sec in order to make adjustments or additional disclosures 

table of contents risks relating to our business we continue to restructure our business to respond to industry and market conditions 
the assumptions underlying our restructuring efforts may prove to be inaccurate and we may have to restructure our business again in the future 
we continue to restructure our business to realign resources and achieve desired cost savings in an increasingly competitive market 
our new strategic plan includes an anticipated further workforce reduction of approximately  employees 
we have based our restructuring efforts on certain assumptions regarding the cost structure of our business 
our current assumptions may or may not be correct and as a result  we may determine that further restructuring in the future will be needed 
our restructuring efforts may not be sufficient for us to achieve improved results and meet the changes in industry and market conditions  including increased competition 
in particular  we face increased competition from low cost competitors such as huawei technologies co  ltd 
and zte corporation 
we must manage the potentially higher growth areas of our business  as well as the non core areas  in order for us to achieve improved results 
we have made  and will continue to make  judgments as to whether we should further reduce our workforce or exit  or dispose of  certain businesses 
these workforce reductions may impair our ability to achieve our current or future business objectives 
costs incurred in connection with restructuring efforts may be higher than estimated 
any decision by management to further limit investment or exit  or dispose of  businesses may result in the recording of additional charges 
as a result  the costs actually incurred in connection with the restructuring efforts may be higher than originally planned and may not lead to the anticipated cost savings and or improved results 
as part of our review of restructured businesses  we look at the recoverability of their tangible and intangible assets 
future market conditions may trigger further write downs of these assets due to uncertainties in the estimates and assumptions used in asset valuations  which are based on our forecasts of future business performance  and accounting estimates related to the useful life and recoverability of the net book value of these assets  including inventory  goodwill  net deferred taxes and other intangible assets 
we will continue to review our restructuring work plan based on our ongoing assessment of the industry and the business environment 
our operating results have historically been subject to yearly and quarterly fluctuations and are expected to continue to fluctuate  which may adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities 
our operating results have historically been  and are expected to continue to be  subject to quarterly and yearly fluctuations as a result of a number of factors 
these factors include our ability to execute our strategic plan  including the planned workforce reductions  without negatively impacting our relationships with our customers  the delivery of products based on new and developing technologies at competitive prices  the effectiveness of our internal processes and organizations and the retention of qualified personnel  our ability to focus on the day to day operation of our business while implementing improvements in our internal controls and procedures  including our accounting systems  and addressing the civil litigation actions and investigations related to our restatements  our ability to successfully implement programs to stimulate customer spending by anticipating and offering the kinds of products and services customers will require in the future to increase the efficiency and profitability of their networks  our ability to successfully complete programs on a timely basis to reduce our cost structure  including fixed costs  to streamline our operations and to reduce product costs  our ability to successfully manage our manufacturing operations  which are substantially outsourced to contract manufacturers  our ability to successfully comply with increased and complex regulations  our ability to focus our business on what we believe to be potentially higher growth  higher margin businesses and to dispose of or exit non core businesses  increased price and product competition in the networking industry  including from low cost competitors  our ability to compete with low cost competitors  including those offering attractive customer financing arrangements  the inherent uncertainties of using forecasts  estimates and assumptions for asset valuations and in determining the amounts of accrued liabilities  provisions and other items in our consolidated financial statements  
table of contents the impact of changes in global capital markets and interest rates on our pension plan assets and obligations  fluctuations in our gross margins  the development  introduction and market acceptance of new technologies  and integrated networking solutions  as well as the adoption of new networking standards  the overall trend toward industry consolidation and rationalization among our customers  competitors and suppliers  our ability to make investments  including acquisitions  to strengthen our business  the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing to fund capital expenditures  variations in sales channels  product costs and the mix of products sold  the size and timing of customer orders and shipments  our ability to obtain payment from customers on a timely basis  our ability to continue to obtain customer performance bonds and contracts  our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels  the impact of acquired businesses and technologies  our ability to fund and sustain our research and development activities  the impact of our product development schedules  product quality variances  manufacturing capacity and lead times required to produce our products  and the impact of higher insurance premiums and deductibles and greater limitations on insurance coverage 
our decision to adopt fair value accounting for employee stock options on a prospective basis as of january  has caused us to record an expense over the stock option vesting period  based on the fair value at the date the options are granted  and could have a significant negative effect on our reported results 
additionally  we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances  to value our deferred tax assets and to partially accrue unfunded pension liabilities  each of which may result in a negative effect on our reported results 
we enter into agreements that may require us to make certain indemnification payments to third parties in the event of certain changes in an underlying economic characteristic related to assets  liabilities or equity securities of such third parties 
the occurrence of events that may cause us to become liable to make an indemnification payment is not within our control and an obligation to make a significant indemnification payment under such agreements could have a significant negative effect on our reported results 
as a consequence  operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict  and therefore  prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods 
any of the foregoing factors  or any other factors described herein  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition that could adversely affect the price of our publicly traded securities 
global economic conditions and other trends and factors affecting the telecommunications industry are beyond our control and may result in reduced demand and pricing pressure on our products 
there are trends and factors affecting the industry that are beyond our control and may affect our operations 
these trends and factors include adverse changes in the public and private equity and debt markets and our ability  as well as the ability of our customers and suppliers  to obtain financing or to fund working capital and capital expenditures  adverse changes in the credit quality of our customers and suppliers  adverse changes in the market conditions in our industry and the specific markets for our products  the trend towards the sale of converged networking solutions  which could lead to reduced capital spending on multiple networks by our customers  visibility to  and the actual size and timing of  capital expenditures by our customers  inventory practices  including the timing of product and service deployment  of our customers  the amount of network capacity and the network capacity utilization rates of our customers  and the amount of sharing and or acquisition of new and or existing network capacity by our customers  
table of contents policies of our customers regarding utilization of single or multiple vendors for the products they purchase  the overall trend toward industry consolidation and rationalization among our customers  competitors and suppliers  conditions in the broader market for communications products  including data networking products and computerized information access equipment and services  increased price competition  particularly from low cost competitors  changes in legislation or accounting rules and governmental and environmental regulation or intervention affecting communications or data networking  computer viruses  break ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems  and acts of war or terrorism that could lead to disruptions in general global economic activity  changes in logistics and security arrangements and reduced customer demand for our products and services 
cautious capital spending in our industry has affected  and could affect  demand for  or pricing pressures on  our products 
our gross margins may decline  which would reduce our operating results and could contribute to volatility in the market price of our publicly traded securities 
our gross margins may be negatively affected as a result of a number of factors  including increased price competition  particularly from low cost competitors  increased industry consolidation among our customers  which may lead to decreased demand for  and downward pricing pressure on the prices of  our products  changes in product and geographic mix  customer and contract settlement costs  higher product  material or labor costs  increased inventory provisions or contract and customer settlement costs  warranty costs  obsolescence charges  loss of cost savings on future inventory purchases as a result of high inventory levels  introduction of new products and costs of entering new markets  increased levels of customer services  changes in distribution channels  excess capacity or excess fixed assets  accruals for employee incentive bonuses  further restructuring costs  and costs related to our restatements  including the possibility of substantial fines  settlements and or damages or other penalties  and or remedial actions 
lower than expected gross margins would negatively affect our operating results and could contribute to volatility in the market price of our publicly traded securities 
cash flow fluctuations may affect our ability to fund our working capital requirements or achieve our business objectives in a timely manner 
additional sources of funds may not be available or may not be available on acceptable terms 
our working capital requirements and cash flows historically have been  and are expected to continue to be  subject to quarterly and yearly fluctuations  depending on such factors as timing and size of capital expenditures  levels of sales  timing of deliveries and collection of receivables  inventory levels  customer payment terms  customer financing obligations and supplier terms and conditions 
in addition  if the industry or our current condition deteriorates  notwithstanding the edc support facility  an increased portion of our cash and cash equivalents may be restricted as cash collateral for customer performance bonds and contracts 
as of december   we believe our cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our current business model  manage our investments and meet our customer commitments for at least the next months 
in making this estimate  we have not made provision for any material payments in connection with our pending civil litigation actions and investigations related to the first restatement and second restatement  other than our anticipated professional 
table of contents fees and expenses 
we believe that we have sufficient cash to repay our long term debt of  relating to nnl s notes due february however  we continue to routinely monitor the capital markets for opportunities to improve our capital structure and financial flexibility 
we can provide no assurances that any capital markets transactions will be completed on favorable terms  or at all 
any material adverse legal judgments  fines  penalties or settlements arising from these pending civil litigation actions and investigations could require additional funding which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
this could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  which could be very significant 
in addition  a greater than expected slow down in capital spending by service providers and other customers may require us to adjust our current business model 
as a result  our revenues and cash flows may be materially lower than we expect and we may be required to further reduce our capital expenditures and investments or take other measures in order to meet our cash requirements 
we may seek additional funds from liquidity generating transactions and other sources of external financing which may include a variety of debt  convertible debt and or equity financings 
we cannot provide any assurance that our net cash requirements will be as we currently expect  that we will continue to have access to the edc support facility when and as needed  or that liquidity generating transactions or financings will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
our inability to manage cash flow fluctuations resulting from the above factors and the potential reduction  expiry or termination of the edc support facility could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our working capital requirements from operating cash flows and other sources of liquidity or to achieve our business objectives in a timely manner 
we may be materially and adversely affected by cautious capital spending by our customers 
increased consolidation among our customers and the loss of customers in certain markets could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our consolidated revenues in were slightly lower compared to continued cautiousness in capital spending by service providers and other customers may affect our revenues more than we currently expect 
our revenues and operating results have been and may continue to be materially and adversely affected by the continued cautiousness in capital spending by our customers 
we have focused on the larger customers in certain markets  which provide a substantial portion of our revenues 
increased industry consolidation among our customers may lead to downward pressure on the prices of our products  or reduced spending  a loss  reduction or delay in business from one or more of these customers 
such increased industry consolidation among our customers  reduced spending  a loss  reduction or delay in business from one or more of these customers  or a failure to achieve a significant market share with these customers  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our business may be materially and adversely affected by our high level of debt 
in order to finance our business  we have incurred significant levels of debt compared to historical levels  and we may need to obtain additional sources of funding  which may include debt or convertible debt financing  in the future 
a high level of debt  arduous or restrictive terms and conditions related to accessing certain sources of funding  failure to meet the covenants in the edc support facility and any significant reduction in  or access to  such facility  poor business performance or lower than expected cash inflows could materially and adversely affect our ability to fund the operation of our business 
other effects of a high level of debt include the following we may have difficulty borrowing money in the future or accessing other sources of funding  a high debt level may affect our ability to refinance our existing debt  including the  of long term debt relating to nnl s notes due february  we may need to use a large portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness  which would reduce the amount of cash available to finance our operations and other business activities  a high debt level  arduous or restrictive terms and conditions  or lower than expected cash flows would make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business  and if operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our operating expenses  capital expenditures and debt service requirements as they become due  we may be required  in order to meet our debt service obligations  to delay or reduce capital expenditures or the introduction of new products  sell assets and or forego business opportunities including acquisitions  research and development projects or product design enhancements 

table of contents an increased portion of our cash and cash equivalents may be restricted as cash collateral if we are unable to secure alternative support for certain obligations arising out of our normal course business activities 
the edc support facility may not provide all the support we require for certain of our obligations arising out of our normal course of business activities 
in particular  although this facility provides for up to in support  the revolving small bond sub facility will not become committed support until the first quarter reports are filed with the sec and nnl obtains a permanent waiver of the related breaches 
as of april   there was approximately of outstanding support utilized under the edc support facility  approximately of which was outstanding under the small bond sub facility 
in addition  bid and performance related bonds with terms that extend beyond december   which  absent any early termination of the edc support facility  is the expiry date of this facility  are currently not eligible for the support provided by the edc support facility 
given that the edc support facility is used to support bid and performance bonds with varying terms  including those with at least days  we may need to increase our use of cash collateral to support these obligations beginning on january  absent a further extension of the facility 
unless edc agrees to extend the facility or agrees to provide support outside the scope of the facility  we may be required to provide cash collateral to support these obligations 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will reach an agreement with edc on these matters 
under the terms of the waiver letter with edc dated march   edc may also suspend its obligation to issue nnl any additional support if events occur that have a material adverse effect on nnl s business  financial position or results of operations 
if we do not have access to sufficient support under the edc support facility  and if we are unable to secure alternative support  an increased portion of our cash and cash equivalents may be restricted as cash collateral  which could adversely affect our ability to fund some of our normal course business activities  capital expenditures  r d and our ability to borrow in the future 
an inability of our subsidiaries to provide us with funding in sufficient amounts could adversely affect our ability to meet our obligations 
we may at times depend primarily on loans  dividends or other forms of financing from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations to pay interest and principal on outstanding public debt and to pay corporate expenses 
if our subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or provide us with loans or other forms of financing in sufficient amounts  it could adversely affect our ability to meet our obligations 
we may need to make larger contributions to our defined benefit plans in the future 
we currently maintain various defined benefit plans in north america and the uk which cover various categories of employees and retirees  which represent our major retirement plans 
in addition  we have smaller retirement plans in other countries 
our obligations to make contributions to fund benefit obligations under these plans are based on actuarial valuations  which themselves are based on certain assumptions about the long term operation of the plans  including employee turnover and retirement rates  the performance of the financial markets and interest rates 
if experience differs from the assumptions  the amounts we are obligated to contribute to the plans may increase 
in particular  the performance of the financial markets is difficult to predict  particularly in periods of high volatility in the equity markets 
if the financial markets perform lower than the assumptions  we may have to make larger contributions in the future than we would otherwise have to make and expenses related to defined benefit plans could increase 
similarly  changes in interest rates can impact our contribution requirements 
in a low interest rate environment  the likelihood of required contributions in the future increases 
if interest rates are lower in the future than we assume they will be  then we would probably be required to make larger contributions than we would otherwise have to make 
in addition  the decision of the supreme court of canada in monsanto canada inc v 
superintendent of financial services has caused companies in canada that sponsor defined benefit plans  including us  to review certain of our past activities that may have triggered partial wind ups of such plans to determine whether a distribution of plan surplus  if any  should have occurred at the time of any triggering event 
although the full impact of the decision remains unclear and we have not yet made any determination regarding our plans  if it is determined that a distribution of plan surplus should have occurred at the time of any triggering event  we may be required to make a distribution out of our plan assets  which may lead to an increase in the amount of future contributions that we are required to make 
if market conditions deteriorate or future results of operations are less than expected  an additional valuation allowance may be required for all or a portion of our deferred tax assets 
we currently have deferred tax assets  which may be used to reduce taxable income in the future 
we assess the realization of these deferred tax assets quarterly  and if we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of these assets will not be realized  an income tax valuation allowance is recorded 
if market conditions deteriorate or future results of operations are less than expected  future assessments may result in a determination that it is more likely than not that some or all of our net deferred tax assets are not realizable 
as a result  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance for all or a portion of our net deferred tax assets  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents our performance may be materially and adversely affected if our expectations regarding market demand for particular products prove to be wrong 
we expect that data communications traffic will grow at a faster rate than the growth expected for voice traffic and that the use of the internet will continue to increase 
we expect the growth of data traffic and the use of the internet will significantly impact traditional voice networks  both wireline and wireless 
we believe that this will create market discontinuities  which will make traditional voice network products and services less effective as they were not designed for data traffic 
we believe that these market discontinuities in turn will lead to the convergence of data and voice through upgrades of traditional voice networks to transport large volumes of data traffic or through the construction of new networks designed to transport both voice and data traffic 
either approach would require significant capital expenditures by service providers 
we also believe that such developments will give rise to the demand for ip optimized networking solutions  and third generation  or g  wireless networks 
we cannot be sure what the rate of this convergence of voice and data networks will be  due to the dynamic and rapidly evolving nature of the communications business  the technology involved and the availability of capital 
consequently  market discontinuities and the resulting demand for ip optimized networking solutions or g wireless networks may not continue 
alternatively  the pace of that development may be slower than currently anticipated 
on a regional basis  growth of our revenues from sales of our networking solutions in emerging markets  such as china and india  may be less than we anticipate if current customer orders are not indicative of future sales  strong growth in our umts technology does not occur  build out of the bsnl contract is slower than we expect  or those emerging markets experience slower growth or fewer deployments of voip and wireless data networks than we anticipate 
the market may also develop in an unforeseen direction 
certain events  including the commercial availability and actual implementation of new technologies  including g networks  or the evolution of other technologies  may occur  which would affect the extent or timing of anticipated market demand  or increase demand for products based on other technologies  or reduce the demand for ip optimized networking solutions or g wireless networks 
any such change in demand may reduce purchases of our networking solutions by our customers  require increased expenditures to develop and market different technologies  or provide market opportunities for our competitors 
our performance may also be materially and adversely affected by a lack of growth in the rate of data traffic  a reduction in the use of the internet or a reduction in the demand for ip optimized networking solutions or g wireless networks in the future  and slower than anticipated revenue growth from our network solutions such as wlan and carrier routing 
we also cannot be sure that the metro optical portion of our optical networks business will continue to represent as large of a percentage of our overall optical networks revenues as we expect  or that our current growth in carrier voip will continue  or that the continued decline in sales of our traditional circuit switching solutions will not decline more rapidly than we anticipate  any or all of which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we have made  and may continue to make  strategic acquisitions 
if we are not successful in operating or integrating these acquisitions  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
in the past  we acquired companies that we believed would enhance the expansion of our business and products 
we may make selective opportunistic acquisitions of companies or businesses with resources and product or service offerings capable of providing us with additional product and or market strengths 
acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties  including the industry may develop in a different direction than anticipated and the technologies we acquire may not prove to be those we need  the future valuations of acquired businesses may decrease from the market price we paid for these acquisitions  the revenues of acquired businesses may not offset increased operating expenses associated with these acquisitions  potential difficulties in completing in process research and development projects and delivering high quality products to our customers  
table of contents potential difficulties in integrating new products  software  businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner  our customers or customers of the acquired businesses may defer purchase decisions as they evaluate the impact of the acquisitions on our future product strategy  potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses  diversion of the attention of our senior management from the operation of our daily business  entering new markets in which we have limited experience and where competitors may have a stronger market presence  the potential adverse effect on our cash position as a result of all or a portion of an acquisition purchase price being paid in cash  potential issuance of common shares that would dilute our shareholders percentage ownership  and potential assumption of liabilities 
our inability to successfully operate and integrate newly acquired businesses appropriately  effectively and in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our ability to take advantage of further growth in demand for ip optimized network solutions and other advances in technology  as well as on our revenues  gross margins and expenses 
acquisitions are inherently risky  and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 
failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results 
we operate in highly dynamic and volatile industries characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and short product life cycles 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and short product life cycles 
our success depends  in substantial part  on the timely and successful introduction of high quality new products and upgrades  as well as cost reductions on current products to address the operational speed  bandwidth  efficiency and cost requirements of our customers 
our success will also depend on our ability to comply with emerging industry standards  to operate with products of other suppliers  to integrate  simplify and reduce the number of software programs used in our portfolio of products  to address emerging market trends  to provide our customers with new revenue generating opportunities and to compete with technological and product developments carried out by others 
the development of new  technologically advanced products  including ip optimized networking solutions  software products and g wireless networks  is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation  as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
investments in this development may result in our expenses growing at a faster rate than our revenues  particularly since the initial investment to bring a product to market may be high 
we may not be successful in targeting new market opportunities  in developing and commercializing new products in a timely manner or in achieving market acceptance for our new products 
the success of new or enhanced products  including ip optimized networking solutions and g wireless networks  depends on a number of other factors  including the timely introduction of those products  market acceptance of new technologies and industry standards  the quality and robustness of new or enhanced products  competing product offerings  the pricing and marketing of those products and the availability of funding for those networks 
products and technologies developed by our competitors may render our products obsolete 
hackers may attempt to disrupt or exploit our customers use of our technologies 
if we fail to respond in a timely and effective manner to unanticipated changes in one or more of the technologies affecting telecommunications and data networking or our new products or product enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance  our ability to compete effectively in our industry  and our sales  market share and customer relationships could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  unanticipated changes in market demand for products based on a specific technology  particularly lower than anticipated  or delays in  demand for ip optimized networking solutions  particularly long haul and metro optical networking solutions  or g wireless networks  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition if we fail to respond to those changes in a timely and effective manner 
we face significant competition and may not be able to maintain our market share and may suffer from competitive pricing practices 
we operate in a highly volatile industry that is characterized by industry rationalization and consolidation  vigorous competition for market share and rapid technological development 
competition is heightened in periods of slow overall market growth 
these factors could result in aggressive pricing practices and growing competition from smaller niche companies  established competitors  as well as well capitalized computer systems and communications companies  which  in turn  could separately or together with consolidation in the industry have a material adverse effect on our gross margins 

table of contents since some of the markets in which we compete are characterized by the potential for rapid growth and  in certain cases  low barriers to entry and rapid technological changes  smaller  specialized companies and start up ventures are now  or may in the future become  principal competitors 
we may also face competition from the resale of used telecommunications equipment  including our own on occasion  by failed  downsized or consolidated high technology enterprises and telecommunications service providers 
in addition  we face the risk that certain of our competitors may enter into additional business combinations  accelerate product development  or engage in aggressive price reductions or other competitive practices  which make them more powerful or aggressive competitors 
we expect that we will face additional competition from existing competitors and from a number of companies that have entered or may enter our existing and future markets 
in particular  we currently  and may in the future  face increased competition from low cost competitors such as huawei technologies co  ltd 
and zte corporation 
some of our current and potential competitors have greater marketing  technical and financial resources  including access to capital markets and or the ability to provide customer financing in connection with the sale of products 
many of our current and potential competitors have also established  or may in the future establish  relationships with our current and potential customers 
other competitive factors include the ability to provide new technologies and products  end to end networking solutions  and new product features  such as security  as well as conformance to industry standards 
increased competition could result in price reductions  negatively affecting our operating results  reducing profit margins and could potentially lead to a loss of market share 
we face certain barriers in our efforts to expand internationally 
we intend to continue to pursue international and emerging market growth opportunities 
in many international markets  long standing relationships between potential customers and their local suppliers and protective regulations  including local content requirements and type approvals  create barriers to entry 
in addition  pursuing international opportunities may require significant investments for an extended period before returns on such investments  if any  are realized and such investments may result in expenses growing at a faster rate than revenues 
furthermore  those projects and investments could be adversely affected by reversals or delays in the opening of foreign markets to new competitors  trade protection measures  exchange controls  currency fluctuations  investment policies  restrictions on repatriation of cash  nationalization of local industry  economic  social and political risks  taxation  interest rates  challenges in staffing and managing international opportunities  other factors  depending on the country involved  and acts of war or terrorism 
difficulties in foreign financial markets and economies and of foreign financial institutions  particularly in emerging markets  could adversely affect demand from customers in the affected countries 
an inability to maintain or expand our business in international and emerging markets could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
as an increasing proportion of our business may be denominated in currencies other than us dollars  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may have an adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our primary currency exposures 
table of contents are to canadian dollars  british pounds and the euro 
these exposures may change over time as we change the geographic mix of our global business and as our business practices evolve 
for instance  if we increase our presence in emerging markets  we may see an increase in our exposure to emerging market currencies  such as  for example  the indian rupee 
these currencies may be affected by internal factors and external developments in other countries 
also  our ability to enter into normal course derivative or hedging transactions in the future may be impacted by our current credit condition 
we cannot predict whether foreign exchange losses will be incurred in the future  and significant foreign exchange rate fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  or if we are subject to adverse judgments or settlements arising out of disputes regarding intellectual property rights  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
our industry is subject to uncertainty over adoption of industry standards and protection of intellectual property rights 
our success is dependent on our proprietary technology  for the protection of which we rely on patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws 
our business is global and the level of protection of our proprietary technology provided by those laws varies by jurisdiction 
our issued patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and our rights under issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages 
patents may not be issued from pending applications  and claims in patents issued in the future may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technology 
in addition  claims of intellectual property infringement or trade secret misappropriation may be asserted against us or our customers in connection with their use of our products and the outcome of any of those claims may be uncertain 
an unfavorable outcome in such a claim could require us to cease offering for sale the products that are the subject of such a claim  pay substantial monetary damages to a third party and or make ongoing royalty payments to a third party 
in addition  any defense of claims of intellectual property infringement or trade secret misappropriation may require extensive participation by senior management and or other key employees and may reduce their time and ability to focus on other aspects of our business 
a failure by us to react to changing industry standards  the lack of broadly accepted industry standards  successful claims of intellectual property infringement or other intellectual property claims against us or our customers  or a failure by us to protect our proprietary technology could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  if others infringe on our intellectual property rights  we may not be able to successfully contest such challenges 
rationalization and consolidation in the industry may lead to increased competition and harm our business 
the industry has experienced consolidation and rationalization and we expect this trend to continue 
there have been adverse changes in the public and private equity and debt markets for industry participants which have affected their ability to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures 
some operators have experienced financial difficulty and have  or may  file for bankruptcy protection or be acquired by other operators 
other operators may merge and we and one or more of our competitors may each supply products to the companies that have merged or will merge 
this rationalization and or consolidation could result in our dependence on a smaller number of customers  purchasing decision delays by the merged companies and or our playing a lesser role  or no longer playing a role  in the supply of communications products to the merged companies and downward pressure on pricing of our products 
this rationalization and or consolidation  including the acquisition by cingular wireless of at t wireless  could also cause increased competition among our customers and pressure on the pricing of their products and services  which could cause further financial difficulties for our customers 
a rationalization of industry participants could also increase the supply of used communications products for resale  resulting in increased competition and pressure on the pricing for our new products 
in addition  telecommunications equipment suppliers may enter into business combinations  or may be acquired by or sell a substantial portion of their assets to other competitors  resulting in accelerated product development  increased financial strength  or a broader base of customers  creating even more powerful or aggressive competitors 
we may also see rationalization among equipment component suppliers 
the business failures of operators  competitors or suppliers may cause uncertainty among investors and in the industry generally and harm our business 
changes in regulation of the internet and or other aspects of the industry may affect the manner in which we conduct our business and may materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
investment decisions of our customers could be affected by regulation of the internet or other aspects of the industry in any country where we operate 
we could also be materially and adversely affected by an increase in competition among equipment suppliers or by reduced capital spending by our customers  as a result of a change in the regulation of the industry 
if a jurisdiction in which we operate adopts measures which affect the regulation of the internet and or other aspects of the industry  we could experience both decreased demand for our products and increased costs of selling such products 
changes in laws or regulations governing the internet  internet commerce and or other aspects of the industry could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents in the us  on february   the fcc announced a decision in its triennial review proceeding of the agency s rules regarding unes 
the text of the fcc s order and reasons for the decision were released on august  the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the fcc s decision  judicial review of the decision  the adoption of interim rules  and the subsequent adoption of new unbundling rules with an effective date of march  is affecting  and may continue to affect  the decisions of certain of our us based service provider customers regarding investment in their telecommunications infrastructure 
these une rules and or material changes in other country specific telecommunications or other regulations may affect capital spending by certain of our service provider customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in europe  we are subject to new product content laws and product takeback and recycling requirements that will require full compliance by we expect that these laws will require us to incur additional compliance costs 
although compliance costs relating to environmental matters have not resulted in a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition in the past  they may result in a material adverse effect in the future 
our stock price has historically been volatile and further declines in the market price of our publicly traded securities may negatively impact our ability to make future acquisitions  raise capital  issue debt and retain employees 
our publicly traded securities have experienced  and may continue to experience  substantial price volatility  including considerable decreases  particularly as a result of variations between our actual or anticipated financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us  including our announcements related to the independent review  our management changes  the first restatement and the second restatement  the regulatory and criminal investigations  the class action litigations and other civil proceedings and related matters 
our credit quality  any equity or equity related offerings  operating results and prospects  restatements of previously issued financial statements  any exclusion of our publicly traded securities from any widely followed stock market indices  among other factors  will also affect the market price of our publicly traded securities 
the stock markets have experienced extreme price fluctuations that have affected the market price and trading volumes of many technology and telecommunications companies in particular  with potential consequential negative effects on the trading of securities of those companies 
a major decline in the capital markets generally  or an adjustment in the market price or trading volumes of our publicly traded securities  may negatively impact our ability to raise capital  issue debt  secure customer business  retain employees or make future acquisitions 
these factors  as well as general economic and geopolitical conditions  and continued negative events within the technology sector  may in turn have a material adverse effect on the market price of our publicly traded securities 
early settlement of our purchase contracts is currently not available to holders of purchase contracts 
acceleration of the settlement date on early settlement of our purchase contracts could contribute to volatility in the market price of our common shares 
owing to matters described above in developments in and nortel audit committee independent review  restatements  related matters with respect to the delayed filing of the reports  we are currently unable to permit holders of our prepaid forward purchase contracts to exercise certain early settlement rights and receive nortel networks corporation common shares in advance of the otherwise applicable august  settlement date 
these rights again will become exercisable upon the effectiveness of a registration statement or a post effective amendment to the shelf registration statement filed with the sec with respect to the common shares to be delivered that contains a related current prospectus 
under the terms of the purchase contract and unit agreement  which governs the purchase contracts  we have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to have in effect a registration statement covering the common shares to be delivered and to provide a prospectus in connection therewith 
on june   concurrent with the closing of a public offering of our common shares   equity units were sold  each initially evidencing ownership of a prepaid forward purchase contract  or purchase contract  entitling the holder to receive our common shares  and specified zero coupon us treasury strips 
as of march    purchase contracts were outstanding 
the aggregate number of our common shares issuable on the settlement date of the remaining purchase contracts will be between approximately million and million shares  subject to certain anti dilution adjustments which include adjustments for a possible consolidation of our common shares  depending on the applicable market value of nortel networks corporation common shares 
the settlement date for each purchase contract is august   subject to acceleration or early settlement in certain cases 

table of contents if we are involved in a merger  amalgamation  arrangement  consolidation or other reorganization event other than with or into nnl or certain other subsidiaries in which all of our common shares are exchanged for consideration of at least of the value of which consists of cash or cash equivalents  then a holder of purchase contracts may elect to accelerate and settle some or all of its purchase contracts  for our common shares 
the settlement date under each purchase contract will automatically accelerate upon the occurrence of specified events of bankruptcy  insolvency or reorganization with respect to us 
upon acceleration of the settlement date  holders will be entitled to receive  common shares per purchase contract regardless of the market price of our common shares at that time  subject to some anti dilution adjustments 
a holder of purchase contracts may also elect to accelerate the settlement date of some or all of its purchase contracts 
upon an early settlement  the holder will receive  common shares per purchase contract regardless of the market price of nortel networks corporation common shares at that time  subject to some anti dilution adjustments 
for more information on early settlement of our purchase contracts  see capital stock prepaid forward purchase contracts in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
an acceleration of the settlement date or early settlement of our purchase contracts could contribute to volatility in the market price of nortel networks corporation common shares 
industry concerns could continue and increase our exposure to our customers credit risk and the risk that our customers will not be able to fulfill their payment obligations to us under customer financing arrangements 
the competitive environment in which we operate has required us in the past to provide significant amounts of medium term and long term customer financing 
customer financing arrangements may include financing in connection with the sale of our products and services  funding for certain non product and service costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services  financing for working capital and equity financing 
while we have significantly reduced our customer financing exposure  we expect we may continue in the future to provide customer financing to customers in areas that are strategic to our core business activity 
we expect to continue to hold most current and future customer financing obligations for longer periods prior to any possible placement with third party lenders  due to  among other factors  recent economic uncertainty in various countries  adverse capital market conditions  our current credit condition  adverse changes in the credit quality of our customers and reduced demand for telecommunications financing in capital and bank markets 
in addition  risks generally associated with customer financing  including the risks associated with new technologies  new network construction  market demand and competition  customer business plan viability and funding risks  may require us to hold certain customer financing obligations over a longer term 
we may not be able to place any of our current or future customer financing obligations with third party lenders on acceptable terms 
certain customers have been experiencing financial difficulties and have failed to meet their financial obligations 
as a result  we have incurred charges for increased provisions related to certain trade and customer financing receivables 
if there are further increases in the failure of our customers to meet their customer financing and receivables obligations to us or if the assumptions underlying the amount of provisions we have taken with respect to customer financing and receivables obligations do not reflect actual future financial conditions and customer payment levels  we could incur losses in excess of our provisions  which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and operating results 
negative developments associated with our supply contracts and contract manufacturing agreements including in our optical networks segment as a result of using a sole supplier for a key component of our optical networks solutions may materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and supply relationships 
we have entered into supply contracts with customers to provide products and services  which in some cases involve new technologies currently being developed  or which we have not yet commercially deployed  or which require us to build networks 
some of these supply contracts contain delivery and installation timetables  performance criteria and other contractual obligations which  if not met  could result in our having to pay substantial penalties or liquidated damages and or the termination of the supply contract 
unexpected developments in these supply contracts could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  cash flows and relationships with our customers 
in particular  we currently rely on a sole supplier for key components of our optical networks solutions and our supply of such components used in our optical networks solutions could be materially adversely affected by adverse developments in the supply arrangement with that supplier 
in february  we agreed to waive for a period of time bookham s obligation to maintain a minimum cash balance under certain secured and unsecured notes and in march to adjust the prepayment provisions under these notes and to amend our supply agreement with bookham to provide certain product price increases and accelerated purchase orders and invoice payment terms 
the inability of such supplier to meet its contractual obligations under our supply arrangements and of us to make alternative arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  cash flows and relationships with our customers 

table of contents our ability to meet customer demand is  in part  dependent on us obtaining timely and adequate component parts and products from suppliers  contract manufacturers  and internal manufacturing capacity 
as part of the transformation of our supply chain from a vertically integrated manufacturing model to a virtually integrated model  we have outsourced  or are in the process of outsourcing  substantially all of our manufacturing capacity to contract manufacturers  including an agreement with flextronics announced on june  regarding the divestiture of certain of our manufacturing operations and related activities 
the transfer to flextronics of our optical design operations and related assets in ottawa  canada and monkstown  northern ireland was completed in the fourth quarter of in the first quarter of  we completed the portion of the transaction relating to our manufacturing activities in montreal  canada 
we and flextronics are currently discussing the timing of the closing of the balance of the remaining transaction in order to optimize the business transition between the companies 
as a result of these discussions  it is now expected that the balance of the transaction relating to the manufacturing operations in chateaudun  calgary and monkstown will close by the end of the first quarter of these transitions are subject to customary conditions and regulatory approvals 
upon the completion of the divestiture  a significant portion of our supply chain will be concentrated with flextronics 
we work closely with our suppliers and contract manufacturers to address quality issues and to meet increases in customer demand  when needed  and we also manage our internal manufacturing capacity  quality  and inventory levels as required 
however  we may encounter shortages of quality components and or products in the future 
in addition  our component suppliers and contract manufacturers have experienced  and may continue to experience  a consolidation in the industry and financial difficulties  both of which may result in fewer sources of components or products and greater exposure to the financial stability of our suppliers 
a reduction or interruption in component supply or external manufacturing capacity  a significant increase in the price of one or more components  or excessive inventory levels could materially and negatively affect our gross margins and our operating results and could materially damage customer relationships 
there is no assurance that we will be able to complete  on a timely basis or otherwise  the remaining portion of the transaction with flextronics  which could materially and negatively impact our cash flows and operating results and impede achievement of our strategic goal to improve our business efficiency and operating cost performance

any of these occurrences could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and loss of sales  which would harm our business and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our business may suffer if our strategic alliances are not successful 
we have entered into a number of strategic alliances with suppliers  developers and members in our industry to facilitate product compatibility  encourage adoption of industry standards or to offer complementary product or service offerings to meet customer needs 
in some cases  the companies with which we have strategic alliances also compete against us in some of our business areas 
if a member of a strategic alliance fails to perform its obligations  if the relationship fails to develop as expected or if the relationship is terminated  we could experience delays in product availability or impairment of our relationships with our customers
