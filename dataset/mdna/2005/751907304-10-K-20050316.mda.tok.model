item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis is intended to provide greater details of our results of operations and financial condition 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information under item selected financial data and item financial statements and supplementary data 
certain statements under this caption constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  and  as such  are based on current expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
the reader should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements for many reasons including those risks discussed under factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
forward looking statements may be identified by the use of forward looking words or phrases such as will  may  believe  expect  intend  anticipate  could  should  anticipate  plan  estimate  and potential  or other similar words 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  long lived assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are discussed under item financial statements and supplementary data note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  critical estimates inherent in these accounting policies are discussed in the following paragraphs 
revenue recognition 
revenue from product sales to direct customers is recognized upon shipment as we generally do not have any post shipment obligations or allow for any acceptance provisions 
we defer recognition of sales to distributors when we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of product returns due to insufficient historical product return information 
the revenue recorded is dependent upon estimates of expected customer returns and sales discounts 
revenue from licensing programs is recognized over the period we are required to provide services under the terms of the agreement 
revenue from research and development activities that are funded by customers are recognized as the services are performed 
page revenue from royalties is recognized upon the notification to us of shipment of product from our technology license partners to direct customers 
allowance for uncollectible accounts 
while we maintain a stringent credit approval process  significant judgments are made by management in assessing our customers ability to pay at the time of shipment 
despite this assessment  from time to time  customers are unable to meet their payment obligations 
we continue to monitor customers credit worthiness  and use judgment in establishing the estimated amounts of customer receivables which will ultimately not be collected 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of accounts receivable and future operating results 
inventory valuation 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or lack of marketability for the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
long lived assets 
we review the carrying values of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable 
under current standards  the assets must be carried at historical cost if the projected cash flows from their use will recover their carrying amounts on an undiscounted basis and without considering interest 
however  if projected cash flows are less than their carrying value  the long lived assets must be reduced to their estimated fair value 
considerable judgment is required to project such cash flows and  if required  estimate the fair value of the impaired long lived asset 
the estimated future cash flows are based upon  among other things  assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows 
there can be no assurance that future long lived asset impairments will not occur 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of december   and determined that no impairment existed at that date 
this assessment requires estimates of future revenue  operating results and cash flows  as well as estimates of critical valuation inputs such as discount rates  terminal values and similar data 
we continue to perform periodic and annual impairment analyses of goodwill resulting from acquisitions 
as a result of such impairment analyses  impairment charges may be recorded and may have a material adverse impact on our financial position and operating results 
additionally  we may make strategic business decisions in future periods which impact the fair value of goodwill  which could result in significant impairment charges 
there can be no assurance that future goodwill impairments will not occur 
page deferred income taxes 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements  and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
realization of the recorded deferred tax assets is dependent upon us generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate tax jurisdiction in future years to obtain benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences and from tax credit and operating loss carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided to the extent that management deems it more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income are changed 
results of operations overview since our inception  we have been engaged primarily in the research and development of ferroelectric technology and the design  development and commercialization of fram products and dram products 
revenue has been derived from the sale of our fram and dram products since we have also generated revenue under license and development agreements for specific applications of our technologies with a limited number of established semiconductor manufacturers 
accordingly  fluctuations in our revenue have resulted primarily from the timing of significant product orders  the timing of the signing of license and development agreements  and the achievement of related performance milestones 
our total revenue grew from to  and decreased from to total fram business revenue grew from to  and decreased from to fram revenue growth was primarily due to increased sales to core fram revenue customers as well as increased sales of new products 
the decrease in fram revenue from to was primarily due to a million decrease in license development fees from texas instruments that was partially offset by a increase in fram product revenue 
the increase in fram product revenue was primarily due to increased sales to core fram revenue customers 
fram product sales have increased proportionally as a source of revenue due to an expanding fram customer base  a deeper penetration of existing customers  an expanding line of fram products  and our participation in the utility meter replacement program at enel  which began in late since  we have generated average quarterly revenue of approximately million from our enel meter replacement program 
in  we expect enel to contribute million to million in revenue  down from million in based on our current estimates  first quarter enel shipments are anticipated to be down sharply but increase the second quarter  with the balance of enel shipments trending lower in the third and fourth quarters of we expect some residual shipments during the first quarter of we have been able to significantly increase revenue from other fram customers  also called core fram revenue  during each of the last three years  with product revenue totaling approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
core fram product revenue grew in  and in for  we anticipate that our core fram product revenue will grow between and over page since we built our cost structure to offset the roll off of sales to enel  our current operating plan anticipates that we will be profitable for full year we have publicly stated that it will take a few quarters to completely replace the historical revenue from enel  but with our core fram product business poised for additional growth in  we believe we are in a good position to make the transition as the enel program becomes a smaller portion of our fram revenue 
dram revenue increased from to economic conditions improved in the dimm market  which resulted in increased revenue 
this is the opposite of what happened in the dimm market in when mushkin s revenue decreased from to during this period  mushkin s business transitioned from generating revenue predominately from e commerce sources to a business with a substantial retail presence primarily through fry s electronics fry s and abs computer technologies abs 
currently  fry s and abs s sales represent approximately of mushkin s annual revenue 
also  during the latter part of  mushkin began focusing on lower volume  higher margin sales opportunities to improve its overall financial performance 
this focus reduced revenue but improved adjusted income exclusive of goodwill impairment charges in we anticipate mushkin s revenue to remain flat with that of during the first quarter of  we committed to a plan to sell substantially all of the remaining assets of ems 
the remaining assets consisted primarily of ems patent portfolio 
we completed the sale of ems patent portfolio on april   the proceeds of which were million 
due to a write down of the carrying value of the patent portfolio to its estimated fair value at march   there was no gain or loss recorded on the finalization of the sale 
our costs and expenses grew in  compared to a decline from to components of this spending are explained below 
our gross margin in was  compared with in  and in the improvement in gross margin in resulted primarily from a change in our product sales mix 
fram product sales grew in  while sales in our mushkin segment declined 
since fram products have a higher gross margin the shift in the product mix resulted in increased gross margin 
fram product gross margin during was compared with in  and in improvements in fram gross margin are attributable to product shrinks and other routine cost reduction activities 
in  fram gross margin improved as manufacturing yields improved  we shipped a more economical fram product into the enel metering program  and we realized cost reductions at our subcontract manufacturers 
mushkin product gross margin during was  compared with in  and in the mushkin margin improvement from to resulted primarily from higher average selling prices for mushkin products 
the mushkin margin deterioration from to resulted primarily from increased competition  which was detrimental to our prices and product margins 
page research and development expenses  including customer sponsored research and development  were basically flat from to these expenses  as a percentage of total sales were in  compared with in  and in we have held research and development expenses flat to bring our spending in line with our revenue 
sales  general and administrative expenses were of total revenue in  in  and in sales  general and administrative spending was flat from to  again to bring our spending in line with our revenue 
increased spending from million in  to million in  primarily relates to increased sales commissions  sales bonuses  management bonuses  and the costs implementing programs  processes  and external audit fees associated with the compliance requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley legislation 
we plan to introduce new products in including a new processor companion line and new application specific standard products assps 
our first assp was developed in partnership with two outside companies 
we have delivered samples and they have acknowledged that the product meets its specifications 
the three companies in partnership will market a complete system level solution including necessary ip 
we believe that end customers in the automotive and industrial markets can benefit from this offering 
in addition  we have begun development work on our next assp  which will be targeted for one of our strongest markets 
we benefit from a close working relationship with our strategic customers and may seek such partnerships for the development of other assps 
we have recently increased customer sampling of our one megabit fram memory product and continue to work on higher density fram products through our joint development program with texas instruments 
we may establish new foundry partners in the future to ensure broad support for our product plans 
to establish our proprietary fram process at a new foundry partner  we may acquire certain capital equipment 
during the first half of  a sustained downturn in dram market conditions resulted in lower than expected revenue and profitability of our mushkin segment 
because we believed the downturn was likely to continue and cause lower than expected sales and profitability for some time into the future  we believed it was appropriate to review the fair value of goodwill related to mushkin 
the result of our review was a charge of million for impairment of goodwill during for  we anticipate that our mushkin segment revenue will be approximately flat with revenue 
we are focusing our efforts on activities that may serve to improve the product margins on mushkin sales by increasing our efforts to sell higher end memory modules to the pc enthusiast  gamer and over clocking markets 
we expect margin pressures to remain in the retail segment of mushkin s business  which makes it difficult to predict the level of future margin improvements if any 
page results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to our total revenue was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  this was a year over year revenue growth rate of 
overall cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenue were approximately the same when compared to the prior year 
our costs and expenses were million during the year ended december   compared with million for the same period in the resulting income from continuing operations in was million  which compares to a loss from continuing operations of million in the million increase in operating results is due  in part  to an impairment of goodwill of million in and  in  holding spending levels for research and development  and sales  general and administrative expenses to a level consistent with profitability 
the combination of revenue growth and careful spending in resulted in the first profitable year since our inception 
our current plans anticipate that we will be profitable  on an annual basis in fram product sales have continued to contribute an increased dollar amount of gross margin for us on a year over year basis 
fram product gross margin contributions were million in and million in this is a result of improved gross margin percentages in compared to in  coupled with increased sales 
the increased sales are a result of the continued expansion of our fram customer base  deeper penetration to understand the current and future needs of our customers  expanding fram product portfolio  and our continued participation in the utility meter replacement program at enel 
we have communicated to investors that the revenue from the enel program is expected to ramp down in as the program nears completion 
enel product revenue in was million and in it was million 
we expect this program to contribute approximately to million to our fram revenue throughout we have been able to significantly increase revenue from other fram customers  our core fram product revenue totaled approximately million and million during and  respectively 
this is a year over year growth rate of 
product revenue at mushkin increased to million in from million in mushkin product gross margin for the year and decreased  and was and  respectively 
while mushkin experienced increasing revenue  the product margin percentages decreased and the resulting product margin contribution was million in compared to million in economic conditions in our dram market improved and resulted in increased revenue in  but increased competition was detrimental to our prices and product margins 
page in non product revenue  during  we experienced million in increased royalty revenue and million in increased license revenue  but these were offset by a million reduction in customer sponsored research and development revenue 
the increased royalty revenue are a result of increased royalty payments from a major fram licensee due to continued growth in its revenue stream 
the increase in the license and development fees resulted from a final installment on a license agreement 
customer sponsored research and development decreased because of a reduction in support provided to texas instruments 
we expect to see slight increases in royalty payments  and continued reductions in customer sponsored research and development revenue in combined research and development expenses for remained flat when compared to  but decreased to of revenue from of revenue in sales  general and administrative expenses for the year increased million year over year  but decreased from of revenue in to of revenue in the increase in results primarily from increased incentives relating to performance plans 
in  we plan to increase spending to fund additional research and development  increase spending in sales and marketing and reduce the percentage of revenue spent for general and administrative functions 
in  we recorded an impairment to goodwill of million relating to our dram segment  mushkin 
a sustained downturn in dram market conditions resulted in lower than expected actual and projected revenue and profitability of mushkin during the first half of because we believed the downturn would likely continue to cause lower than expected sales and profitability for some time into the future  we believed it was appropriate to review the fair value of goodwill related to mushkin as of june  the result of our review was a charge of million for impairment of goodwill in the quarter ended june  in calculating the impairment charge  the fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and market comparisons 
there can be no assurance that future goodwill impairments will not occur 
loss from discontinued operation 
during the three months ended march   we committed to a plan to sell substantially all of the remaining assets of our subsidiary  ems 
in accordance with sfas no 
 our consolidated financial statements have been recast to present this business as a discontinued operation 
the million operating loss in of the discontinued operation is primarily the result of an impairment of the carrying value of ems patent portfolio to its estimated fair value at march  the decrease from the operating loss of million in is primarily due to the reduction in activities at ems beginning in april page results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to revenue 
total revenue for was  a decrease million from fram product revenue for increased million to million  from increased fram product revenue is primarily attributable to increased shipments to core fram customers 
during  approximately of fram product revenue was attributable to the enel program 
additionally  we recorded revenue of approximately  related to a change in our estimate of returns from distributors during we historically recorded all shipments to distributors as deferred revenue until shipped to the end customer because we did not believe we had adequate historical data to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of future returns as required under statement of financial accounting standard no 
fas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
during the first quarter of  we concluded that we had sufficient shipment and return experience to allow for the recognition of revenue on shipments to certain distributors at the time of shipment  along with a reserve for estimated returns 
accordingly  during the first quarter of  we recognized an additional  in product sales revenue that would have been deferred prior to this change in estimate 
the impact on gross margins from this additional revenue was approximately  during product revenue at mushkin for was million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to decreases in mushkin product revenue is the result of focusing on lower volume  higher margin sales opportunities to improve its overall financial performance  reducing revenue but improving net income 
additionally  during the first quarter of  mushkin recognized  of revenue related to a change in the estimated amount of distributor product returns as discussed above 
the impact on gross margin from this additional revenue was approximately  in license and development fees for were million  as compared to million for the decline of million resulted from recognizing the remaining revenue related to our texas instruments fram license and development agreement during we recognized royalty revenue of million in in  million of royalty revenue was recognized 
this royalty income was primarily attributable to fram licensing agreements with existing licensees 
customer sponsored research and development revenue during is primarily attributable to our fram technology development program with texas instruments 
we recognized customer sponsored research and development revenue of million and million and  respectively 
the amount of customer sponsored research and development revenue recognized during a given quarter is dependent on the specific programs we are working on  the development stage of each program  the costs incurred during the quarter and the amount of work remaining to complete the program 
page gross margin as a percentage of product revenue during were and in gross margin associated with our fram products increased from in  to in fram gross margin improved as we improved manufacturing yields  shipped a more economical version of the product used in the enel metering program and realized cost reductions at our subcontract manufacturers 
gross margin as a percentage of product revenue at our mushkin subsidiary increased to in  as compared to in mushkin margin improvements are primarily the result of improved average selling prices for mushkin s products 
research and development expenses for million essentially stayed flat with a decrease of million 
this was due to reduced spending to bring our spending in line with our revenue during such period 
sales  general and administrative expenses for of million increased million from million in again  these were somewhat flat due to a focus on reduced spending to bring our spending in line with our revenue 
impairment of goodwill  as previously discussed  from a mid year review of goodwill associated with our mushkin subsidiary resulted in a charge of million for impairment of goodwill in related party interest expense increased million to million for  as compared to million in  primarily due to increases in interest expense related to the convertible debenture issued to infineon in march other interest expense increased million to million for  from million primarily due to interest expense related to convertible debentures issued to halifax fund  lp halifax and bramwell capital corporation bramwell in april and minimum interest charges related to our credit facility with wells fargo business credit  inc wells fargo 
loss from the discontinued operation increased to million in compared to million in this increase was primarily due to a million impairment charge related to intangible assets that occurred in liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased by million in to million 
cash flow provided by operations decreased by million to million as compared to  when we generated from operations 
cash generated by operating income  after non cash charges  which is net income adjusted by deprecation and amortization  the loss from discontinued operation  loss on abandonment of patents  provisions for inventory write offs  and impairment charges  was million  compared to million in the adjustments in included million of impairment charges and a million loss from discontinued operation 
during  we had no impairment charges and million in losses from the discontinued operation 
page additionally  working capital requirements increased million as compared to primarily due to an increase of million in accounts receivable and million in inventories 
these increases were the result of increases in our sales compared to during  we collected delinquent payments totaling million from a subcontract manufacturer on the enel program 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased on a year over year basis from million at the end of to million at the end of this increase is primarily attributable to increased purchases related to the increased sales in compared to as well as amounts accrued during relating to incentive compensation programs 
deferred revenue decreased million from million at the end of to million at the end of this decrease is primarily related to earning previously deferred revenue related to a fram technology license 
this deferred revenue is being amortized into revenue over the year remaining life of such technology license 
cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to million provided by investing activities in this change is primarily related to the discontinued operations which used million in during  million was generated from the discontinued operation  which included the impact of selling the remaining patents in for million 
in  the change in net cash used in financing activities was an increase of million 
this is primarily due to increased principal payments on our promissory notes of million in offset by increased cash received for the exercise of stock options of million 
we have million of convertible debentures that mature in march of we have several alternatives to fund this obligation  including the refinancing of these debentures 
it is possible that the stock price will reach a price that will result in the conversion of these debentures to common stock or we may undertake a private placement or public offering to raise funds sufficient to retire these obligations 
we have entered into a credit and security agreement with wells fargo business credit  inc to provide a secured million revolving line of credit 
the credit facility currently provides for interest at a floating rate equal to the prime lending rate plus per annum  minimum interest charges of  per year and a term of three years ending on march  security for the credit facility includes our non european accounts receivable and inventories 
the inclusion of any foreign receivable in the borrowing base requires foreign receivables insurance 
the current cost to us is approximately  per year 
we may use the credit facility for working capital requirements 
borrowing limits are subject to available collateral balances 
at december   the amount available under the revolving line of credit was million 
there were no borrowings on this facility at december  in the first half of  we borrowed and repaid  on this agreement 
we are exploring other credit arrangements that may provide a higher line of credit  or reduced costs for the availability of the credit facility 
page on april   we entered into an agreement to settle our long standing patent interference proceeding with national semiconductor corporation see item financial statements and supplementary data note of the notes of consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the settlement  beginning april we are required to pay national  annually through in the future  the primary source of operating cash flows is expected to product sales from our fram and dram product lines 
we had million in cash and cash equivalents at december  we believe we have sufficient resources to fund our operations through at least if this is not sufficient to meet our cash requirements  we may use the credit facility mentioned above or any other credit facility we may obtain 
in view of our expected future working capital requirements in connection with the design  manufacturing and sale of our fram products  and our projected expenditures  we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing 
there is no assurance  however  that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
any issuance of common or preferred stock to obtain additional funding would result in dilution of existing stockholders interests in us 
the inability to obtain additional financing when needed would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results and could adversely affect our ability to continue our business operations 
contractual commitments for more information on our contractual obligations on operating leases and contractual commitments  see item financial statements and supplementary data notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   our commitments under these obligations were as follows in thousands after total long term debt    operating leases purchase obligations   total     includes required principal and interest payments for outstanding debentures held by infineon  halifax and bramwell  the national settlement and minimum interest charges related to our revolving line of credit with wells fargo 
page our purchase obligations are amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders for goods and services with defined terms as to price  quantity  delivery and termination liability and are the result of purchase orders placed but not yet fulfilled by fujitsu  our semiconductor wafer supplier 
legal matters on april   the company and national semiconductor corporation national entered into an agreement to settle our long standing patent interference dispute  which began in as a patent interference proceeding that was declared in the united states patent and trademark office the patent office in regard to one of our issued united states patents 
the patent involved covers a basic ferroelectric memory cell design invention that we believe is of fundamental importance to our fram business in the united states 
under the terms of the settlement agreement we have abandoned four of the five claims in our existing patent  two of national s patent applications relating to the interference claims have been assigned to us and two others were retained by national 
national and ramtron have agreed to cross license any and all future patents that may be issued from the four applications at no additional cost to either company 
as consideration for the assigned patent applications and cross license provisions of the agreement  we will pay national million in equal annual installments of  through we have not recorded an impairment of the existing patents held for the technology in dispute since we believe  as a consequence of the assignments and cross license arrangements discussed previously  we are in a position now  insofar as our ability to use the technology in dispute is concerned  that is at least as favorable as our position prior to this resolution 
in addition  we believe the amounts capitalized related to these patents and licenses will be recovered through future cash proceeds 
the fifth remaining count of interference has been sent to a special master for a final ruling 
we believe our business would not be materially affected by an adverse judgment by the special master on the remaining count of interference 
the disposition of this matter  expected in  is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are party to legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business 
although the outcomes of any such legal actions cannot be predicted  our management believes that there is no pending legal proceeding against or involving us for which the outcome is likely to have a material adverse effect upon our financial position or results of operations 
page new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this standard addresses the accounting for transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for a our equity instruments or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of our equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
this standard also eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
the standard is effective for periods beginning after june  we are currently assessing our valuation options allowed in this standard 
even though we have not quantified the dollar amount of this new accounting standard at this time  the result will have a negative impact on our earnings starting with the accounting period beginning july  forward looking statements the following information should be read in conjunction with part i  item business  part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  and part ii
