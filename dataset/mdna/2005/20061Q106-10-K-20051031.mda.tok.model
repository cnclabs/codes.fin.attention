item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
we are a diversified independent energy marketer of electricity and natural gas to end user customers 
we provide retail electricity and natural gas to residential  commercial  industrial and institutional customers in nine states 
our principal operating subsidiary  commerce energy  inc  is licensed by the federal energy regulatory commission  or ferc  as a power marketer 
in addition to the states in which we currently operate  we are also licensed to supply retail electricity in new york  maryland  ohio and licensed to supply retail electricity and natural gas in virginia 
we were founded in as a retail electricity marketer in california and have grown to serve electricity and natural gas customers in nineteen utility markets in nine states 
growth has occurred by a combination of organic means and acquisitions 
in the past eighteen months we acquired skipping stone inc  or skipping stone  an energy consulting company  and purchased from american communications network  inc and certain of its subsidiaries  which we refer to collectively as acn  certain assets of acn s retail electric power and natural gas sales business 
as of july   we delivered electricity to approximately  customers in california  pennsylvania  michigan  new jersey and texas  and natural gas to approximately  customers in california  georgia  maryland  new york  ohio and pennsylvania 
the potential growth of this business depends upon a number of factors  including the degree of deregulation in each state  our ability to acquire new customers and retain existing customers and our ability to acquire energy for our customers at competitive prices and on favorable credit terms 
the electricity and natural gas we sell to our customers is purchased from third party suppliers under short term and long term contracts 
we do not own electricity generation facilities  natural gas producing properties or pipelines 
the electricity and natural gas we sell is generally metered and delivered to our customers by the local utilities 
the local utilities also provide billing and collection services for many of our customers on our behalf 
additionally  to facilitate load shaping and demand balancing for our customers  we buy and sell surplus electricity and natural gas from and to other market participants when necessary 
we utilize third party facilities for the storage of our natural gas 
acquisitions acn energy transaction on february   we entered into an asset purchase agreement with american communications network  inc  and certain of its subsidiaries  which we refer to as acn 
under the purchase agreement  we acquired certain assets of acn s retail electric power and natural gas sales business  and assumed specified liabilities 
we refer to this acquisition in this annual report as the acn energy transaction and the assets acquired in the acn energy transaction as the acn energy assets 
acn sold retail electric power in texas and pennsylvania and retail natural gas in california  ohio  georgia  new york  pennsylvania and maryland 
the assets of acn included equipment  gas inventory associated with utility and pipeline storage and transportation agreements and electricity supply  scheduling and capacity contracts  software and other infrastructure plus approximately  residential and small commercial customers 
the assets purchased and the operating results generated from the acn energy transaction have been included in our statement of operations as of february   in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement 
in addition  we entered into a sales agency agreement  pursuant to which we gained access to acn s network of independent sales representatives 
under the sales agency agreement  we pay acn a commission for customers acquired by their independent sales representatives and a per customer acquisition fee for each customer acquired through the sales agency agreement 
sales commissions are paid monthly in cash  while customer acquisition fees are paid by the issuance of our common stock to acn  based on the fair market value of the common stock when a customer acquisition fee is due 
the sales agency agreement has an initial term of one year  and is subject to annual renewal unless terminated by either party upon at least days prior written notice prior to the expiration of the initial term or any successive term 
should the parties extend the sales agency agreement for successive annual or other mutually agreeable period s then  for such periods the customer acquisition fees will be paid by the issuance of additional shares of our common stock to acn  based on the fair market value of the common stock when a customer acquisition fee is due 
the number of shares of our common stock that can be issued to acn 
table of contents under the purchase agreement and the sales agency agreement including any renewals thereof is capped at of the outstanding shares of common stock as of the closing date  or approximately  shares 
the aggregate purchase price was million in cash and  shares of the company common stock  valued at million 
the purchase was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and resulted in million of goodwill and million of intangibles  including the contingent equity and other intangible assets 
in addition  as part of the initial purchase price  we were required to fund million of collateralized letters of credit on the closing date to guarantee our performance to various third parties 
the common stock payment is contingent upon meeting certain sales requirements during the year following the acquisition date  and has been placed in an escrow account 
based on sales results to date  it appears that virtually none of the contingent consideration will be earned and goodwill will be reduced by substantially all of the million in february skipping stone inc on april   we acquired skipping stone inc which provides energy related consulting and technologies to utilities  electricity generators  natural gas pipelines  wholesale energy merchants  energy technology providers and financial institutions 
the aggregate purchase price for all of the outstanding skipping stone securities  which consisted of common stock and vested options  was million and the assumption of  of debt  subject to limited restrictions and true up provisions 
the purchase price was paid through the issuance of shares of our common stock valued at per share 
for the fiscal years ended july  and  skipping stone revenues after elimination of inter company transactions accounted for less than of total net revenue of commerce 
investments we have investments in two energy technology companies encorp inc formerly known as envenergy  inc  or encorp  a developer of software and hardware for energy and facility management that enables energy usage and cost information to be gathered and disseminated for the benefit of its customers  and power efficiency corporation  or pec  a company which markets its own brand of induction motor efficiency products that enhances motor performance and reduces energy consumption 
these two investments and our investment in turbocor bv  or turbocor which was sold in july  a manufacturer of energy efficient compressors for commercial heating  air conditioning  and refrigeration application  were previously held by summit energy ventures  llc  or summit  which we formed in july effective may   our equity interest and contractual relationship with summit were terminated and we acquired the direct ownership in the three portfolio companies previously held by summit 
in fiscal  we consolidated summit and its majority interest in pec into our financial results 
as a result of terminating our relationship with summit  we no longer consolidate summit and pec in our current fiscal year financial results because we retained a interest in pec 
as of july   our ownership interest had been reduced to as a result of equity linked financings by pec in which we did not participate 
we currently account for our investment in pec under the equity method of accounting  however  because we have no investment basis in pec  further losses are not being recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
on july   we sold our ownership interest in turbocor for million 
as of july   we continue to hold a interest in encorp 
market and regulatory we currently serve electricity and gas customers in nine states  operating within the jurisdictional territory of nineteen different local utilities 
among other things  tariff filings by local distribution companies  or ldcs  for changes in their allowed billing rate to their customers in the markets in which we operate  significantly impact the viability of our sales and marketing plans and our overall operating and financial results 
although regulatory requirements are determined at the individual state  and administered and monitored by the public utility commission  or puc  of each state  operating rules and rate filings for each utility are unique 
accordingly  we generally treat each utility distribution territory as a distinct market 

table of contents electricity currently  we actively market electricity in eleven ldc markets within the five states of california  pennsylvania  michigan  new jersey and texas 
on april   we began supplying customers in california with electricity as an electric service provider  or esp 
on september   the california public utility commission  or cpuc  issued a ruling suspending the right of direct access  which allowed electricity customers to buy their power from a supplier other than the electric utilities 
this suspension  although permitting us to keep current direct access customers and to solicit direct access customers served by other esps  prohibits us from soliciting new non direct access customers for an indefinite period of time 
currently  several important issues are under review by the cpuc  including a resource adequacy requirement and a renewable portfolio standard 
additional costs to serve customers in california are anticipated from these proceedings  however  the cpuc decisions will determine the distribution of costs across all load serving entities 
we cannot currently estimate the impact that these issues and anticipated additional costs may have on our future financial results 
there are no current rate cases or filings in the states of pennsylvania  michigan  new jersey or texas that are anticipated to impact our financial results 
natural gas currently  we actively market natural gas in eight ldc markets within the six states of california  georgia  maryland  new york  ohio and pennsylvania 
due to recent and significant increases in the price of natural gas  a number of ldcs have filed or communicated expectations of filing for approval of rate increases to their customers 
although the impact of these filings cannot currently be estimated  they are not anticipated to adversely impact our financial results 
we provide natural gas service to residential and small commercial customers in the dominion east ohio  or deo  and the columbia gas of ohio service areas 
in december  deo notified the public utilities commission of ohio  or puco  of its desire to exit the commodity market 
its stated goal is to become a distribution only company by the end of nearly of deo s customers currently participate in customer choice whereby they are already receiving the commodity portion of the service from a provider other than deo 
in april  deo filed with the puco to embark upon its plan 
the ultimate outcome of this filing is unknown  however  it is not anticipated to adversely impact our financial results 
we provide natural gas service to residential and small commercial consumers in the philadelphia electric company service area in pennsylvania 
in may  the pennsylvania public utility commission  or puc  undertook an evaluation of the competitiveness of natural gas supply services in the state 
if the puc determines the market is not sufficiently competitive  further actions will be considered 
we are the only natural gas provider to residential customers in this market 
the potential impact of this evaluation to our operations is unknown at this time 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and operating results are based on our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions 
in preparing our financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances  we apply our accounting policies as disclosed in our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies discussed below are those that we consider to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our ability to judge the effect of inherently uncertain matters on our financial results 
for all of these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities we purchase substantially all of our power and natural gas under forward physical delivery contracts for supply to our retail customers 

table of contents these forward physical delivery contracts are defined as commodity derivative contracts under statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
using the exemption available for qualifying contracts under sfas no 
 we apply the normal purchase and normal sale accounting treatment to a majority of our forward physical delivery contracts 
accordingly  we record revenue generated from customer sales as energy is delivered to our retail customers and the related energy cost under our forward physical delivery contracts is recorded as direct energy costs when received from our suppliers 
as a result of a sale on january  of two significant electricity forward physical delivery contracts on a net cash settlement basis back to the original supplier  the normal purchase and normal sale exemption is no longer available for our pennsylvania market pjm iso 
accordingly  we designate forward physical delivery contracts entered into for our pennsylvania electricity market pjm iso  and certain other forward fixed price purchases and financial derivatives as cash flow hedges  whereby mark to market accounting gains or losses are deferred and reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss until the time of physical delivery and the fair value of the contracts is recorded as a current or long term derivative asset or liability 
subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative assets and liabilities are recorded on a net basis in other comprehensive income loss and subsequently reclassified as direct energy cost in our consolidated statement of operations as the power is delivered 
to the extent that the hedges are not effective  the ineffective portion of the changes in fair market value is recorded currently in direct energy costs 
we intend to continue to use financial derivative instruments such as swaps  options and futures as an effective way of assisting in managing our price risk in energy supply procurement 
additionally  we expect to utilize cash flow hedge accounting  where appropriate 
we also utilize other financial derivatives  primarily swaps  options and futures to hedge our commodity price risks 
certain derivative instruments  which are designated as economic hedges or as speculative  do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and require current period mark to market accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 with fair market value being used to determine the related income or expense that is recorded each quarter in the statement of operations 
as a result  the changes in fair value of derivatives that do not meet the requirements of normal purchase and normal sale accounting treatment or cash flow hedge accounting are recorded in operating income loss and as a current or long term derivative asset or liability 
the subsequent changes in the fair value of these contracts could result in operating income loss volatility as the fair value of the changes are recorded on a net basis in direct energy costs in our consolidated statement of operations for each period 
we determined that our documentation during fiscal was inadequate for the contracts that were designated for cash flow hedge accounting treatment pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 resulting in current period mark to market accounting for all of our electricity forward physical contracts and financial derivatives designated as cash flow hedges in fiscal utility and independent system operator included in direct energy costs  along with the cost of energy that we purchase  are scheduling costs  independent system operator  or iso  fees  interstate pipeline costs and utility service charges 
the actual charges and certain energy costs are not finalized until subsequent settlement processes are performed for all distribution system participants 
prior to the completion of settlements which may take from one to several months  we estimate these costs based on historical trends and preliminary settlement information 
the historical trends and preliminary information may differ from actual information resulting in the need to adjust previously estimated costs 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from non payment of customer billings 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
net revenue and unbilled receivables our customers are billed monthly at various dates throughout the month 
unbilled receivables represent the estimated sale amount for power delivered to a customer at the end of a reporting period  but not yet billed 
unbilled receivables from sales are estimated based upon the amount of power delivered  but not yet billed  multiplied by the average sales price per unit to our customers 

table of contents inventory inventory consist of natural gas in storage as required by state regulatory bodies and contracted obligations under customer choice programs 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
legal matters from time to time  we may be involved in litigation matters 
we regularly evaluate our exposure to threatened or pending litigation and other business contingencies and accrue for estimated losses on such matters in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
as additional information about current or future litigation or other contingencies becomes available  management will assess whether such information warrants the recording of additional expense relating to our contingencies 
such additional expense could potentially have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position 
results of operations the following table summarizes the results of our operations for fiscal  and dollars in thousands fiscal year ended july  dollars revenue dollars revenue dollars revenue retail electricity sales natural gas sales excess energy sales green power credits net revenue direct energy costs gross profit selling and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses reorganization and initial public listing expenses income loss from operations fiscal year ended july  compared to fiscal year ended july  operating results for the year ended july  reflect a loss from operations of million compared to a loss of million for the year ended july  the principal reasons for the decrease in the loss from operations were a million increase in gross profit and a million reduction in reorganization and initial public listing expenses  partly offset by a million increase in general and administrative expenses 
higher general and administrative expenses were due primarily to added overhead resulting from the addition of natural gas and electric customers in six new markets as a result of our acquisition of assets from subsidiaries of american communications network  inc the acn energy transaction and higher severance cost related to former executive officers 
gross profit for fiscal increased to million  a increase compared to gross profit of million in fiscal higher gross profit reflects million from the six months of contribution from the acn energy assets and a second quarter gain of million from repositioning of the customer portfolio and the sale of electricity supply contracts in pennsylvania 
these gains were partly reduced by lower gross profit on sales in our traditional electricity markets in california  michigan and pennsylvania 
our net loss for fiscal was million  compared to a net loss of million in fiscal in addition to the above reasons  in fiscal we recorded a gain of million on the sale of our turbocor investment compared to losses in of million for impairment of investments previously held by summit and million for termination of our equity ownership in summit 

table of contents net revenue the following table summarizes net revenues for fiscal and dollars in thousands fiscal year ended july  dollars revenue dollars revenue retail electricity sales california pennsylvania new jersey michigan all other states  principally texas total retail electricity sales natural gas sales california ohio georgia all other states total natural gas sales net revenue net revenues for fiscal were million  a increase compared to net revenues of million in fiscal the increase in net revenue was primarily attributable to the addition of the acn energy assets and higher wholesale market prices for electricity 
these net revenue increases were partly offset by the impact of lower sales volumes in the company s traditional electricity markets in california  pennsylvania and michigan 
retail electricity sales for fiscal were million  an increase from fiscal in fiscal  we sold  million kwh  at an average retail price per kwh of  as compared to  million kwh sold at an average retail price per kwh of in fiscal california sales were million kwh at an average price per kwh of in fiscal  as compared to million kwh sold at an average price per kwh of in fiscal pennsylvania and new jersey sales were  million kwh at an average price per kwh of in fiscal  as compared to  million kwh at an average price of in fiscal sales in michigan decreased to million kwh at an average price per kwh of in fiscal  as compared to million kwh at an average price per kwh of in fiscal sales volumes in pennsylvania declined reflecting the return  beginning in april  of certain residential and small commercial customers to the incumbent utility based upon competitive factors 
similarly  lower sales volumes in michigan reflects the impact of regulatory changes causing nearly all of michigan s large industrial customers to return to the incumbent utility during the year 
sales in texas  resulting from the acquisition of the acn energy assets  were million in fiscal we acquired our natural gas business in six markets in february in fiscal  natural gas sales were million 
we sold approximately million dekatherms  or dth  in fiscal at an average price of per dth 
excess energy sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal reflecting higher demand and supply balancing activities in our california and pennsylvania markets resulting primarily from increased volatility in the market price of electricity 
additionally  excess energy sales include million realized on the sale of pennsylvania electricity supply contracts back to the original supplier 
we had approximately  retail electricity customers at july   a decrease of from  at july  this customer attrition in our retail electricity markets largely reflects the impact of increased sales prices to our customers resulting from higher wholesale electricity supply and transmission costs without corresponding price increases from incumbent utilities due to the lack of market responsive ratemaking and a lagging regulatory approval process 
the majority of the decline in our retail electricity customers occurred in our pennsylvania market whereby  beginning in april  we returned approximately 
table of contents  residential and small commercial customers to the incumbent utility since we could no longer offer competitive service 
additionally  the decline in our customer base is partly attributed to our focus on increasing our commercial and industrial base 
we also had approximately  natural gas customers at july  direct energy costs direct energy costs  which are recognized concurrently with related energy sales  include the commodity cost of natural gas and electricity  electricity transmission costs from the isos  transportation costs from ldcs and pipelines  other fees and costs incurred from various energy related service providers and energy related taxes that cannot be passed directly through to the customer 
direct energy costs for fiscal totaled million and million for electricity and natural gas  respectively 
electricity cost increased from fiscal due primarily to the addition of million of supply cost for the electric customers acquired in the acn energy transaction 
higher direct energy costs for electricity due to increases in average cost to per kwh for fiscal  as compared to per kwh for fiscal  were offset by lower kwh purchases in fiscal compared to fiscal direct energy costs for natural gas for fiscal averaged per dth 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses were million for fiscal  a decrease of million  from million for fiscal lower selling and marketing expenses for fiscal primarily resulted from reductions in the cost of our internal marketing efforts partly offset by the additional sales and marketing costs related to the acn energy transaction 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal  an increase of million  from million for fiscal the increase in fiscal reflects million of added costs related to the acquired operations resulting from the acquisition of assets in the acn energy transaction and million in increased severance costs related to the settlement of the employment contracts of the former executive officers 
these higher costs were partly offset by a decrease of million in costs related to our ownership of summit and investment in pec 
reorganization and initial public listing expenses we incurred costs of million in fiscal related to our reorganization into a delaware holding company structure and the initial public listing of our common stock on the american stock exchange 
we incurred no such expenses in fiscal recovery of provision for impairment on investments in fiscal  we recorded a provision of million for impairment on investments previously held by summit 
such provision included million related to our remaining investment in turbocor and resulted in no investment basis in turbocor as july  in july  we sold our nominal stock holdings in its entirety for million in cash 
initial formation litigation expenses in fiscal  we incurred million of initial formation litigation costs related to commonwealth energy corporation s formation  the same amount as fiscal year initial formation litigation expenses include legal and litigation costs associated with the initial capital raising 
loss on termination of summit in fiscal  we recorded a loss on the termination of our interest in summit of million 
the loss included contractually owed management fees and transaction costs of million and a reduction of our ownership interest from to in pec to reflect settlement and the termination of our interest in summit 
we incurred no such expenses in fiscal 
table of contents minority interest share of loss minority interest share of loss represents that portion of pec s post consolidation losses that were allocated to the non summit investors based on their aggregate minority ownership interest in pec 
for fiscal  the minority interest share of loss was million 
we incurred no such losses in fiscal interest income  net our interest income  net was million for fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal the increase in interest income was primarily due to higher market yields realized on short term investments 
income before provisions for income taxes the loss before provision for income taxes was million for fiscal  a decrease of million  compared to a loss of million for fiscal the company currently has no provision for income taxes for fiscal compared to a benefit from income taxes of million for fiscal our effective income tax rate was for fiscal  compared to an effective income tax benefit rate of for fiscal the fiscal decrease in our effective income tax rate was attributable to an increase in the valuation allowance 
year ended july  compared to year ended july  net revenue for fiscal was million  an increase of million  or  from million in fiscal gross profit of million for fiscal declined million  or  from million in fiscal our operating results for the year ended july  included a loss from operations of million compared to income from operations of million for the year ended july  the operating loss in fiscal was primarily due to the higher cost of electricity per kwh 
the higher cost of electricity per kwh was primarily caused by the substantial increase in natural gas prices  which is a significant influencing factor on electricity prices in the wholesale markets nationally 
the higher costs related to serving our customers led to some customer attrition in california and pennsylvania in the latter part of the fiscal year 
also  in california  demand was less than forecast and as a result  we sold our excess energy at lower prices then we paid  reducing gross margins 
net loss for fiscal was million compared to net income of million in fiscal in addition  to the above reasons  in fiscal  we recorded a provision for impairment on investments of million for investments previously held by summit and  subsequently  a loss of million on the termination of the summit venture 
net revenue the increase of million in net revenue for fiscal  compared to the fiscal  resulted primarily from increased energy sales of million in pennsylvania and new jersey  and million in michigan 
these increases were due to increasing the customer sales base in these markets in fiscal and were partly offset by a decrease of million in energy sales in california  primarily due to a decline in the price per kwh in fiscal and the absence of green power credits in fiscal sales in pennsylvania and new jersey increased to  million kwh at an average price per kwh of in the fiscal  as compared to million kwh at an average price per kwh of in the fiscal reflecting the acquisition towards the end of fiscal of commercial customers with higher average rates and a reduced number of residential customers in fiscal sales in michigan increased to million kwh at an average price per kwh of in fiscal  as compared to million kwh at an average price per kwh of in fiscal reflecting increased customer acquisition efforts by our sales operations 
california sales were million kwh at an average price per kwh of in fiscal  as compared to  million kwh sold at an average price per kwh of in fiscal the million green power credits in fiscal represents the recovery from the reinstatement by the state of california public purpose program to provide incentives to suppliers of renewable power to reduce the 
table of contents cost of such power to certain customers 
this green power credit program was discontinued for periods after march we had approximately  retail customers at july   a decrease from  at july  customer attrition was and in california and pennsylvania  respectively  reflecting focus on increasing commercial and industrial customer base  which have higher average electricity usage and generally higher rates  while reducing the number of residential customers 
the decline in customer base also is partially attributed to increased energy costs to serve our customers 
direct energy costs our direct energy costs increased to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  from million for fiscal the significant increase in direct energy costs per retail kwh delivered occurred in all states  primarily due to the increase of natural gas costs which is a significant factor influencing electricity costs in our markets 
the increase in our customer base was also a contributing factor to the absolute increase in direct energy costs 
in pennsylvania and new jersey  the average cost per kwh was for the fiscal year ended july   as compared to an average cost per kwh of for fiscal in michigan  the average cost per kwh was for the fiscal year ended july   as compared to an average cost per kwh of for fiscal in california  the average cost per kwh was for fiscal  as compared to an average cost per kwh of for fiscal selling and marketing expenses our selling and marketing expenses were million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or  from million for fiscal selling and marketing expenses for fiscal primarily represent marketing efforts associated with our expansion into the new jersey market  including radio and newspaper advertising and further market research conducted on certain states under consideration for future expansion 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  from million for fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due from the consolidation of pec of million through the third quarter of fiscal  severance payments totaling million related to the settlement of the employment agreements with two former executive officers  stock based compensation expense of million for fully vested options that were granted in fiscal with an exercise price below fair market value on the grant date  relocation expenses of million for our new executive officers  additional bad debt expense of million and insurance costs of million 
reorganization and initial public listing expenses we incurred million in fiscal of costs related to our reorganization into a delaware holding company structure and the initial public listing of our common stock on the american stock exchange 
management believes it is appropriate to classify these costs as separately identified operating expenses 
these general and administrative expenses incurred in connection with the reorganization included legal of million  insurance of million  consulting of million  printing and reproduction fees of million and accounting and auditing of million 
initial formation litigation expenses in fiscal  we incurred million of initial formation litigation costs related to our formation compared to million of such costs incurred during fiscal initial formation litigation expenses include legal and litigation costs associated with the initial capital raising efforts by former employees and the legal complications arising from those matters 
the fiscal expense includes million which was accrued in connection with a lawsuit filed by several former employees  who were employed during and  exclusively to raise capital for us from outside investors 
in fiscal  we settled this litigation and the settlement resulted in a reduction of the accrual of million after final settlement payments were made to the plaintiffs 

table of contents provision for impairment on investments in fiscal  we recorded a provision for impairment of million on investments previously held by summit to reflect our percentage ownership in the net equity reflected in the financial statements of each investment entity 
the impairments reflected continuing operating losses  liquidity and future funding uncertainties on all three investments 
for encorp  we recorded a million provision for impairment with a remaining investment basis of million in our consolidated financial statements 
for turbocor  we recorded a million provision for impairment with no remaining investment basis in our consolidated financial statements 
for pec  we recorded a million provision for impairment with no remaining investment basis after the provision for termination below to reflect our reduced investment ownership percentage in pec shares 
loss on termination of our interest in summit in fiscal  we recorded a loss on the termination of our interest in summit of million 
the loss included contractually owed management fees and transaction costs of million and a reduction of our ownership interest from to in pec to reflect settlement and the termination of our interest in summit 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
loss on equity investments in fiscal  we incurred a million aggregate loss on equity investments which reflected our proportionate recognition of losses under the equity method of accounting relating to pec and  to a lesser extent  turbocor 
by the end of fiscal  summit acquired a majority ownership position in pec  thereby causing consolidation of pec into our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended july  the consolidation continued through april   when the termination agreement with summit reduced our ownership percentage to 
by the end of our fiscal year ended july   summit s ownership interest in turbocor had been reduced to a level at which we no longer exercised significant influence 
as a result  commencing in fiscal  we accounted for turbocor under the cost method of accounting 
minority interest share of loss minority interest share of loss represents that portion of pec s post consolidation losses that were allocated to the non summit investors based on their aggregate minority ownership interest in pec 
for the fiscal year ended july  and  the minority interest share of loss was million and million  respectively 
interest income  net our interest income  net was million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or  from million in fiscal the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower market yields realized on short term investments 
provision for benefit from income taxes the benefit from income taxes was million for fiscal  compared to the provision for income taxes of million for fiscal in fiscal  the benefit from income taxes was comprised of a write down of deferred tax assets for million offset by operating loss carrybacks of million 
our effective income tax benefit rate was for fiscal  compared to an effective income tax rate of for fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources as of july   cash and cash equivalents decreased to million compared with million at july  this decrease of million was partly offset by increases of million at july  in restricted cash  cash equivalents and deposits 
restricted cash and cash equivalents at july  was million  compared to million at july   while cash deposits totaled million at july  
table of contents  compared to million at july  these changes reflect the impact of cash used in the acn energy transaction and increased energy supplier credit requirements 
our principal sources of liquidity to fund ongoing operations were cash provided by operations and existing cash and cash equivalents 
cash used in operating activities for fiscal was million  compared to cash provided by operations of million in the prior year 
for fiscal  cash usage was caused primarily by decreases in accounts payable of million 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal cash used in investments was primarily for the purchase of assets in the acn energy transaction in fiscal cash used in financing activities during fiscal was million  as compared to cash provided by financing activities of million during fiscal in fiscal  restricted cash and cash equivalents increased by million which was primarily due to increased energy supplier credit requirements in new jersey and pennsylvania 
we do not have open lines of credit for direct unsecured borrowings or letters of credit 
credit terms from our suppliers often require us to post collateral against our energy purchases and against our mark to market exposure with certain of our suppliers 
we currently finance these collateral obligations with our available cash 
as of july   we had million in restricted cash and cash equivalents to secure letters of credit required by our suppliers and million in deposits pledged as collateral to our energy suppliers in connection with energy purchase agreements 
based upon our current plans  level of operations and business conditions  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements and working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not be required to seek other financing in the future or that such financing  if required  will be available on terms satisfactory to us 
planned capital expenditures our planned capital expenditures for the fiscal are approximately million and are largely comprised of information system upgrades 
these expenditures are expected to be pro rata throughout the year and funded out of working capital 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements and have no transactions involving unconsolidated  limited purpose entities 
contractual obligations as of july   we have commitments of million for electricity purchase contracts in the normal course of business 
these contracts are with various suppliers and extend through december in addition  at july   we have commitments of million for natural gas purchase contracts  which are primarily transportation and capacity contracts  through october our most significant operating lease pertains to our corporate office facilities 
all of our other operating leases pertain to various equipment and technology 
certain of these operating leases are non cancelable and contain clauses that pass through increases in building operating expenses 
we incurred aggregate rent expense under operating leases of million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 

table of contents the following table shows our contractual commitments as of july  dollars in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years electricity gas purchase contracts operating leases total seasonal influences demand for electricity and natural gas are continually influenced by both seasonal and abnormal weather patterns 
to the extent that one or more of our markets experiences a period of unexpected weather  we may be required to either attempt to procure additional energy to service our customers or to sell surplus energy in the open market 
factors that may affect future results if competitive restructuring of the retail energy market is delayed or does not result in viable competitive market rules  our business will be adversely affected 
the federal energy regulatory commission  or ferc  has maintained a strong commitment to the deregulation of wholesale electricity markets 
the new provisions of epa should serve to further enhance the reliability of the electric transmission grid which our electric marketing operations depend on for delivery of power to our customers 
this movement at the federal level has in part helped spur deregulation measures in the states at the retail level 
twenty three states and the district of columbia have either enacted enabling legislation or issued a regulatory order to implement retail access 
in of these states  retail access is either currently available to some or all customers  or will soon be available 
however  in many of these markets the market rules adopted have not resulted in energy service providers being able to compete successfully with the local utilities and customer switching rates have been low 
our business model depends on other favorable markets opening under viable competitive rules in a timely manner 
in any particular market  there are a number of rules that will ultimately determine the attractiveness of any market 
markets that we enter may have both favorable and unfavorable rules 
if the trend towards competitive restructuring of retail energy markets does not continue or is delayed or reversed  our business prospects and financial condition could be materially adversely impaired 
retail energy market restructuring has been and will continue to be a complicated regulatory process  with competing interests advanced not only by relevant state and federal utility regulators  but also by state legislators  federal legislators  local utilities  consumer advocacy groups and other market participants 
as a result  the extent to which there are legitimate competitive opportunities for alternative energy suppliers in a given jurisdiction may vary widely and we cannot be assured that regulatory structures will offer us competitive opportunities to sell energy to consumers on a profitable basis 
the regulatory process could be negatively impacted by a number of factors  including interruptions of service and significant or rapid price increases 
the legislative and regulatory processes in some states take prolonged periods of time 
in a number of jurisdictions  it may be many years from the date legislation is enacted until the retail markets are truly open for competition 
other aspects of epa  such as the repeal of puhca and replacing it with puhca  also may impact our business to the extent ferc does not continue the sec s precedent of not regulating electric and gas marketers under puhca 
a rulemaking implementing puhca is currently pending before ferc 
if marketers and their parent companies and affiliates are to be regulated under puhca  ferc may have access to their books and records and has oversight of their affiliate transactions 
various parties participating in ferc rulemaking have urged ferc not to so regulate marketers and other entities that do not own or operate gas or electric facilities 
in addition  although most retail energy market restructuring has been conducted at the state and local levels  bills have been proposed in congress in the past that would preempt state law concerning the restructuring of the retail energy markets 
although none of these initiatives has been successful  we cannot 
table of contents assure stockholders that federal legislation will not be passed in the future that could materially adversely affect our business 
we face many uncertainties that may cause substantial operating losses and we cannot assure stockholders that we can achieve and maintain profitability 
we intend to increase our operating expenses to develop and expand our business  including brand development  marketing and other promotional activities and the continued development of our billing  customer care and power procurement infrastructure 
our ability to operate profitably will depend on  among other things our ability to attract and to retain a critical mass of customers at a reasonable cost  our ability to continue to develop and maintain internal corporate organization and systems  the continued competitive restructuring of retail energy markets with viable competitive market rules  our ability to effectively manage our energy procurement and shaping requirements  and to sell our energy at a sufficient profit margin  and our ability to obtain and retain necessary credit necessary to support future growth and profitability 
we may have difficulty obtaining a sufficient number of customers 
we anticipate that we will incur significant costs as we enter new markets and pursue customers by utilizing a variety of marketing methods 
in order for us to recover these expenses  we must attract and retain a large number of customers to our service 
we may experience difficulty attracting customers because many customers may be reluctant to switch to a new supplier for a commodity as critical to their well being as electricity and natural gas 
a major focus of our marketing efforts will be to convince customers that we are a reliable provider with sufficient resources to meet our commitments 
if our marketing strategy is not successful  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we depend upon internally developed  and  in the future will rely on vendor developed  systems and processes to provide several critical functions for our business  and the loss of these functions could materially adversely impact our business 
we have developed our own systems and processes to operate our back office functions  including customer enrollment  metering  forecasting  settlement and billing 
we are currently in the process of replacing a number of our internally developed legacy software systems with vendor developed systems 
problems that arise with the performance of such back office functions could result in increased expenditures  delays in the launch of our commercial operations into new markets  or unfavorable customer experiences that could materially adversely affect our business strategy 
any interruption of these services could also be disruptive to our business 
as we transition from our own systems to new vendor developed systems  we may incur duplicative expenses for a period of time and we may experience installation and integration issues with the new systems or delays in the implementation of the new systems 
if we experience some or all of these new system implementation risks  we may not be able to establish a sufficient operating history for sarbanes oxley attestation requirements  which we expect we must meet by no later than fiscal year ending july  substantial fluctuations in electricity and natural gas prices or the cost of transmitting and distributing electricity and natural gas could have a material adverse affect on us 
to provide electricity and natural gas to our customers  we must  from time to time  purchase the energy commodity in the short term or spot wholesale energy markets  which can be highly volatile 
in particular  the wholesale electricity market can experience large price fluctuations during peak load periods 
furthermore  to the extent that we enter into contracts with customers that require us to provide electricity and natural gas at a fixed price over an extended period of time  and to the extent that we have not purchased the commodity to cover those commitments  we may incur losses caused by rising wholesale prices 
periods of rising prices may 
table of contents reduce our ability to compete with local utilities because their regulated rates may not immediately increase to reflect these increased costs 
energy service providers like us take on the risk of purchasing power for an uncertain load and if the load does not materialize as forecast  it leaves us in a long position that would be resold into the wholesale electricity and natural gas market 
sales of this surplus electricity could be at prices below our cost 
long positions of natural gas must be stored in inventory and are subject to the lower of cost or market valuations that can produce unrealized losses 
conversely  if unanticipated load appears that may result in an insufficient supply of electricity or natural gas  we would need to purchase the additional supply 
these purchases could be at prices that are higher than our sales price to our customers 
either situation could create losses for us if we are exposed to the price volatility of the wholesale spot markets 
any of these contingencies could substantially increase our costs of operation 
such factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we are dependent on local utilities for distribution of electricity and natural gas to our customers over their distribution networks 
if these local utilities are unable to properly operate their distribution networks  or if the operation of their distribution networks is interrupted for periods of time  we could be unable to deliver electricity or natural gas to our customers during those interruptions 
this would results in lost revenue to us  which could adversely impact the results of our operations 
we do not utilize bank lines of credit at this time and may have limited access to additional credit from banks and commodity suppliers 
as of july   we believe that we have adequate cash and liquidity and supplier lines of credit to sustain our business operations in the near term 
to expand our business in the future  we will likely pursue external financing from banks  other financial institutions and commodity suppliers 
in connection with financing arrangements  we may choose to pledge our accounts receivable and commodity inventory or commodity contracts as collateral to support the extension of credit 
additionally  we have issued and will continue to issue parent company guarantees of subsidiary obligations for commercial credit in connection with the arrangements for unsecured credit from commodity suppliers 
if the wholesale price of electricity decreases  we may be required to post letters of credit for margin to secure our obligations under our long term energy contracts 
as the price of the electricity we purchase under long term contracts is fixed over the term of the contracts  if the market price of wholesale electricity decreases below the contract price  the power generator may require us to post margin in the form of a letter of credit  or other collateral  to protect themselves against our potential default on the contract 
if we are required to post such security  a portion of our cash would become restricted  which could adversely affect our liquidity 
some suppliers of electricity have been experiencing deteriorating credit quality 
we continue to monitor the credit quality of our energy suppliers to attempt to reduce the impact of any potential counterparty default 
as of july   the majority of our counterparties are rated investment grade or above by the major rating agencies 
these ratings are subject to change at any time with no advance warning 
a deterioration in the credit quality of our energy suppliers could have an adverse impact on our sources of electricity purchases 
we are required to rely on utilities with whom we compete to perform some functions for our customers 
under the regulatory structures adopted in most jurisdictions  we are required to enter into agreements with local utilities for use of the local distribution systems  and for the creation and operation of functional interfaces necessary for us to serve our customers 
any delay in these negotiations or our inability to enter into reasonable agreements with those utilities could delay or negatively impact our ability to serve customers in those jurisdictions 
this could have a material negative impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are dependent on local utilities for maintenance of the infrastructure through which electricity and natural gas is delivered to our customers 
we are limited in our ability to control the level of service the utilities provide to our customers 
any infrastructure failure that interrupts or impairs delivery of electricity or natural gas to our customers could have a negative effect on the satisfaction of our customers with our service  
table of contents which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
regulations in many markets require that the services of reading our customers energy meters and the billing and collection process be retained by the local utility 
the local utility s systems and procedures may limit or slow down our ability to add customers 
we are required to rely on utilities with whom we compete to provide us accurate and timely data 
in some states  we are required to rely on the local utility to provide us with our customers energy usage data and to pay us for our customers usage based on what the local utility collects from our customers 
we may be limited in our ability or unable to confirm the accuracy of the information provided by the local utility 
in addition  we are unable to control when we receive customer payments from the local utility 
if we do not receive payments from the local utility on a timely basis  our working capital may be impaired 
in the event we do not receive timely or accurate usage data  our ability to generate timely and accurate bills to our customers will be adversely affected which  in turn  will impact the ability of our customers to pay bills in a timely manner 
we are subject to federal and state regulations in our electricity and natural gas marketing business and the rules and regulations of regional independent system operators  or isos  in our electricity business 
the rules under which we operate are imposed upon us by federal and state regulators  the regional isos and interstate pipelines 
the rules are subject to change  challenge and revision  including revision after the fact 
in california  the ferc and other regulatory and judicial bodies continue to examine the behavior of market participants during the california energy crisis of and  and to recalculate what market clearing prices should have or might have been under alternative scenarios of behavior by market participants 
in the event the historical costs of market operations were to be reallocated among market participants  we cannot predict whether the results would be favorable or unfavorable for us nor can we predict the amount of such adjustments 
the payment or receipt of adjustments  if any  will likely be conducted between ferc  the california iso and our contracted scheduling coordinator for the period in question  automated power exchange  or apx 
apx served as the direct interface with the now defunct california power exchange for the sale and purchase of some volumes of power by the company during and in pennsylvania  beginning in december  the iso established a seams elimination charge adjustment  or seca  to compensate transmission owners for the change in the regional through and out rates  or rtor  which eliminated some transmission charges and revenues from the iso system operations 
the impact on us  if any  is uncertain at this time 
compensatory payments to transmission owners are likely  but the recovery mechanism from customers  utilities or other load serving entities  such as us  is uncertain 
we can not predict the amount of these adjustments  if any  that it might be charged at this time 
in some markets  we are required to bear credit risk and billing responsibility for our customers 
in some markets  we are responsible for the billing and collection functions for our customers 
in these markets  we may be limited in our ability to terminate service to customers who are delinquent in payment 
even if we terminate service to customers who fail to pay their utility bill in a timely manner  we may remain liable to our suppliers of electricity or natural gas for the cost of the electricity or natural gas and to the local utilities for services related to the transmission and distribution of electricity or natural gas to those customers 
the failure of our customers to pay their bills in a timely manner or our failure to maintain adequate billing and collection programs could materially adversely affect our business 
our revenues and results of operations are subject to market risks that are beyond our control 
we sell electricity and natural gas that we purchase from third party power generation companies and natural gas producers to our retail customers on a contractual or monthly basis 
we are not guaranteed any rate of return through regulated rates  and our revenues and results of operations are likely to depend  in large part  upon prevailing market prices for electricity and natural gas in our regional markets 
these market prices may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time 
these factors could have an adverse impact on our revenues and results of operations 

table of contents volatility in market prices for electricity and natural gas results from multiple factors  including weather conditions  including hydrological conditions such as precipitation  snow pack and stream flow  seasonality  unexpected changes in customer usage  transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies  planned and unplanned plant or transmission line outages  demand for electricity  natural gas  crude oil and refined products  and coal supply availability to generators from whom we purchase electricity  natural disasters  wars  embargoes and other catastrophic events  and federal  state and foreign energy and environmental regulation and legislation 
we may experience difficulty in successfully integrating and managing acquired businesses and in realizing anticipated economic  operational and other benefits in a timely manner we recently completed an acquisition of assets in connection with the acn energy transaction 
the ultimate success of this acquisition will depend  in part  on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies  cost savings and growth opportunities from integrating the assets and the relationships acquired in the acn energy transaction into our existing businesses 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud 
as a result  current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  our operating results could be harmed 
we have in the past discovered  and may in the future discover  areas of our internal controls that need improvement 
for example  in january  we sold electricity commodity supply contracts related to a strategic realignment of our customer portfolio in the pennsylvania electricity market and the discontinuation of service to certain classes of residential and small commercial customers 
as a result of timing issues related to realigning the portfolio and inaccurately forecasting the resulting required electricity supply  we had transitional electricity supply obligations which could have been served more cost effectively with the original supply contract rather than with the current market cost of the replacement power 
in the execution of this portfolio realignment  we observed deficiencies in our internal controls relating to monitoring the operational progress of the realignment 
these internal control deficiencies constituted reportable conditions  and collectively  a material weakness that caused us to restate our second quarter reported results 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended july   we determined that a certain electricity forward physical contracts and financial derivatives designated as cash flow hedges lacked adequate documentation of our method of measurement and testing of hedge effectiveness to meet the cash flow hedge requirements of sfas no 
and b a forward physical contract and several financial derivative contracts had been inappropriately accounted for as exempt from hedge accounting under sfas no 
these errors in the proper application of the provisions of sfas no 
required us to restate our previously reported results for each of the first three quarters in fiscal and led us to conclude and report the existence of a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting 
we purchase substantially all of our power and natural gas under forward physical delivery contracts  which are defined as commodity derivative contracts under sfas no 
we also utilize other financial derivatives  primarily swaps  options and futures  to hedge our price risks 
accordingly  proper accounting for these contracts is very important to our overall ability to report timely and accurate financial results 
we have devoted significant resources to remediate and improve our internal controls 
although we believe that these efforts have strengthened our internal controls and addressed the concerns that gave rise to the reportable conditions and material weaknesses in fiscal and  we are continuing to work to improve our internal controls  particularly in the area of energy accounting 
we cannot be certain that these 
table of contents measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future 
any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock 
investor confidence and share value may be adversely impacted if our independent auditors are unable to provide us with the attestation of the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting as of july  or july   as applicable  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of as directed by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  the securities and exchange commission adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on our internal controls over financial reporting in our annual reports on form k that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
in addition  our independent auditors must attest to and report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
this requirement may first apply to our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ending july  if the aggregate market value of the voting and non voting common equity held by non affiliates is million or more as of the last business day of january if not  such requirement will first apply to our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ending july  how companies should be implementing these new requirements  including internal control reforms  if any  to comply with section s requirements  and how independent auditors will apply these new requirements and test companies internal controls  are subject to uncertainty 
although we are diligently and vigorously reviewing our internal controls over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with the new section requirements  if our independent auditors are not satisfied with our internal controls over financial reporting or the level at which these controls are documented  designed  operated or reviewed  or if the independent auditors interpret the requirements  rules or regulations differently than we do  then they may decline to attest to management s assessment or may issue a report that is qualified 
this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which ultimately could negatively impact the market price of our shares 
we have initiated a company wide review of our internal controls over financial reporting as part of the process of preparing for compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and as a complement to our existing overall program of internal controls over financial reporting 
as a result of this on going review  we have made numerous improvements to the design and effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting through the period ended july  we anticipate that improvements will continue to be made

in addition  the adoption of sfas no

we expect that the adoption of sfas no 
r will result in an expense for fiscal of approximately  for options issued as of july  however  uncertainties  including our future stock based compensation strategy  stock price volatility  estimated forfeitures and employee stock option exercise behavior  make it difficult to determine whether the stock based compensation expense that we will incur in future periods will be similar to the sfas no 
pro forma expense disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the amount of stock based compensation expense to be incurred in future periods was reduced by our acceleration of  unvested and out of the money stock options in fiscal 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our activities expose us to a variety of market risks principally from the change in and volatility of commodity prices 
we have established risk management policies and procedures designed to manage these risks with a strong focus on the retail nature of our business and to reduce the potentially adverse effects these risks may have on our operating results 
our board of directors and the audit committee of the board oversee the risk management program  including the approval of risk management policies and procedures 
this program is predicated on a strong risk management focus combined with the establishment of an effective system of internal controls 
we have a risk oversight committee  or roc  that is responsible for establishing risk management policies  reviewing procedures for the identification  assessment  measurement and management of risks  and the monitoring and reporting of risk exposures 
the roc is comprised of all key members of senior management and is chaired by the vice president of risk management 
commodity risk management commodity price and volume risk arise from the potential for changes in the price of  and transportation costs for  electricity and natural gas  the volatility of commodity prices  and usage fluctuations due to changes in weather and or customer usage patterns 
a number of factors associated with the structure and operation of the energy markets significantly influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products 
these factors include seasonal daily and hourly changes in demand  extreme peak demands due to weather conditions  available supply resources  transportation availability and reliability within and between geographic regions  procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical electricity system during extreme conditions  and changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations 
these factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees 
supplying electricity and natural gas to our retail customers requires us to match the projected demand of our customers with contractual purchase commitments from our suppliers at fixed or indexed prices 
we primarily use forward physical energy purchases and derivative instruments to minimize significant  unanticipated earnings fluctuations caused by commodity price volatility 
derivative instruments are used to limit the unfavorable effect that price increases will have on electricity and natural gas purchases  effectively fixing the future purchase price of electricity or natural gas for the applicable forecasted usage and protecting the company from significant price volatility 
derivative instruments measured at fair market value are recorded on the balance sheet as an asset or liability 
changes in fair market value are recognized currently in earnings if specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
with most electricity and natural gas customers  we have the ability to change prices with short notice  and  therefore  the impact on gross profits from increases in energy prices is not material for these customers 
however  sharp and sustained price increases could result in customer attrition without corresponding price increases by local utilities and other competitors 
approximately of the company s electricity customers are subject to multi month fixed priced unhedged contracts and  accordingly a per megawatt hour increase in the cost of purchased power could result in an estimated  decrease in gross profit for fiscal a similar relative increase in the price of natural gas would have no impact on gross profit for fiscal as the company does not have any significant unhedged fixed price term obligations in natural gas 
while some of the contracts we use to manage risk represent commodities or instruments for which prices are available from external sources  other commodities and certain contracts are not actively traded and are valued using other pricing sources and modeling techniques to determine expected future market prices  contract quantities  or both 
we use our best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative contracts we hold and sell 
these estimates consider various factors including closing exchange and over the counter price quotations  time value  volatility factors and credit exposure 
we do not engage in trading activities in the wholesale energy market other than to manage our direct energy cost in an attempt to improve the profit margin associated with the requirements of our retail customers 
credit risk the company s primary credit risks are exposure to our retail customers counterparty credit risk based on the credit terms extended to the company 
given the high credit quality of the majority of the company s energy suppliers  credit risk resulting from failure of our suppliers to deliver or perform on their contracted energy commitments is not considered significant 

table of contents retail credit risk results from potential customer default on their contractual obligations 
retail credit risk is managed through established credit policies which actively requires screening of customer credit prior to contracting with a customer  potentially requiring deposits from customers and actively discontinuing business with customers that do not pay as contractually obligated 
retail credit quality is dependent on the economy and the ability of our customers to manage through unfavorable economic cycles and other market changes 
if the business environment were to be negatively affected by changes in economic or other market conditions  our retail credit risk may be adversely impacted 
counterparty credit risks result primarily from credit extended to us for our purchases of energy from our suppliers 
favorable credit terms from our suppliers make it easier to procure wholesale energy to service our customers  however  adverse market conditions or poor financial performance by us may result in a reduction or elimination of available unsecured counterparty credit lines 
additionally  we have significant amounts of energy commitments to our contracted term customers that we have hedged forward  often for several months 
a significant decrease in energy prices could adversely impact our cash collateral requirements 
interest rate risk since we had no short or long term debt outstanding at july   our only exposure to interest rate risks is limited to our investment of excess cash balances in interest bearing instruments 
we generally invest cash equivalents in short term credit instruments consisting primarily of high credit quality  short term money market funds and insured  remarketable government agency securities with interest rate reset maturities of days or less 
we do not expect any material loss from our investments and we believe that our potential interest rate exposure is not material 
as our practice has been  and currently continues to be  to only invest in high quality debt instruments with maturities or remarketing dates of days or less  we currently are not materially susceptible to interest rate risks
