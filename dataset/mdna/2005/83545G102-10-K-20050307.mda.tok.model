item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the sonic automotive  inc and subsidiaries consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report on form k 
overview we are one of the largest automotive retailers in the united states 
as of march  we operated dealership franchises  representing different brands of cars and light trucks  at locations and collision repair centers in states 
our dealerships provide comprehensive services including sales of both new and used cars and light trucks  sales of replacement parts  performance of vehicle maintenance  manufacturer warranty repairs  paint and collision repair services  and arrangement of extended service contracts  financing  insurance  vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products for our customers 
in addition  although vehicle sales are cyclical and are affected by many factors  including general economic conditions  consumer confidence  levels of discretionary personal income  interest rates and available credit  our parts  service and collision repair services are not closely tied to vehicle sales and are not as dependent upon near term sales volume 
as a result  we believe the diversity of these products and services reduces the risk of periodic economic downturns 
the automobile industry s total amount of new vehicles sold increased by to million vehicles in from million vehicles in this was the first annual increase in industry sales since many 
table of contents factors such as brand and geographic concentrations have caused our past results to differ from the industry s total amount of new vehicles sold 
in  our import stores performance fell short of the industry s import unit sales growth and our domestic stores underperformed the industry s domestic sales contraction of 
the following table depicts the breakdown of our new vehicle revenues by brand for each of the past three years percentage of new vehicle revenues year ended december  brand honda bmw cadillac general motors toyota ford lexus volvo mercedes chrysler nissan volkswagen hyundai audi other luxury other total in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  income statement data reflects reclassifications from the prior years presentation to exclude additional franchises sold and terminated or identified for sale subsequent to december  which had not been previously included in discontinued operations and include franchises which had been identified for sale as of december  but which we have now decided to retain and operate 
includes buick  chevrolet  gmc  oldsmobile  pontiac and saturn includes chrysler  dodge and jeep includes acura  hummer  infiniti  jaguar  land rover  maybach  morgan  porsche and saab includes isuzu  kia  lincoln  mercury  mini  mitsubishi  scion and subaru we sell similar products and services that exhibit similar economic characteristics  use similar processes in selling our products and services and sell our products and services to similar classes of customers 
as a result of this and the way we manage our business  we have aggregated our operating segments into a single segment for purposes of reporting financial condition and results of operations 
in the ordinary course of business we evaluate our dealership franchises for possible disposition based on various performance criteria 
during the year ended december   we sold franchises  terminated franchises  and had approved  but not completed  the disposition of additional franchises 
these franchises are generally franchises with unprofitable operations 
we believe the disposition of these dealerships will allow us to focus our management attention on those remaining stores with the highest potential return on investment 

table of contents use of estimates and critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the most subjective and complex judgments 
the following is a discussion of what we believe are our critical accounting policies and estimates 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding our accounting policies 
finance  insurance and service contracts we arrange financing for customers through various financial institutions and receive a commission from the lender either in a flat fee amount or in an amount equal to the difference between the actual interest rates charged to customers and the predetermined base rates set by the financing institution 
we also receive commissions from the sale of various insurance contracts and non recourse third party extended service contracts to customers 
under these contracts  the applicable manufacturer or third party warranty company is directly liable for all warranties provided within the contract 
in the event a customer terminates a financing  insurance or extended service contract prior to the original termination date  we may be required to return a portion of the commission revenue originally recorded to the third party provider chargebacks 
the commission revenue for the sale of these products and services is recorded net of estimated chargebacks at the time of sale 
our estimate of future chargebacks is established based on our historical chargeback rates  termination provisions of the applicable contracts and industry data 
while chargeback rates vary depending on the type of contract sold  a basis point change in the estimated chargeback rates used in determining our estimates of future chargebacks would have changed our estimated reserve for chargebacks at december  by million 
our estimate of chargebacks million as of december  is influenced by early contract termination events such as vehicle repossessions  refinancings and early pay off 
if these factors change  the resulting impact is a change in our estimate for chargebacks 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of million relating to finance  insurance and extended service contracts as a result of a change in estimates for chargeback rates 
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually  or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that impairment might have occurred 
based on criteria established by the applicable accounting pronouncements  we allocate the carrying value of goodwill and test it for impairment based on our geographic divisions 
the  million of goodwill on our balance sheet  including approximately million classified in assets held for sale  at december  is allocated to the following geographic divisions dollars in millions northern division southeastern division central division western division in evaluating goodwill for impairment  we compare the carrying value of the goodwill allocated to each division to the fair value of the underlying dealerships in each division 
this represents the first step of the impairment test 
if the fair value of a division is less than the carrying value of the goodwill allocated to that division  we are then required to proceed to the second step of the impairment test 
the second step involves allocating the calculated fair value to all of the assets of the respective division as if the calculated fair value was the purchase price of the business combination 
this allocation would include assigning value to any previously unrecognized identifiable assets which means the fair value that would be allocated to goodwill is significantly reduced 
see discussion regarding franchise agreements acquired prior to july  in note to our 
table of contents consolidated financial statements 
we then compare the value of the goodwill resulting from this allocation process to the carrying value of the goodwill in the respective division with the difference representing the amount of impairment 
we use several assumptions and various fair value approaches in estimating the fair value of the goodwill in each division 
these assumptions and approaches include an earnings multiple for private dealership valuations as determined by the historical multiple paid for dealerships we have purchased applied to actual earnings  an earnings multiple for public consolidators in our peer group applied to actual earnings  and a discounted cash flow utilizing estimated future earnings and our weighted average cost of capital 
these approaches are blended to arrive at a fair value of goodwill for each division 
at december  the date of our latest impairment test  the fair value of each of our divisions exceeded the carrying value of the goodwill allocated to them step one of the impairment test 
as a result  we were not required to conduct the second step of the impairment test described above  and we recognized no impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill on our balance sheet at december  however  if in future periods we determine that the fair value of the goodwill allocated to one or more of our divisions is less than the carrying value of the goodwill allocated to such division s  we believe that application of the second step of the impairment test would result in a substantial impairment charge to the goodwill allocated to such division s and the amount of such impairment charge would likely be materially adverse to our consolidated operating results  financial position and cash flows 
insurance reserves we have various self insured and high deductible insurance programs which require us to make estimates in determining the ultimate liability we may incur for claims arising under these programs 
these insurance reserves are estimated by management using actuarial evaluations based on historical claims experience  claims processing procedures  medical cost trends and  in certain cases  a discount factor 
we estimate the ultimate liability under these programs is between million and million 
at december   we had million reserved for such programs 
we used an experience modification factor in estimating reserves for workers compensation claims of 
a change of five basis points in this factor would change the reserve by million 
we used a discount rate of to calculate the present value of our estimated workers compensation claims 
a change of basis points in the discount rate would change the reserve by million 
a discount rate of was used to calculate the present value of our general liability claim reserves 
a change of basis points in the discount rate would have changed the reserve by million 
legal proceedings we are involved  and will continue to be involved  in numerous legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business  including litigation with customers  employment related lawsuits  contractual disputes  class actions  purported class actions and actions brought by governmental authorities 
during we recorded an additional million in legal reserves 
currently  with the exception of the tada litigation discussed in item legal proceedings herein  no legal proceedings are pending against or involve us that  in the opinion of management  could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
however  the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty  and an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and prospects 
classification of franchises in continuing and discontinued operations we classify the results from operations of our continuing and discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income based on the provisions of sfas no 
many of these provisions involve judgment in determining whether a franchise will be reported as continuing or discontinued operations 
such judgments include whether a franchise will be sold or terminated  the period required to complete the disposition and the likelihood of changes to a plan for sale 
if in future periods we determine that a franchise should be either reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations or from discontinued operations to continuing operations  previously reported consolidated statements of income may be reclassified in order to reflect the current classification 

table of contents income taxes as a matter of course  we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities and from time to time  these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes 
we believe that our tax positions comply in all material respects with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
included in other accrued liabilities at december  and are million in reserves that we have provided for these matters 
we have million in deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards that will expire between and management reviews these carryforward positions  the time remaining until expiration and other opportunities to utilize these carryforwards in making an assessment as to whether it is more likely than not that these carryforwards will be utilized 
based on our judgment  we have not recorded a valuation allowance because it is more likely than not that taxable income for these states will be sufficient to realize the benefits of the associated deferred tax assets 
however  the results of future operations  regulatory framework of these taxing authorities and other related matters cannot be predicted with certainty 
therefore  actual utilization of the losses which created these deferred tax assets which differs from the assumptions used in the development of our judgment could result in a charge that will be material to our consolidated operating results  financial position and cash flows 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting issues related to certain features of contingently convertible debt and the effect on diluted earnings per share 
issue no 
requires issuers of contingently convertible securities to include the dilutive effect of these securities in the calculation of dilutive weighted average shares outstanding  regardless of whether conversion is likely  starting with periods ending after december  issue no 
also requires retroactive application to all prior periods for which contingently convertible securities were outstanding 
we have adopted the conclusion of issue no 
and have determined the impact on our consolidated diluted earnings per share using the if converted method to be a reduction of  and for diluted net income per share for the years ended december  and  respectively  while there was no impact for the year ended december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supercedes apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period 
tax benefits associated with share based payments will be recognized as an addition to paid in capital 
cash retained as a result of these tax benefits will be presented in the statement of cash flows as financing cash inflows 
we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas no 
r and have not determined the impact on our consolidated operating results  financial position and cash flows 

table of contents results of operations the following table summarizes the percentages of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in our consolidated statements of income

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  income statement data reflects reclassifications from the prior years presentation to exclude additional franchises sold and terminated or identified for sale subsequent to december  which had not been previously included in discontinued operations and include franchises which had been identified for sale as of december  but which we have now decided to retain and operate 
during the year ended december   we sold franchises  terminated franchises  and had approved  but not completed  the disposition of additional franchises 
the results of operations of these dealerships  including gains or losses on disposition  have been included in discontinued operations on the accompanying consolidated statements of income for all periods presented 
in addition to these dispositions  during the years ended december  and  we disposed of and franchises  respectively 
annual same store results of operations represent the aggregate of the same store results for each of the four quarters in that year 
same store results for each quarter include dealerships that were owned and operated for the entire quarter in both periods 
unless otherwise noted  our discussion of the results of operations is on a same store basis 
new vehicles new vehicle revenues include both the sale and lease of new vehicles  as well as the sale of fleet vehicles 
new vehicle revenues are highly dependent on manufacturer incentives  which vary from cash back incentives to low interest rate financing 
new vehicle revenues are also dependent on manufacturers for adequate vehicle allocations to meet customer demands 

table of contents the automobile manufacturing industry is cyclical and historically has experienced periodic downturns characterized by oversupply and weak demand 
as an automotive retailer  we seek to mitigate the effects of this cyclicality by maintaining a diverse mix of domestic and import branded dealerships 
our brand diversity allows us to offer a broad range of products at a wide range of prices from lower priced  or economy vehicles  to luxury vehicles 
we believe that this diversity reduces the risk of changes in customer preferences  product supply shortages and aging products 
for the year ended december   of our total new vehicle revenue was generated by import and luxury dealerships compared to for we expect this trend toward more import and domestic luxury dealerships to continue 
we believe demographic and other trends favor luxury and near luxury brands and expect our acquisition activity in the future to concentrate primarily  but not completely  on these brands 
we expect that industry wide new vehicle sales will continue their overall long term trend of growing modestly faster than population growth after considering the impact of normal business cycles 
we also believe the trend toward ownership of more vehicles per household will continue 
for the year ended units or change change for the year ended units or change change total new vehicle units same store acquisitions and other total as reported total new vehicle revenues in thousands same store acquisitions and other total as reported total new vehicle unit price same store total dealerships as reported our same store new vehicle unit sales decline in was driven by import dealerships decreases of  units  or  and domestic dealership decreases of  units  or  as compared to our toyota dealerships declined  units  or  compared to due to increased competition at several of our locations and extremely high unit volume in due to a strategic decision in to increase our market share at several of our key toyota dealerships 
our honda dealerships decreased  units  or  which was primarily attributed to turnover in dealership management  increased competition in key markets and high sales volume in our top performing import brands for were bmw  acura and hyundai which had a combined increase of  units  or 
the majority of the domestic dealership declines were from our chrysler and ford dealerships down and  respectively 
our ford dealerships experienced above average market declines and continued to show lower sales volumes during the current year 
we believe this decline is in part attributed to stronger competition with gm which is offering attractive incentive packages 
our gm  excluding cadillac  dealerships increased  units  or  for the year  and was our only domestic brand that had an increase in same store units sold for on a geographic basis  our strongest performing regions were north los angeles up units  or and birmingham tennessee up units  or  both of which have a high concentration of import and or luxury brands 
these regions offset some significant decreases in the unit sales of other regions with concentrations of domestic dealerships  the most notable being ohio down  or  dallas down  or and houston down  or 
florida had a decline in new units sold of  or  which was partially attributed to four hurricanes that disrupted the region during the third quarter of however  subsequent to the hurricane disruptions  vehicle sales posted positive increases in the final months of in addition  san diego and south los angeles experienced decreases of  units  or  as compared to 
table of contents all of our dealerships except honda and volvo stores experienced sales price per unit increases during generally due to increases in the manufacturers suggested retail price 
during  total same store new vehicle unit sales remained relatively flat because of offsetting increases in our import dealerships and decreases in our domestic dealerships 
our import dealerships experienced increases of  units  or  as compared to this is compared to an industry increase in unit sales at import dealerships generally of 
our toyota  honda and volvo dealerships experienced combined growth of  units  or 
these increases can be primarily attributed to the introduction of new models and new body styles for existing models 
on a geographic basis  our strongest performing regions were san diego nevada up  units  or  birmingham tennessee up units  or and northern california up  units  or  all of which have a high concentration of import and or luxury brands 
our domestic dealerships experienced unit sales declines of  units  or  during this was compared to an industry decrease in unit sales at domestic dealerships of 
our ford dealerships were responsible for of the domestic decline due primarily to ford s continued loss of market share to import brands 
also  the central division which consists of the dallas  houston and oklahoma regions experienced decreases of  units  or  as compared to  because of a concentration of domestic dealerships and local economic factors such as unusually high unemployment rates compared to the national average 
our gm  excluding cadillac  and chrysler dealerships were responsible for the remainder of our domestic decline  experiencing decreases of  units  or  and units  or  respectively 
all of our dealerships except bmw  toyota and vw stores experienced sales price per unit increases during our honda  cadillac  volvo and lexus dealerships experienced the most significant price increases due to an increase in truck and sport utility vehicle sales 
however  the average price per unit at our bmw dealerships decreased because of increased competition in the luxury sport utility vehicle market 
the average price per unit at our toyota dealerships remained relatively flat 
used vehicles used vehicle revenues are directly affected by the level of manufacturer incentives on new vehicles  the number and quality of trade ins and lease turn ins and the availability of consumer credit 
in addition  various manufacturers provide franchised dealers the opportunity to certify pre owned vehicles cpo vehicles based on criteria established by the manufacturer 
this certification process extends the standard manufacturer warranty 
we believe the used vehicle business will become more clearly segmented and cpo vehicles and similar products will continue to grow as a larger share of dealership used vehicle sales 
our sales of cpo vehicles increased to  units in of total units from  units in of total units  an increase 
for the year ended units or change change for the year ended units or change change total used vehicle units same store acquisitions and other total as reported total used vehicle revenues in thousands same store acquisitions and other total as reported total used vehicle unit price same store total dealerships as reported we continued to experience challenges in the used vehicle market in due to manufacturer incentives on new vehicles 
since these new vehicle incentives remain attractive to consumers  we expect volume and pricing pressure to continue in the used vehicle market 
we have  however  seen pricing begin to stabilize and improve as there are fewer low mileage vehicles coming off of lease than historically experienced 

table of contents the decreases in used units sold occurred primarily in our domestic dealerships 
the largest percentage declines in used units sold were in our colorado and ohio regions and our san diego market down units  or  units  or  and units  or  respectively 
used unit sales in our florida region declined by  or  due primarily to the hurricanes that disrupted the region during the third quarter 
consistent with new vehicle sales  florida used vehicle units posted positive increases in the final months of our florida  colorado and ohio regions represented of the total unit decline in the remaining decreases were generally evenly distributed throughout our other geographic regions with only one region  birmingham tennessee  which has a high concentration of import and or luxury brands reporting a relatively strong increase of 
despite the decline in used unit volumes  the average used selling price per unit increased or for compared to the prior year 
the average price per unit increase in was in line with the industry increase of approximately 
the average increase per unit was attributable to an increase in cpo vehicles sold as a percentage of total used units sold increasing from in to in 
during  the used vehicle market faced challenging conditions arising from the continuation of significant manufacturer incentives on new vehicles and a lack of sub prime credit availability 
the central division was most adversely affected by these factors due to a greater dependence on used vehicle sales than our other divisions 
this division accounted for of our total same store used unit decline in the available credit in the sub prime category declined due to certain national lenders reducing their exposure in this area and other lenders increasing their credit standards 
we reduced the effect of the sub prime credit market s tightening by utilizing regional finance sources to replace the national lenders and by increasing the number of units that we financed through our wholly owned sub prime lending company  cornerstone acceptance 
the declines in used unit sales generated in the central division were partially offset by increases in unit sales volume in the san diego nevada up  ohio up  and mid atlantic up regions 
wholesale vehicles wholesale vehicle revenues are highly correlated with new and used vehicle retail sales and the associated trade in volume 
wholesale revenues are also significantly affected by our corporate inventory management policies which are designed to optimize our total used vehicle inventory 
for the year ended units or change change for the year ended units or change change total wholesale vehicle units same store acquisitions and other total as reported total wholesale vehicle revenues in thousands same store acquisitions and other total as reported total wholesale unit price same store total dealerships as reported higher revenues realized in were driven by higher unit sales prices for both our domestic and import dealerships which increased and  respectively 
favorable pricing increases followed the increases experienced in used retail sales and were consistent with the industry 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in domestic dealership unit volume 
lower vehicle retail sales activity  the principal source of wholesale vehicles via trade in  contributed to the lower volume 

table of contents during  the decrease in same store wholesale vehicle revenues was due to a decrease in retail units sold in our domestic dealerships 
our domestic dealerships total new and used retail units sold decreased  units  or  thus there were fewer vehicles available for trade ins 
therefore  there were fewer vehicles that required wholesaling 
conversely  our import dealerships wholesale unit sales remained flat  while import dealerships retail unit sales increased 
this was the result of more effective sales practices as compared to our domestic dealerships 
parts  service and collision repair fixed operations parts and service revenue consists of customer requested repairs customer pay  warranty repairs  retail parts  wholesale parts and collision repairs 
same store revenue from these items was as follows amounts in thousands for the year ended change change for the year ended change change service parts collision repair service revenue is driven by the mix of warranty repairs versus customer pay repairs  available service capacity  vehicle quality and manufacturer warranty programs 
during  of our service and parts revenue was generated by warranty repairs and by customer pay repairs compared to by warranty repairs and by customer pay repairs in we believe that  over time  vehicle quality will improve but that vehicle complexity will offset any revenue lost from improvement in vehicle quality 
we also believe we have the ability  through our access to capital  to continue to add service capacity and increase revenues 
in addition  manufacturers continue to extend new vehicle warranty periods and have also begun to include regular maintenance items in the warranty coverage 
these factors  combined with the extended manufacturer warranties on cpo vehicles see the discussion in business business strategy certified pre owned vehicles above  should allow continued growth in our service and parts business 
parts revenue is driven by the mix of warranty repairs versus customer pay repairs as prices for warranty parts are established by the manufacturer 
we believe that long term trends in retail parts sales will be affected by the same trends as discussed above for service additional capacity  customer satisfaction  etc one of the key metrics we use to analyze the profitability of our fixed operations business is fixed absorption 
this metric represents the percentage of a dealership s fixed costs which are covered by the operating profit of the service  parts  and collision repair departments 
our fixed absorption rate was in compared to in we believe that we substantially exceed the industry s average fixed absorption rate 
as of december   we operated collision repair centers 
collision revenues are heavily impacted by trends in the automotive insurance industry 
over the last few years collision repair revenues have either declined or remained flat because customers are choosing higher deductible policies  thus choosing not to make minor repairs that were previously covered by lower deductible policies 
also  insurance companies generally are declaring more vehicles totaled in recent years  thus  the vehicles do not need to be repaired 
for the year ended change change for the year ended change change total parts  service and collision repair in thousands same store acquisitions and other total as reported 
table of contents same store fixed operations revenues increased slightly during  primarily due to the performance of our import dealerships up outpacing decreases in our domestic dealerships down 
warranty sales at our import dealerships increased million  or 
our bmw dealerships experienced an increase in revenues of million  or  compared to as a result of bmw s vehicle maintenance programs and strong same store new vehicle sales 
these import increases were partially offset by decreases in our domestic dealerships  which declined million  or  compared to the overall domestic dealership revenue declines primarily relate to our ford dealerships which decreased million  or  compared to the declines in our ford dealerships were primarily caused by a decrease in wholesale parts sales of million  or 
our ford wholesale parts revenues have continued to decrease during as competition has increased and the scale of those operations have declined 
in addition  consistent with unit declines in new vehicles of  warranty sales at our ford stores experienced declines of million  or  as compared to same store collision revenues were flat when compared to same store fixed operations revenues increased during  primarily from the strong performance of our import dealerships 
our honda and bmw dealerships experienced increases of million  or  and million  or  respectively  compared to increases in our import dealerships were primarily attributable to warranty work as import manufacturers continue to extend warranty periods and include regular maintenance items as part of their new vehicle manufacturer warranty 
warranty sales at our import dealerships increased million  or 
these import increases were partially offset by decreases in our domestic dealerships  which declined million  or  compared to domestic dealerships revenues were largely impacted by our ford stores which experienced declines of million  or  compared to the declines in our ford dealerships were primarily caused by a decrease in wholesale parts sales of million  or  because of ford motor company s decision to open a parts depot in the houston area in the second half of near a sonic wholesale parts operation 
also  warranty sales at our ford stores experienced declines of million  or  as compared to same store collision revenues increased slightly due to greater capacity and the relocation of an existing collision center to a new stand alone location 
finance  insurance and other finance  insurance and other revenues include commissions for arranging vehicle financing and insurance  sales of third party extended service contracts for vehicles  vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products 
in connection with vehicle financing  service contracts  vehicle protection products  other aftermarket products and insurance contracts  we receive a commission from the provider for originating the contract 
finance  insurance and other revenues are driven by the level of new and used vehicle sales  manufacturer financing or leasing incentives and our penetration rate 
the penetration rate represents the percentage of vehicle sales on which we are able to originate financing or sell extended service contracts  vehicle protection products  other aftermarket products or insurance contracts 
our finance penetration rate increased to in from in our extended service contract penetration rate increased to in from in we expect our finance and insurance penetration rate to increase over time as we continue to emphasize the sale of extended service contracts and other products

finance and insurance revenues in the florida region declined million  or  in within the central division  dallas and oklahoma experienced declines of million  or  and million  or  respectively  compared to in the western division  the colorado and san diego regions also experienced large revenue declines  million  or  and million or   respectively 
these declines were partially offset by increases in our regions that have a strong bmw presence 
our tennessee birmingham region experienced finance and insurance revenue increases during of million  or 
ford dealerships represented the majority of the decline among the domestic brands 
import dealerships saw a decline in retail unit sales of  but a disproportionate finance and insurance revenue decline of million  or 
our honda and toyota dealerships led the decline with decreases of million  or  and million  or  respectively 
both the honda and toyota declines were attributable to large decreases both in the number of retail units sold and the amount of revenue per unit 
these import declines were partially offset by our bmw dealerships which increased revenue million  or  vs

our san diego nevada region experienced finance and insurance revenue increases during of million  or 
additionally  our volvo stores experienced significant revenue increases of million  or  compared to gross profit and gross margins our overall gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenues generally vary depending on changes in our revenue mix 
although sales of new vehicles comprise the majority of our total revenues  new vehicles generally carry the lowest margin rate of any product or service we offer 
as a result  sales of new vehicles comprise a relatively small portion of total gross profits when compared to revenue 
retail sales of used vehicles generally carry a slightly higher gross margin rate than new vehicles 
parts  service and collision repair carry a higher gross margin rate than retail used sales 
for the year ended change change for the year ended change change total gross profit in thousands same store acquisitions and other total as reported the overall gross margin rate on our various revenue lines on a same store basis were as follows for the year ended basis point change for the year ended basis point change new vehicles used vehicles retail wholesale vehicles parts  service and collision repair finance  insurance and other overall gross margin 
table of contents the overall same store gross margin percentage remained flat at in and  primarily due to lower finance and insurance revenues resulting from lower overall units retailed 
improvements experienced in all other categories were offset by the effect of finance and insurance activities 
the largest increases in margin percentages relate to used and wholesale vehicles which were primarily attributed to price increases driven by a lower supply of higher quality used vehicles than in previous years 
fixed operations gross margin percentages improved primarily due to increases experienced at our high volume bmw and honda dealerships 
the overall same store gross margin percentage declined to in from in  primarily due to continued pressure on new and used retail vehicle margins 
our overall gross margin also declined due to the fact that a higher percentage of our total revenues are being generated by new vehicle sales which have the lowest gross margin of all our business lines 
on a same store basis  new vehicle revenue grew to of our total revenue in from in this was offset somewhat by the fact that the percentage of revenue contributed by fixed operations increased to in from in due to the fact that some manufacturers have extended warranty periods on certain models and the increasing trend of certain manufacturers to include regular maintenance items in their new vehicle standard warranty 
the percentage of revenue contributed by finance and insurance revenues decreased slightly to in from in new vehicle gross margins decreased to in from in  due to an effort on our part to increase market share and maintain appropriate inventory levels 
used vehicle margin percentage decreased to in from in  because of new vehicle incentives and a shortage of quality trade ins and lease turn ins 
these retail vehicle decreases were slightly offset by a favorable decrease in the wholesale loss percentage to in from in declining vehicle margins were partially offset by an increase in the parts  service  and collision margin percentage to in from in selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses are comprised of four major groups compensation expenses  advertising expense  operating rent and rent related expense  and other expense 
compensation expense primarily relates to dealership personnel who are paid a commission or a modest salary plus commission which typically varies depending on gross profits realized and support personnel who are paid a fixed salary 
due to the salary component of dealership personnel s compensation  gross profits and compensation expense are not correlated 
advertising expense and other expense vary based on the level of actual or anticipated business activity and number of dealerships owned 
rent and rent related expense typically vary with the number of dealerships owned  investments made for facility improvements and interest rates 
although not completely correlated  we believe the best way to measure sg a expenses is as a percentage of gross profit 
for the year ended change change for the year ended change change total sg a in thousands same store acquisitions and other total as reported total sg a expense rose for the year ended compared to as a result of acquisitions 
the increase from acquisitions was somewhat offset by lower spending on a same store basis 
however  as a percentage of gross profit  sg a expenses improved slightly from in to in this improvement was driven by decreases in compensation expense and advertising expense offset slightly by increases in rent and other variable expenses 
total compensation expense increased million in compared with this increase was caused by a million decline on a same store basis offset by a increase due to acquisitions 
compensation expense as a percentage of gross profit in improved to from in during  we

in order to reduce our exposure to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates  we have two separate interest rate swap agreements the fixed swaps to effectively convert a portion of our libor based variable rate debt to a fixed rate 
the first swap agreement matured october  and had a notional principal amount of million

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we require cash to finance acquisitions and fund debt service and working capital requirements 
we rely on cash flows from operations  borrowings under our revolving facility and offerings of debt and equity securities to meet these requirements 
because the majority of our consolidated assets are held by our dealership subsidiaries  the majority of our cash flows from operations is generated by these subsidiaries 
as a result  our cash flows and ability to service debt depends to a substantial degree on the results of operations of these subsidiaries and their ability to provide us with cash 
uncertainties in the economic environment as well as uncertainties associated with the ultimate resolution of geopolitical conflicts may therefore affect our overall liquidity 
a significant portion of our cash flow is used to fund dealership acquisitions 
following is a summary of acquisition activity in recent years in millions subsequent year revenues cash portion of purchase price net of cash acquired acquisitions acquisitions acquisitions acquisitions acquisitions revenues are estimated prior to we had maintained a long term debt to total capital ratio of approximately to depending on the timing of our dealership acquisitions 
we expect to limit our acquisition activity in and to approximately of annual revenues 
we believe this reduced pace will allow us to reduce our debt to total capital ratio to over the next few years 
at december  our long term debt to total capital ratio was 
our long term debt structure consists of the revolving facility due in and various senior subordinated notes due in and these are discussed in more detail below 
we believe the combination of cash flows from operations  and the availability under our revolving facility approximately million at december  is sufficient to fund both our working capital needs and the targeted acquisition level discussed above 
floor plan facilities we finance all of our new vehicle inventory through standardized floor plan facilities with daimlerchrysler financial company  llc daimlerchrysler financial  ford motor credit company ford credit  general motors acceptance corporation gmac  toyota financial services toyota financial  bank of america and jp morgan chase bank 
these floor plan facilities bear interest at variable rates based on prime and libor 
the weighted average interest rate for all our floor plan facilities was for and for our floor plan interest expense is offset by amounts received from manufacturers  in the form of floor plan assistance 
floor plan assistance received is capitalized in inventory and charged against cost of sales when the associated inventory is sold 
in  we received approximately million in manufacturer assistance  which resulted in an effective borrowing rate under our floor plan facilities of 
interest payments under each of our floor plan facilities are due monthly and we are generally not required to make principal repayments prior to the sale of the vehicles 

table of contents long term debt and credit facilities the revolving facility at december  our revolving facility had a borrowing limit of million  subject to a borrowing base calculated on the basis of our receivables  inventory and equipment and a pledge of certain additional collateral by one of our affiliates the borrowing base was approximately million at december  
the amount available to be borrowed under the revolving facility is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by the cumulative face amount of outstanding letters of credit 
at december   we had million in letters of credit outstanding and million of borrowing availability 
the amounts outstanding under the revolving facility bear interest at percentage points above libor 
the total outstanding balance was approximately million as of december  balances under our revolving facility are guaranteed by our operating domestic subsidiaries 
the revolving facility expires on october  senior subordinated and notes on august   we issued million in aggregate principal amount of notes 
the net proceeds  before expenses  of approximately million together with an advance from our revolving facility  were used to redeem all of the notes for million which included accrued but unpaid interest and the redemption premium of on september  a resulting loss of million  which includes the redemption premium  and the write off of unamortized discounts and deferred debt issuance costs is included in other income expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for on november  we issued an additional million in aggregate principal amount of the notes 
the net proceeds  before expenses  were approximately million  and were used to pay down our revolving facility 
this million issuance contains the same provisions and terms as the million issuance 
the notes are unsecured obligations that rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness  mature on august  and are redeemable at our option after august  the redemption premiums for the twelve month periods beginning august of the years  and are  and  respectively 
in addition  up to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes may be redeemed on or before august  with net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings 
our obligations under the notes are guaranteed by our operating domestic subsidiaries 
convertible senior subordinated notes on may   we issued million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes the convertibles with net proceeds  before expenses  of approximately million 
the net proceeds were used to repay a portion of the amounts outstanding under our revolving facility 
the convertibles are unsecured obligations that rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness  mature on may   and are redeemable at our option after may  our obligations under the convertibles are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries 
the convertibles are convertible into shares of class a common stock  at the option of the holder  if as of the last day of the preceding fiscal quarter  the closing sale price of our class a common stock for at least trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of such preceding fiscal quarter is more than of the conversion price per share of class a common stock on the last day of such preceding fiscal quarter 
if this condition is satisfied  then the convertibles will be convertible at any time  at the option of the holder  through maturity 
the initial conversion price per share is  which is subject to adjustment for certain distributions on  or changes in our class a common stock  if any  prior to the conversion date 
in addition  on or before may   a holder also may convert their convertibles into shares of our class a common stock at any time after a consecutive trading day period in which the average of the trading day prices for the convertibles for that trading day period is less than of the average conversion value for the convertibles during that period 
the conversion value is equal to the product of the closing sale price for our class a common stock on a given day multiplied by the then current conversion rate  which is the number of shares of class a common stock into which each  principal amount of convertibles is then convertible 
none of the conversion features were triggered in 
table of contents notes payable to a finance company three notes payable totaling million in aggregate principal were assumed with the purchase of certain dealerships during the second quarter of the assumed notes 
the assumed notes bear interest rates from to with a weighted average of  have a combined monthly principal and interest payment of million  mature november  through september  and are collateralized by letters of credit 
we recorded the assumed notes at fair value using an interest rate of 
the interest rate used to calculate the fair value was based on a quoted market price for notes with similar terms as of the date of assumption 
as a result of calculating the fair value  a premium of million was recorded that will be amortized over the lives of the assumed notes 
although the assumed notes allow for prepayment  the penalties and fees are disproportionately burdensome relative to the assumed notes principal balance 
therefore  we do not currently intend to prepay the assumed notes 
the mortgage facility we have a revolving real estate and construction the construction loan and mortgage refinancing the permanent loan line of credit with toyota credit collectively  the mortgage facility 
under the construction loan  our dealership development subsidiaries can borrow up to million to finance land acquisition and dealership construction costs 
advances can be made under the construction loan until november all advances will mature on december   bear interest at percentage points above libor and are secured by our guarantee and a lien on all of the borrowing subsidiaries real estate and other assets 
under the permanent loan  we can refinance up to million in advances under the construction loan once the projects are completed and can finance real estate acquisition costs to the extent these costs were not previously financed under the construction loan 
advances can be made under the permanent loan until december all advances under the permanent loan mature on december   bear interest at above libor and are secured by the same collateral given under the construction loan 
the mortgage facility allows us to borrow up to million in the aggregate under the construction loan and the permanent loan 
the mortgage facility is not cross collateralized with the revolving facility  however  a default under one will cause a default under the other 
borrowings under the mortgage facility were repaid during we do not currently intend to borrow on the construction and permanent loans in the future 
we were in compliance with all of the restrictive and financial covenants on all of our floor plan and long term debt facilities at december  acquisitions and dispositions during  we acquired franchises for a combined purchase price of million in cash 
the cash utilized for these acquisitions was financed by cash generated from our existing operations and by borrowings under our revolving facility 
during  we disposed of or terminated franchises 
these disposals generated cash of million 
we have entered into agreements to purchase six franchises 
the acquisitions of the six franchises are expected to close over the course of and will be paid for in cash 
the estimated purchase price for these franchises including goodwill and purchased assets net of notes payable floor plan advances is million 
sale leaseback transactions in an effort to generate additional cash flow  we typically seek to structure our operations to minimize the ownership of real property 
as a result  facilities either constructed by us or obtained in acquisitions are typically sold to third parties in sale leaseback transactions 
the resulting leases generally have initial terms of years and include a series of five year renewal options 
we have no continuing obligations under these arrangements other than lease payments 
the majority of our sale leaseback transactions are completed with cars 
in  we sold million in dealership property and equipment in sale leaseback transactions 
there were no material gains or losses on these sales 

table of contents capital expenditures our capital expenditures include the construction of new dealerships and collision repair centers  building improvements and equipment purchased for use in our dealerships 
capital expenditures in were approximately million  of which approximately million related to the construction of new dealerships and collision repair centers and real estate acquired in connection with such construction 
once completed  these new dealerships and collision repair centers are generally sold in sale leaseback transactions 
capital expenditures incurred during expected to be sold within a year or sold in in sale leaseback transactions were million 
we do not expect any significant gains or losses from these sales 
as of december   commitments for facilities construction projects totaled approximately million 
we expect million of this amount to be financed through future sale leaseback transactions 
stock repurchase program our board of directors has authorized us to expend up to million to repurchase shares of our class a common stock or redeem securities convertible into class a common stock 
in  we repurchased  shares for approximately million which was somewhat offset by proceeds received from the exercise of stock options under stock compensation plans of million 
as of december  we had million remaining under our board authorization 
dividends our board of directors approved four quarterly cash dividends totaling per share during on february  our board of directors approved a dividend of per share for shareholders of record on march  that will be paid on april  we intend to pay dividends in the future based on available cash flows  covenant compliance and other factors 
cash flows since the majority of our inventories are financed through floor plan notes payable and a significant portion of our receivables represent contracts in transit which are typically funded within ten days of the sale of the vehicle  we are not required to make significant investments in working capital that would negatively impact our operating cash flows 
therefore  in and our operating cash flows have approximated net income adjusted for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  gains and losses on the retirement of debt  deferred taxes and the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
in  we focused our efforts on working capital management and applying excess cash against the revolving facility 
as a result of this working capital management and lower fourth quarter tax payments  cash flows from operations in of exceeded comparative amounts 
cash used for investing activities in was million  the majority of which was related to dealership acquisitions and capital expenditures on construction in progress projects offset by proceeds received from dealership dispositions and the sales of property and equipment 
net cash used in financing activities was million and primarily related to payments on our revolving facility  stock repurchases and dividend payments 
guarantees in accordance with the terms of our operating lease agreements  our dealership subsidiaries  acting as lessees  generally agree to indemnify the lessor from certain exposure arising as a result of the use of the leased premises  including environmental exposure and repairs to leased property upon termination of the lease 
in addition  we have generally agreed to indemnify the lessor in the event of a breach of the lease by the lessee 

table of contents in connection with franchise dispositions  certain of our dealership subsidiaries have assigned or sublet to the buyer their interests in real property leases associated with such dealerships 
in general  the subsidiaries retain responsibility for the performance of certain obligations under such leases  including rent payments and repairs to leased property upon termination of the lease  to the extent that the assignee or sublessee does not perform 
the total estimated rent payments remaining under such leases as of december  was approximately million 
however  in accordance with the terms of the assignment and sublease agreements  the assignees and sublessees have generally agreed to indemnify sonic and its subsidiaries in the event of non performance 
additionally  in connection with certain dispositions  we have obtained indemnifications from the parent company or owners of these assignees and sublessees in the event of non performance 
in accordance with the terms of agreements entered into for the sale of our franchises  we generally agree to indemnify the buyer from certain exposure and costs arising subsequent to the date of sale  including environmental exposure and exposure resulting from the breach of representations or warranties made in accordance with the agreement 
while our exposure with respect to environmental remediation and repairs is difficult to quantify  we estimate our maximum exposure associated with these general indemnifications was approximately million at december  these indemnifications generally expire within a period of one to three years following the date of sale 
the estimated fair value of these indemnifications was not material 
we expect the value of these various guarantees to continue to increase as we dispose of additional franchises 
future liquidity outlook our future obligations are as follows amounts in thousands thereafter total floorplan financing long term debt operating leases construction contracts other purchase obligations acquisition purchase commitments total obligations do not include interest payments 
certain amounts are redeemable at our option see preceeding discussion regarding long term debt and credit facilities but have been classified in this schedule according to contractual maturity 
amount represents estimated purchase price of tangible and intangible assets net of notes payable floor plan advances 
we believe our best source of liquidity for future growth remains cash flows generated from operations combined with our availability of borrowings under our floor plan facilities or any replacements thereof and our revolving facility 
though uncertainties in the economic environment as well as uncertainties associated with geopolitical conflicts may affect our ability to generate cash from operations  we expect to generate more than sufficient cash flow to fund our debt service and working capital requirements and any seasonal operating requirements  including our currently anticipated internal growth for our existing businesses  for the foreseeable future 
once these needs are met  we may use remaining cash flow to support our acquisition strategy or repurchase shares of our class a common stock or publicly traded debt securities  as market conditions warrant 
seasonality our operations are subject to seasonal variations 
the first and fourth quarters generally contribute less revenue and operating profits than the second and third quarters 
parts and service demand remains more stable throughout the year 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our variable rate floor plan facilities  revolving facility borrowings and other variable rate notes expose us to risks caused by fluctuations in the applicable interest rates 
the total outstanding balance of such variable instruments after considering the effect of our interest rate swaps see below was approximately  million at december  and approximately  million at december  a change of basis points in the underlying interest rate would have caused a change in interest expense of approximately million in and approximately million in of the total change in interest expense  approximately million in and approximately million in would have resulted from the floor plan notes facilities 
our exposure with respect to floor plan facilities is mitigated by floor plan assistance payments received from manufacturers that are generally based on rates similar to those incurred under our floor plan financing arrangements 
these payments are capitalized as inventory and charged against cost of sales when the associated inventory is sold 
during and  the amounts we recognized from manufacturer floor plan assistance for both continuing and discontinued franchises exceeded our floor plan interest expense by approximately million and million  respectively 
a change in interest rates of basis points would have had an estimated impact on floor plan assistance of approximately million in and million in should the amount of floor plan assistance payments received from manufacturers decrease from the current levels  it is likely that this decrease could adversely affect our future operating results to the extent that this decrease is not recaptured in prices charged to new vehicle customers 
in addition to our variable rate debt  we also have lease agreements on a portion of our dealership facilities where the monthly lease payment fluctuates based on libor interest rates 
many of our lease agreements have interest rate floors whereby our lease expense would not fluctuate significantly in periods when libor is relatively low 
in order to reduce our exposure to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates  we have two separate interest rate swap agreements the fixed swaps to effectively convert a portion of our libor based variable rate debt to a fixed rate 
the first swap agreement matured october  and had a notional principal amount of million 
the second swap agreement will mature june  and has a notional principal of million 
under the terms of the first swap agreement  we received interest payments on the notional amount at a rate equal to the one month libor rate  adjusted monthly  and made interest payments at a fixed rate of 
under the terms of the second swap agreement  we receive interest payments on the notional amount at a rate equal to the one month libor rate  adjusted monthly  and make interest payments at a fixed rate of 
in  we entered into five separate interest rate swaps totaling million collectively  the variable swaps to effectively convert a portion of our fixed rate debt to a libor based variable rate debt 
under the variable swaps agreements  we receive on the respective notional amounts and pay interest payments on the respective notional amounts at a rate equal to the six month libor plus a spread ranging from to with a weighted average spread of 
the variable swaps expire on august

although we purchase our inventories in us dollars  our business is subject to foreign exchange rate risk which may influence automobile manufacturers ability to provide their products at competitive prices in the united states 
to the extent that we cannot recapture this volatility in prices charged to customers or if this volatility negatively impacts consumer demand for our products  this volatility could adversely affect our future operating results
