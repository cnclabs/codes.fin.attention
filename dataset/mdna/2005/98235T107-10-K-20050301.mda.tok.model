at the end of  we have exclusive independent distributors and sales associates in the us  and approximately sales representatives internationally who are employed through a combination of our stocking distribution partners and direct sales offices 
company history 
we were incorporated in november as a delaware corporation  and had no operations until december   when we were reorganized by an investment group through the acquisition of our predecessor company  wright medical technology  inc this transaction represented a recapitalization of our predecessor company and the inception of wright in its present form 
on december   we acquired cremascoli ortho holding  sa  an orthopaedic medical device company headquartered in toulon  france 
in  we completed our ipo of  shares of common stock  which generated million in net proceeds 
in  we completed a secondary offering of  shares of common stock which generated million in net proceeds 
principal products 
we primarily sell reconstructive joint devices and biologics products 
our reconstructive joint device sales are derived from three primary product lines knees  hips and extremities 
our biologics sales 
table of contents encompass a broad portfolio of products designed to stimulate and augment the natural regenerative capabilities of the human body 
we also sell various orthopaedic products not considered to be part of our knee  hip  extremity or biologics product lines 
our hip joint reconstruction product portfolio provides offerings in the areas of bone conserving implants  total hip reconstruction  revision replacement implants  and limb preservation 
our hip joint products include the conserve family of products  the profemur hip system  the lineage acetabular system  the anca fit hip system  and the perfecta hip system 
in  the fda granted us approval to market our ceramic on ceramic bearing as part of the lineage acetabular system  placing us among the first companies to market ceramic on ceramic total hip solutions in the us our biologics products focus on biological musculoskeletal repair and include synthetic and human tissue based materials 
our principal biologics products include the allomatrix line of injectable tissue based bone graft substitutes  the graftjacket tissue repair and containment membranes  the osteoset synthetic bone graft substitute  the miig family of minimally invasive injectable synthetic bone grafts  and in our international markets  the adcon gel anti adhesion product

our knee reconstruction products position us well in the areas of total knee reconstruction  revision replacement implants  and limb preservation products 
our principal knee products include the advance knee system and the advance unicompartmental knee system 
significant business developments 
the significant growth of our business that we experienced in continued into  with considerable expansion of all of our principal product line sales 
net sales grew in  totaling million  compared to million in our focus on the high growth sectors of the orthopaedic industry  such as advanced bearing surfaces  modular necks and bone conserving implants within the hip market and the integration of biologics products into reconstructive joint procedures and other orthopaedic applications  combined with new product development focused on specific surgical issues  continues to drive our success 
our hip and biologics product lines contributed significantly to our performance in  achieving and growth rates  respectively 
a significant development in the hip market over the past two years has been advances in bearing surfaces  including ceramic on ceramic 
in  the fda granted us approval to market our ceramic on ceramic bearing as part of the lineage acetabular system  placing us among the first companies to market ceramic on ceramic total hip solutions in the us while we encountered additional competition in the ceramic on ceramic hip market in  we sustained a considerable growth rate throughout the year  ending with an overall growth rate of 
we anticipate further competition in the ceramic on ceramic hip market in  however  we believe that our full continuum of hip products will position us for continued success in in march  our pma application for our conserve plus hip system was accepted for filing by the fda 
our conserve plus resurfacing implant is available outside the us and is pending fda clearance for the us market 
with our conserve plus resurfacing implant  the surface of the patient s femoral head and the acetabular surface are replaced with minimal bone loss 
in may  we received a warning letter from the fda regarding the conserve plus resurfacing implant investigational device exemption 
we responded in june  addressing the issues cited in the warning letter  and in reply  the fda informed us that our corrective actions had been accepted 
we continue to work with the fda as it reviews this pma 
in march  we received marketing clearance from the fda for our allomatrix injectable putty 
this clearance was obtained based on satisfaction of the fda s requirements pursuant to a k premarket notification process that began with our submission of a k in march this submission was in response to the fda s 
table of contents clarification to all allograft putty providers  including us  that such products should be regulated under the medical device premarket notification provisions of the food  drug  and cosmetic act 
further  in july  we received marketing clearance from the fda for our allomatrix c  allomatrix custom and allomatrix dr putty products following our submission of a k in april  completing the clearance process for our entire allomatrix family of products 
in august  we introduced our micronail intramedullary wrist fracture repair system  a next generation  minimally invasive solution that provides immediate fracture stabilization utilizing fixed angle locking screws 
the micronail system is targeted to become a viable alternative for many wrist fracture patients currently treated with a cast and is the only one of its kind on the market 
in september  we announced a voluntary market withdrawal of a limited number of metal acetabular hip cups intended for use in our conserve hip systems  as these components may not have met our product specifications due to the presence of a small ridge on the cup s non articulating inside bearing surface 
we notified the fda of this action and removed from commercial availability all unused components covered by the market withdrawal 
in connection with this market withdrawal  we incurred approximately  of expenses for probable costs related to the market withdrawal 
we did not experience any supply issues as a result of this market withdrawal  and this market withdrawal has not had a significant impact on our sales 
further discussion of our voluntary market withdrawal is included in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
during the fourth quarter of  we incurred approximately million of costs as a result of the transition from certain of our foot and ankle implant offerings to an innovative  next generation line of internally developed products  collectively referred to as the charlotte foot and ankle system  replacing products supplied by a third party vendor pursuant to a distribution agreement that expired in the first quarter of these charges resulted from the write down of our distributed foot and ankle implant inventory to its estimated net realizable value and accelerated depreciation on the related surgical instrumentation 
we launched our charlotte foot and ankle system in mid february significant industry factors 
our industry is impacted by numerous competitive  regulatory and other significant factors 
the growth of our business relies on our ability to continue to develop new products and innovative technologies  obtain regulatory clearance and compliance for our products  protect the proprietary technology of our products and our manufacturing processes  manufacture our products cost effectively  respond to competitive pressures specific to each of our geographic markets  including our ability to enforce non compete agreements  and successfully market and distribute our products in a profitable manner 
we  and the entire industry  are subject to extensive governmental regulation  primarily by the fda 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
additionally  our industry is highly competitive and our success is dependent on our ability to compete successfully against our competitors 
we devote significant resources to assessing and analyzing competitive  regulatory and economic risks and opportunities 
a detailed discussion of these and other factors is provided under the heading  factors affecting future operating results  within md a 
net sales and expense components net sales 
we derive our net sales primarily from the sale of reconstructive joint devices and biologics products 
an overview of our principal product lines is provided under the heading  executive overview  within md a 
cost of sales 
our cost of sales consists primarily of direct labor  allocated manufacturing overhead  raw materials and components  charges incurred for excess and obsolete inventories  royalty expenses associated with licensing technologies used in our products or processes  and certain other period expenses 
selling  general and administrative 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  sales commissions  royalty and consulting expenses associated with our medical advisors  marketing costs  facility costs  legal costs  other general business and administrative expenses  and depreciation expense associated with surgical instruments required by surgeons to use when implanting our products 
research and development 
research and development expense includes costs associated with the design  development  testing  deployment  enhancement and regulatory approval of our products 

table of contents amortization of intangible assets 
our intangible assets consist of purchased intangibles principally related to completed technology  distribution channels and trademarks primarily resulting from our acquisition of cremascoli  as well as distribution and product licenses 
we amortize intangible assets over periods ranging from to years 
stock based expense 
we incur stock based expenses as a result of the amortization of non cash deferred compensation that is recorded in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
this deferred compensation resulted following the issuance of stock options to employees and the sale of equity securities when the estimated fair value of the securities was deemed  for financial reporting purposes  to have exceeded their respective exercise or sales price 
the substantial majority of our stock based expense relates to the issuance of shares and options prior to the completion of our ipo in additionally  for stock based incentives granted to consultants  we defer and amortize the fair value of such grants as calculated pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
deferred compensation is amortized on a straight line basis over the respective vesting periods of the stock based incentives  which is generally four years  and we immediately expense all stock based compensation associated with the issuance of equity where no vesting restrictions apply 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net  consists primarily of interest on borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facility and certain of our factoring agreements  as well as non cash expenses associated with the amortization of deferred financing costs resulting from the origination of our senior credit facility 
these expenses are offset by income earned on our invested cash balances 
provision for income taxes 
we record provisions for income taxes on earnings generated by both our domestic and international operations 
historically  our effective tax rates have varied from our statutory tax rates primarily due to research and development credits and changes in estimates related to our valuation allowances recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
results of operations introduction 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts in thousands and as percentages of net sales year ended december  of of of amount sales amount sales amount sales net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development amortization of intangible assets stock based expense acquired in process research and development costs arbitration settlement award total operating expenses operating income interest expense  net other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income

net sales growth in was attributable to strong demand across all of our principal products lines  with significant contributions from hips and biologics which grew by and  respectively  and solid growth in our extremity and knee business which grew by and  respectively 
geographically  our domestic net sales totaled million in and million in  representing approximately of total net sales in both years and growth of 
our international net sales totaled million in  a increase as compared to net sales of million in our international net sales include a favorable currency impact of approximately million  principally resulting from the performance of the euro against the us dollar 
our international growth was primarily driven by increased sales in our european and asian markets  with expansion across all product lines 

table of contents our hip product sales totaled million in  representing a increase 
growth in our hip business in is attributable to continued success in domestic markets  where total hip procedures grew by  driven by our conserve total implant with bfh technology and our profemur line of primary stems featuring our innovative neck modularity 
additionally  a favorable shift in our sales mix to premium priced hard bearing procedures  which includes our ceramic on ceramic and metal on metal products  contributed to our domestic growth 
our percentage of hard bearing surgeries grew from of total domestic hip surgeries in to in in our international markets  unit sales growth of our conserve plus resurfacing implant and a favorable currency impact of million both impacted the year over year sales increase 
we believe that our hip product portfolio  which focuses on innovative solutions including bone conserving implants  advanced bearing surfaces and modular neck technology  will position us for continued success in sales of our biologics products in totaled million  representing an increase of 
the growth of our biologics business in is primarily attributable to the continued favorable performance  in domestic markets  of our graftjacket tissue repair and containment membranes combined with the performance of our adcon gel product in international markets 
domestically  total biologics procedures grew by  as significant growth of our graftjacket product line  combined with growth of our osteoset family of products and our miig minimally invasive injectable graft family of products  was offset by declines in our dbm demineralized bone matrix containing allomatrix family of products 
during  competitive pressures in the mature market for dbm containing products had a negative impact on the performance of our allomatrix products 
from an international perspective  unit sales growth of our adcon gel product and a favorable currency impact of approximately  contributed to our biologics growth in as we move into  significant investment in high performance synthetic bone graft substitutes should enable us to take advantage of longer term opportunities within the trauma and spine segments of the orthopaedic market 
our extremity product sales increased to million in  representing growth of over increased unit sales of our higher priced extremity products  such as our foot and ankle products and our evolve modular radial head system  combined with pricing increases across our entire extremity product platform  were the most significant factors contributing to our year over year growth 
for  we anticipate that our extremity line of business will continue to benefit from our evolve modular radial head system  as well as the launch of our micronail system and our mid february launch of our charlotte foot and ankle system  a next generation line of internally developed foot and ankle products 
sales of our knee products totaled million in  representing growth of 
our domestic knee performance is attributable to a combination of increased unit sales and increased prices 
our international knee growth is attributable to a combination of increased unit sales and a favorable currency impact of approximately million 
in the latter half of  we introduced our minimally invasive surgical instrumentation for knee procedures to certain key customers 
as we move into  we anticipate further success in our knee product line as we are able to more fully penetrate the us market with this instrumentation 
cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in approximately percentage points of this increase is attributable to million of costs incurred during the fourth quarter of to write down certain foot and ankle implant inventory to its net realizable value as a result of the transition of this product line to our charlotte foot and ankle system 
the remaining increase as a percentage of sales is primarily attributable to higher levels of charges incurred for excess and obsolete inventories 
our cost of sales and corresponding gross profit percentages can be expected to fluctuate in future periods depending upon changes in our product sales mix and prices  distribution channels and geographies  manufacturing yields  period expenses and levels of production volume 
selling  general and administrative 
our selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled in  a percentage point decrease from in this decrease is attributable to decreased royalty expenses as a percentage of net sales  decreased commission expense as a percentage of net sales due to shifts in our geographic sales mix to higher levels of international sales which generally incur a lower commission rate  and our ability to control other discretionary costs while continuing to significantly expand our business 
these decreases were offset by approximately million of incremental costs related to corporate governance  approximately  resulting from our limited market withdrawal of certain conserve hip 
table of contents components  approximately  of accelerated depreciation expense related to surgical instrumentation for certain foot and ankle products that will be transitioned out of our product offerings during the first quarter of  and additional legal costs related to the on going transition of certain management and distribution personnel in southern europe 
we anticipate that our selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales will continue to decrease in future periods as we manage the growth of our existing infrastructure while continuing to expand our business 
during the first half of  we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to be impacted by additional costs associated with the transition of certain management and distribution personnel in southern europe and additional accelerated depreciation on surgical instrumentation 
additionally  selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars to the extent that any additional growth in net sales results in increases in sales commissions and royalty expense associated with those sales 
research and development 
our investment in research and development activities represented approximately of net sales in  as compared to in in absolute dollars  research and development expenditures increased to million in from million in this increase can be attributed to increased spending on product development and clinical evaluations for pre market products and products already on the market 
our key product launches in included our osteoset dbm pellets  our advance double high knee design  our micronail intramedullary distal radius implant  our odyssey tissue preserving initiative for hip and knee procedures  and our profemur tapered stem total hip system 
for  we anticipate that our research and development expenditures as a percentage of net sales will be in the range of to 
as our business continues to grow  we expect our research and development expenditures to increase in absolute dollars  and may increase as a percentage of net sales as we continue to increase our investment in product development initiatives and clinical studies 
amortization of intangible assets 
our amortization expense during was consistent with  totaling million in as compared to million in based on the intangible assets held at december   we expect to amortize approximately million in  million in  million in  million in and million in stock based expense 
we recognized million and million of stock based expense during and  respectively  primarily resulting from the amortization of our deferred compensation 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which requires the recognition of compensation expense for the fair value of share based transactions 
the fair value must be determined as of the date of grant using a valuation model such as black scholes or a lattice model 
the resulting compensation expense will be recognized over the service period 
we will adopt sfas no 
r effective july  we anticipate that we will record material amounts of incremental non cash stock based expense in future periods following the adoption of sfas no 
r 
however  the exact amount cannot be determined until management s evaluation of sfas no 
r is complete and an appropriate valuation model has been selected and applied to determine the fair value of our stock options outstanding 
the effect of expensing stock options on our historical results of operations using the black scholes model is presented in the table in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
in process research and development cost 
upon consummation of our acquisition of certain adcon gel technology assets from gliatech inc in march  we immediately recognized as expense approximately million in costs representing the estimated fair value of acquired in process research and development iprd that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
we engaged an independent third party to conduct a valuation of the intangible assets acquired 
the value was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired iprd into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from this project  and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
an additional discount was applied to take into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development and commercialization of the acquired iprd 
the resulting net cash flows from the project were based on our 
table of contents management s best estimates of revenue  cost of sales  research and development costs  selling  general and administrative costs  and income taxes from the project 
a summary of the estimates used to calculate the net cash flows for the project is as follows year net cash in flows discount rate including expected to factor to account for project begin uncertainty of success acquired iprd adcon gel adcon gel products are designed to reduce adhesion formation following lumbar spine adcon l gel and peripheral tendon nerve adcon t n gel procedures  thus reducing or eliminating post operative pain 
both adcon l gel and adcon t n gel are commercially available internationally  but are currently not available for sale in the us our adcon l gel product had previously received regulatory clearance from the fda in in  the fda determined that the provisions of its application integrity policy aip would be applied to gliatech due to violations of good clinical practices in the conduct  analysis  and reporting of data specific to the us clinical study of adcon l gel 
in  the fda lifted the aip status of gliatech  which subsequently allowed us  as the new owner of the technology  to present the fda with clinical data intended to support the return of adcon l gel to the us market 
since the submission of our adcon l gel pma application to the fda in december  we have been working to satisfy additional requirements necessary to obtain fda approval to market adcon l gel in the us we will be required to conduct a separate clinical study to enter the us market with adcon t n gel 
our original estimate for receipt of net cash flows associated with this project was in  however  we now anticipate that adcon l gel will be available for sale in the us market no sooner than this delay in the estimated completion date has not had a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
we expect to pursue necessary clinical studies to allow fda approval for additional applications outside of the spine  such as the peripheral tendon nerve 
we are unable to estimate at this time when such additional fda approvals would occur 
we anticipate that portions of our existing cash will be used to continue to develop the acquired iprd into commercially viable products 
this development consists primarily of the completion of all clinical evaluation testing activities and regulatory approvals that are necessary to establish the safety and efficacy of the products and to market them in the us bringing the acquired iprd to market also includes testing the products for compatibility and interoperability with commercially viable products 
due to the history of the adcon gel products with the fda  we are unable to estimate the extent of research and development activities that will be necessary to develop these products into commercially viable products 
we are continuously monitoring our research and development projects 
we believe that the assumptions used in the valuation of acquired iprd represent a reasonably reliable estimate of the future benefits attributable to the acquired iprd 
no assurance can be given that actual results will not deviate from those assumptions in future periods 
interest expense  net 
our interest expense  net  consists primarily of interest on borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facility and certain of our factoring agreements and is partially offset by interest income of approximately  and  in and  respectively  from our invested cash balances 
our net interest expense also includes non cash expense associated with the amortization of deferred financing costs resulting from the origination of our senior credit facility of approximately  during both and other income  net 
other income  net  primarily consists of gains and losses resulting from foreign currency fluctuations  offset in the second half of by the impact of gains and losses resulting from certain foreign currency forward contracts 
these contracts are discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
primarily as a result of these forward contracts  our other income  net  decreased from million in to a nominal amount in 
table of contents provision for income taxes 
we recorded tax provisions of million and million in and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for both and was approximately  which reflects the impact of certain tax saving initiatives  including research and development credits and changes in estimates related to the valuation allowances recorded against our deferred tax assets 
during  the american jobs creation act of jobs creation act was signed into law 
beginning in  the jobs creation act includes relief for domestic manufacturers by providing a tax deduction up to of the lesser of qualified production activities income or taxable income 
in addition  the jobs creation act also provides for a one time tax deduction of of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated 
based on our assessment of the repatriation deduction  we have determined to continue our current policy of permanently reinvesting all foreign earnings 
with respect to the tax deduction provided for domestic manufacturers  we are in the process of evaluating the potential impact of this portion of the jobs creation act to our business 
the transition issues related to this deduction are complex and little interpretative guidance has been issued to date 
accordingly  management has not determined  what  if any  the impact of this tax deduction will have to on our effective tax rate in future periods 
excluding any favorable impact of the jobs creation act  for  we expect our effective tax rate to increase from to a range of to  however  the actual rate will depend on a number of factors  including the amount of pre tax income by jurisdiction  any incremental tax saving initiatives that might be identified and implemented and the ultimate impact  if any  of the jobs creation act 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  net sales 
our net sales grew in  totaling million 
this was attributable to the success of our biologics and extremity product lines  as well as significant growth in our hip product line 
geographically  our domestic net sales totaled million in and million in  representing of total net sales in both years and growth of 
our international net sales totaled million in  increasing by over net sales of million in our international net sales included a favorable currency impact of approximately million  principally resulting from the performance of the euro against the us dollar  when compared to our european and japanese operations were the significant drivers of our sales growth in our international operations in from a product line perspective  our net sales growth for was attributable to increases in sales across all of our principal product lines 
for  we experienced growth of   and  in our hip  biologics  extremity  and knee product lines  respectively 
our most significant growth drivers in were our hip and biologics product lines 
during  our hip sales growth was attributable primarily to demand for our higher priced conserve total implant with bfh technology  as well as our lineage acetabular system and our profemur stem products  both of which were positively influenced by the launch of our lineage ceramic on ceramic hip system in the first quarter our biologics sales growth of in was primarily the result of strong growth across all of our biologics product offerings 
cost of sales 
our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly to in from in this decrease is primarily a result of our ability to manage certain of our fixed manufacturing costs while our business significantly expanded during operating expenses 
our total operating expenses increased  as a percentage of net sales  by percentage points to in operating expenses include selling  general and administrative expenses  research and development expenses  amortization of intangibles  and stock based expenses 
additionally  operating expenses included approximately million of acquired iprd costs in and the favorable impact of our million arbitration settlement award in these two items were the primary drivers of the increase in operating expenses 
these amounts were partially offset by favorable selling  general and administrative expenses  resulting from our ability to control our discretionary spending while significantly growing our business  and reductions in amortization of intangible assets 

table of contents provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate for was approximately as compared to an effective tax rate of for our effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the reduction of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  which resulted in an million non cash benefit to our provision for income taxes 
excluding this benefit  our effective tax rate for would have been approximately 
the decrease in our effective tax rate in  excluding this benefit  reflected the effect of certain tax savings initiatives that were implemented in seasonal nature of business our business is seasonal in nature 
we traditionally experience lower sales volumes in the third quarter months than throughout the rest of the year as a result of the european holiday schedule during the summer months 
in addition  our first quarter selling  general and administrative expenses include additional expenses that we incur in connection with the annual meeting held by the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons 
this meeting  which is the largest orthopaedic meeting in the world  features the presentation of scientific papers and instructional courses for orthopaedic surgeons 
during this day event  we display our most recent and innovative products for these surgeons 
liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain liquidity measures in thousands as of december  cash and cash equivalents working capital line of credit availability our cash and cash equivalents increased during by million  compared to an increase of million in our increase in cash and cash equivalents is primarily attributable to the generation of million of cash from operating activities during  partially offset by routine capital expenditures 
our increase in cash and cash equivalents and working capital is primarily attributable to the generation of million of cash from operating activities during  partially offset by capital expenditures and the acquisition of adcon gel technology assets 
operating activities 
operating cash flow in benefited from the profitability of our business and working capital management  which resulted primarily from improved collection of our outstanding receivables during the improvement in our collections was offset by increased investments in new product inventory during in order to prepare for anticipated product launches  as well as an increase of approximately million in cash tax payments 
operating cash flow in benefited from the profitability of our business  as well as improved inventory management 
cash generated from operating activities in totaled approximately million and included the favorable million arbitration settlement award  which was partially offset by significant investments in new product inventory investing activities 
our capital expenditures totaled approximately million in  million in  and million in our industry is capital intensive  particularly as it relates to surgical instrumentation 
historically  our capital expenditures have consisted of purchased manufacturing equipment  research and testing equipment  computer systems  office furniture and equipment  and surgical instruments 
we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately million in total for for routine capital expenditures 
the increase in anticipated capital spending from is expected to be primarily attributable to increased investments in surgical instrumentation for new products 
furthermore  as mentioned under the heading  properties  in item of this report  we are evaluating our long term facility needs in the us in response to our anticipated growth 
we cannot estimate the amount of capital spending  if any  that will be incurred in should we expand or construct new facilities 

table of contents in  in addition to our routine capital expenditures  we paid million to complete the purchase of iprd  tangible assets  and intangible assets from gliatech  which were primarily related to the adcon gel technology 
we are continuously evaluating opportunities to purchase technology and other forms of intellectual property and are  therefore  unable to predict the timing of future purchases 
financing activities 
during  we made million in scheduled payments related to borrowings under our senior credit facility and approximately million in payments related to our long term capital leases 
in the fourth quarter of  our operating subsidiary in italy began factoring portions of its accounts receivable balances under a new agreement  which is considered a financing transaction for financial reporting purposes 
the cash proceeds received from this factoring agreement  net of the amount of factored receivables collected  are reflected as cash flow from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
in  the net activity under this agreement was consistent as the amount of cash received approximated the receivables collected 
we recorded an obligation of million and million for the amount of receivables factored under this agreement as of december  and  respectively  which is included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
the proceeds received under the agreement in and totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
additionally  we received cash proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options and warrants during in  our debt payments will increase to million based on the terms of our senior credit facility 
additionally  we will make continued payments under our long term capital leases  including interest  of approximately million 
we anticipate that our factoring program in italy will continue  however  the level and extent of the amounts factored under the agreement and the ultimate amount of proceeds received under the program cannot be predicted 
therefore  we are unable to predict the ultimate amount of proceeds that will be received in related to this factoring agreement 
contractual cash obligations 
at december   we had contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments as follows in thousands payments due by periods after total amounts reflected in balance sheet notes payable capital lease obligations amounts not reflected in balance sheet operating leases purchase obligations royalty and consulting agreements total contractual cash obligations payments include amounts representing interest our senior credit facility  which we entered into in august  has a five year term and consists of million in term loans  with an unpaid balance of approximately million at december   and a revolving loan facility of up to million 
borrowings under the senior credit facility are guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries and collateralized by all of the assets of wright medical technology  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary 
the credit facility contains customary covenants including  among other things  restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends  prepay debt  incur additional debt and sell assets 
the credit facility also requires us to maintain certain financial covenants  including a specified consolidated leverage or debt to equity ratio and a specified consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 
in the event that we violate any covenants  we could be required to repay the remaining balance of the debt 
additionally  should we be required to repay the loan before its scheduled maturity  we would incur a charge to operating income for unamortized financing costs 
at our option  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest either at a rate equal to a fixed base rate plus a spread of 
to or at a rate equal to an adjusted libor plus a spread of to  depending on our consolidated leverage ratio  with a current annual rate of 

table of contents the amounts reflected in the table above for capital lease obligations represent future minimum lease payments under our capital lease agreements which are primarily for certain property and equipment 
the present value of the minimum lease payments are recorded in our balance sheet at december  the minimum lease payments related to these leases are discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report 
the amounts reflected in the table above for operating leases represent future minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases primarily for certain equipment and office space 
portions of these payments are denominated in foreign currencies and were translated in the table above based on their respective us dollar exchange rates at december  these future payments are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  our operating leases are not recognized in our consolidated balance sheet  however  the minimum lease payments related to these agreements are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report 
our purchase obligations reflected in the table above consist of minimum purchase obligations related to certain supply agreements 
the royalty and consulting agreements in the above table represent minimum payments to consultants that are contingent upon future services 
portions of these payments are denominated in foreign currencies and were translated in the table above based on their respective us dollar exchange rates at december  these future payments are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our purchase obligations and royalty and consulting agreements are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report 
in addition to the contractual cash obligations discussed above  all of our domestic sales and a portion of our international sales are subject to commissions based on net sales  and a substantial portion of our global sales are subject to other royalties earned based on product sales 
further  under our factoring agreement in italy  our liability for cash proceeds received of million discussed under the heading  financing activities  may be subject to repayment upon days notice 
none of these amounts are included in the table above 
other liquidity information 
we have funded our cash needs since through various equity and debt issuances and through cash flow from operations 
in  we completed our ipo of  shares of common stock which generated million in net proceeds 
in  we completed a secondary offering of  shares of common stock which generated million in net proceeds 
although it is difficult for us to predict our future liquidity requirements  we believe that our current cash balance of approximately million  our existing available credit line of approximately million  and our expected cash flow from our operating activities  which in totaled approximately million  will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to fund our working capital requirements and operations  permit anticipated capital expenditures in of approximately million  meet our contractual cash obligations in  and fund any potential expansion of our current facilities or the construction of new facilities 
critical accounting estimates all of our significant accounting policies and estimates are described in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report 
however  certain of our more critical accounting estimates require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions in determining the estimate 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we develop these judgments based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
different  reasonable estimates could have been used in the current period 
additionally  changes in accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
both of these factors could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents we believe that the following financial estimates are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments 
further  we believe that the items discussed below are properly recorded in the financial statements for all periods presented 
our management has discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of our most critical financial estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent auditors 
the judgments about those financial estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
those financial estimates include revenue recognition 
our revenues are generated through two types of customers  hospitals and stocking distributors  with the majority of our revenue derived from sales to hospitals 
our products are sold through a network of independent sales representatives in the us and by a combination of employee sales representatives  independent sales representatives  and stocking distributors outside the us we record revenues from sales to hospitals when the hospital takes title to the product  which is when the product is surgically implanted in a patient and a purchase order is received from the hospital 
we view the receipt of a purchase order as the evidence of customer acceptance of the product 
we record revenues from sales to our stocking distributors at the time the product is shipped to the distributor 
our stocking distributors  who sell the products to their customers  take title to the products and assume all risks of ownership 
our distributors are obligated to pay us within specified terms regardless of when  if ever  they sell the products 
in general  our distributors do not have any rights of return or exchange  however  in limited situations we have repurchase agreements with certain stocking distributors 
those certain agreements require us to repurchase a specified percentage of the inventory purchased by the distributor within a specified period of time prior to the expiration of the contract 
during those specified periods  we defer the applicable percentage of the sales 
approximately  and  of deferred revenue related to these types of agreements was recorded at december  and  respectively 
we must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
to do so  we analyze our historical experience related to product returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns 
judgment must be used and estimates made in connection with establishing the allowance for product returns in any accounting period 
our allowances for product returns of  and  are included as a reduction of accounts receivable at december  and  respectively 
should actual future returns vary significantly from our historical averages  our operating results could be affected 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we experience some credit loss on our accounts receivable and accordingly we must make estimates related to the ultimate collection of our accounts receivable 
specifically  we analyze our accounts receivable  historical bad debt experience  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the majority of our receivables are from hospitals  many of which are government funded 
accordingly  our collection history with these customers has been favorable 
historically  we have experienced minimal bad debts from our hospital customers and more significant bad debts from certain international distributors  typically as a result of specific financial difficulty or geo political factors 
in and  the increases in our accounts receivable balance have related almost exclusively to our hospital customers 
as the historical bad debt experience with this class of customer is minimal  our allowance has not increased proportionately to the increase in our accounts receivable balance 
we write off receivables when we determine that the receivable is uncollectible  typically upon customer bankruptcy or the customer s non response to collection efforts 
we believe that the amount included in our allowance for doubtful accounts has been a historically accurate estimate of the amount of accounts receivable that are ultimately collected 
while we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate  the financial condition of our customers and the geo political factors that impact reimbursement under individual countries healthcare systems can change rapidly and as such  additional allowances may be required in future periods 
our accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million  at december  and  respectively 

table of contents excess and obsolete inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or its net realizable value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand for excess and obsolete inventory and  when circumstances indicate  we incur charges to write down inventories to their net realizable value 
our review of inventory for excess and obsolete quantities is based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twenty four months 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our industry is characterized by regular new product development that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand due to cannibalization of existing products 
also  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may be required to incur charges for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if additional inventory write downs are required  we would recognize additional cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
regardless of changes in our estimates of future product demand  we do not increase the value of our inventory above its adjusted cost basis 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  significant unanticipated decreases in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
charges incurred for excess and obsolete inventory were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  charges incurred for excess and obsolete inventory included million recorded to write down certain foot and ankle implant inventory to its net realizable value as a result of our transition to our charlotte foot and ankle system 
goodwill and long lived assets 
we have approximately million of goodwill recorded as a result of acquisition of businesses 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that impairment exists 
we have two reporting units for purposes of evaluating goodwill for impairment  wright medical technology  inc wmt and wright medical europe wme 
wmt consists of our us  canadian  and japanese subsidiaries and is primarily consistent with our predecessor company prior its recapitalization 
wme consists of our european subsidiaries and is primarily consistent with the former cremascoli operations prior to its acquisition by us 
the annual evaluation of goodwill impairment requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of our reporting units using projections of future cash flows 
our estimates of future sales growth rates and operating margin can significantly affect the outcome of the impairment test 
we performed our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of and determined that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of those units and  therefore  no impairment charge was necessary 
our business is capital intensive  particularly as it relates to surgical instrumentation 
we depreciate our property  plant and equipment and amortize our intangible assets based upon our estimate of the respective asset s useful life 
our estimate of the useful life of an asset requires us to make judgments about future events  such as product life cycles  new product development  product cannibalization and technological obsolescence  as well as other competitive factors beyond our control 
we account for the impairment of long lived assets in accordance sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
accordingly  we evaluate impairments of our property  plant and equipment based upon an analysis of estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
if we determine that a change is required in the useful life of an asset  future depreciation amortization is adjusted accordingly 
alternatively  should we determine that an asset has been impaired  an adjustment would be charged to income based on its fair market value  or discounted cash flows if the fair market value is not readily determinable  reducing income in that period 
during  based on our decision to transition to a new line of internally developed foot and ankle products in the first quarter of  we reviewed for impairment our instrumentation related to foot and ankle products sold under a distribution agreement 
the projected undiscounted cash flows for these instruments exceeded the carrying value of the instruments and accordingly  no impairment charge was necessary 
however  based on our transition to a new product line in the first quarter of  we revised the estimated useful life of these instruments and recorded accelerated depreciation during the fourth quarter of of approximately  we expect to record additional accelerated depreciation of approximately  in the first quarter of 
table of contents product liability claims 
periodically  claims arise involving the use of our products 
we make provisions for claims specifically identified for which we believe the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and an estimate of the amount of loss has been developed 
we have recorded at least the minimum estimated liability related to those claims where a range of loss has been established 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the estimated liability related to our pending claims and make revisions as necessary 
future revisions in our estimates of the liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 
we maintain insurance coverage that limits the severity of any single claim as well as total amounts incurred per policy year  and we believe our insurance coverage is adequate 
we use the best information available to us in determining the level of accrued product liabilities and we believe our accruals are adequate 
during  we recorded  in product liability reserves for probable losses following our announcement of a voluntary market withdrawal of a limited number of metal acetabular hip cups intended for use in our conserve hip systems 
management developed this estimate and believes that the amount recorded is appropriate based on assumptions with respect to estimated patient claims related to the market withdrawal and the acceptance of such claims by our insurer 
the nature of a market withdrawal and the associated claims are such that the claims will occur over an extended period of time 
our estimate includes an assumption for unasserted claims based on management s industry experience with similar circumstances 
while we believe that the amount recorded related to the market withdrawal is appropriate  it is possible that changes in assumptions related to potential claims or insurance coverage could have an adverse effect on our estimate 
for the years ended december  and  operating expenses were not materially affected by our estimates of product liability claims 
our accrual for product liability claims was approximately million and  at december  and  respectively 
accounting for income taxes 
our effective tax rate is based on income by tax jurisdiction  statutory rates and tax saving initiatives available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and evaluating our tax positions 
this process includes assessing temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we establish valuation allowances when the amount of future taxable income is not likely to support the recovery of the deferred tax asset 
to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance or increase the allowance in a period  we reflect the increase as expense within the tax provision in our statement of operations 
in addition to establishing valuation allowances for deferred tax assets  we establish accruals for tax contingencies for certain tax jurisdictions  when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions may be challenged and that we may not prevail upon review 
we adjust these accruals for tax contingencies in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
our tax provision reflects the impact of establishing these accruals for tax contingencies and any subsequent adjustments 
we have recorded valuation allowances of million and million as of december  and  respectively  due to uncertainties related to our ability to realize  before expiration  some of our deferred tax assets for both us and foreign income tax purposes 
these deferred tax assets primarily consist of the carry forward of certain net operating losses and general business tax credits 
we established these valuation allowances based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to increase or decrease our valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
we have recorded accruals for tax contingencies of million and million as of december  and  respectively  for certain exposure items 
we established these accruals for tax jurisdictions where we believe that certain positions may be challenged and the likelihood of a favorable outcome upon review is less than probable 
during  we completed certain tax studies 
these studies indicated that a revision to our original estimates of the limitations on the utilization of our net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards was required 
accordingly  the completion of the studies resulted in a reduction of approximately million in the valuation allowance for these deferred tax assets as the deferred tax assets were more likely than not to be realized in the future 
additionally  these studies indicated that approximately million of tax exposure existed as a result of the tax filing positions taken with respect to these net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
based on these findings  we reclassified 
table of contents approximately million of the valuation allowance to our accruals for tax contingencies 
the remaining reduction in our valuation allowance was released through the income tax provision or was a result of currency fluctuations on the portion of our valuation allowances recorded in foreign currencies 
additionally  in  we favorably resolved certain tax contingencies associated with our december acquisition of cremascoli 
the favorable resolution of these matters resulted in a reduction of our previously recorded accrual for tax contingencies and goodwill of approximately million 
our accruals for tax contingencies are included within other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
additional discussion of our accounting for income taxes is included in notes  and to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  which requires the recognition of compensation expense for the fair value of share based transactions 
we further describe this pronouncement and its anticipated impact on our results of operations under the heading  stock based expense within the results of operations section of md a 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 

sfas no 
will no longer allow companies to capitalize inventory costs on their balance sheet when the production defect rate varies significantly from the expected rate 
all abnormal freight  handling and material waste will be treated as period expenses 
additionally  sfas no 
requires that a facility s fixed production overhead be charged to inventory based on a range of normal capacity 
if the production level is abnormally low or high  unallocated overhead should be charged to current period expense 
sfas no 
is required to be adopted for annual periods beginning after june   accordingly  we will adopt sfas no 
effective january  we are evaluating the impact of this standard on our results of operations and financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued two fasb staff positions fsp in response to the jobs creation act related to accounting and disclosures associated with the provisions of the jobs creation act 
we further describe the jobs creation act and our evaluation of its impact within the results of operations section of md a 
fsp requires the deduction for qualified domestic production activities to be accounted for as a special deduction under sfas no 
 not as a tax rate deduction 
we will comply with the provisions of fsp effective january   should this deduction become available to us 
fsp allows for additional time for companies to determine whether any foreign earnings will be repatriated under the jobs creation act s one time deduction for repatriated earnings 
companies that take the additional time are required to provide disclosures about the status of their evaluation 
based on management s assessment of the repatriation deduction  we have determined to continue our current policy of permanently reinvesting all foreign earnings 
therefore  the provisions of fsp are not applicable to us 
factors affecting future operating results in addition to the factors described above in md a and elsewhere in this report  our future financial results could vary from period to period due to a variety of causes  including the following factors we are subject to substantial government regulation that could have a material adverse effect on our business the production and marketing of our products and our ongoing research and development  preclinical testing and clinical trial activities are subject to extensive regulation and review by numerous governmental authorities both in the us and abroad 
see business government regulation for further details on this process 
us and foreign regulations govern the testing  marketing and registration of new medical devices  in addition to regulating manufacturing practices  reporting  labeling and recordkeeping procedures 
the regulatory process requires significant time  effort and expenditures to bring our products to market  and we cannot be assured that any of our products will be approved 
our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in these governmental authorities 
table of contents imposing fines and penalties on us  preventing us from manufacturing or selling our products  bringing civil or criminal charges against us  delaying the introduction of our new products into the market  recalling or seizing our products  or withdrawing or denying approvals or clearances for our products 
even if regulatory approval or clearance of a product is granted  this could result in limitations on the uses for which the product may be labeled and promoted 
further  for a marketed product  its manufacturer and manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic review and inspection 
subsequent discovery of problems with a product  manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the product  manufacturer or facility  including withdrawal of the product from the market or other enforcement actions 
we are currently conducting clinical studies of some of our products under an ide 
clinical studies must be conducted in compliance with fda regulations  or the fda may take enforcement action 
the data collected from these clinical studies will ultimately be used to support market clearance for these products 
there is no assurance that the fda will accept the data from these clinical studies or that it will ultimately allow market clearance for these products 
our biologics business is subject to emerging governmental regulations that can significantly impact our business the fda has statutory authority to regulate allograft based products  processing and materials 
the fda has been working to establish a more comprehensive regulatory framework for allograft based products  which are principally derived from cadaveric tissue 
the framework developed by the fda establishes criteria for determining whether a particular human tissue based product will be classified as human tissue  a medical device or biologic drug requiring premarket clearance or approval 
all tissue based products are subject to extensive fda regulation  including a requirement that ensures that diseases are not transmitted to tissue recipients 
the fda has also proposed extensive additional regulations that would govern the processing and distribution of all allograft products 
consent to use the donor s tissue must also be obtained 
the regulations for allograft based products are still developing 
from time to time  the fda reviews these products and may informally suggest to us how these products should be classified 
if a human tissue based product is considered human tissue  it does not require fda clearance or approval before being marketed 
if it is considered a medical device or biologic drug  then fda clearance or approval may be required 
additionally  our biologics business involves the procurement and transplantation of allograft tissue  which is subject to federal regulation under nota 
nota prohibits the sale of human organs  including bone and other human tissue  for valuable consideration within the meaning of nota 
nota permits the payment of reasonable expenses associated with the transportation  processing  preservation  quality control and storage of human tissue 
we currently charge our customers for these expenses 
in the future  if nota is amended or reinterpreted  we may not be able to charge these expenses to our customers and  as a result  our business could be adversely affected 
our principal allograft based biologics offerings include allomatrix  graftjacket  and ignite products 
modifications to our marketed devices may require fda regulatory clearances or approvals or require us to cease marketing or recall the modified devices until such clearances or approvals are obtained when required  the products we market in the us have obtained premarket notification under section k of the fdc act or were exempt from the k clearance process 
we have modified some of our products and product labeling since obtaining k clearance  but we do not believe these modifications require us to submit new k 
table of contents notifications 
however  if the fda disagrees with us and requires us to submit a new k notification for modifications to our existing products  we may be the subject of enforcement actions by the fda and be required to stop marketing the products while the fda reviews the k notification 
if the fda requires us to go through a lengthier  more rigorous examination than we had expected  our product introductions or modifications could be delayed or canceled  which could cause our sales to decline 
in addition  the fda may determine that future products will require the more costly  lengthy and uncertain pma application process 
products that are approved through a pma application generally need fda approval before they can be modified 
see business government regulation 
if we lose one of our key suppliers  we may be unable to meet customer orders for our products in a timely manner or within our budget we rely on a limited number of suppliers for the components used in our products 
our reconstructive joint devices are produced from various surgical grades of titanium  cobalt chrome and stainless steel  various grades of high density polyethylenes  silicone elastomer and ceramics 
we rely on one supplier for the silicone elastomer used in our extremity products 
we are aware of only two suppliers of silicone elastomer to the medical device industry for permanent implant usage 
additionally  we rely on one supplier of ceramics for use in our hip products 
in addition  for our biologics products  we depend upon a limited number of sources of dbm and cbm  and any failure to obtain dbm and cbm from these sources in a timely manner will interfere with our ability to process and distribute allograft products 
two not for profit tissue banks supplied us with of the dbm and cbm  a key component in the allograft products we currently produce  market and distribute  that we obtained in the us in we cannot be sure that our supply of dbm and cbm will continue to be available at current levels or will be sufficient to meet our needs  or that our suppliers of dbm and cbm will be free from fda regulatory action impacting their sale of dbm and cbm 
since there is a small number of suppliers  if we cannot continue to obtain dbm and cbm from these sources in volumes sufficient to meet our needs  we may not be able to locate replacement sources of dbm and cbm on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
this could have the effect of interrupting our business  which could adversely affect our sales 
further  we rely on one supplier for our graftjacket family of soft tissue repair and graft containment products  as well as one supplier for our adcon gel products 
suppliers of raw materials and components may decide  or be required  for reasons beyond our control to cease supplying raw materials and components to us 
fda regulations may require additional testing of any raw materials or components from new suppliers prior to our use of these materials or components and in the case of a device with a pma application  we may be required to obtain prior fda permission  either of which could delay or prevent our access to or use of such raw materials or components 
if we fail to compete successfully in the future against our existing or potential competitors  our sales and operating results may be negatively affected and we may not achieve future growth the markets for our products are highly competitive and dominated by a small number of large companies 
we may not be able to meet the prices offered by our competitors  or offer products similar to or more desirable than those offered by our competitors 
see business competition 
if we are unable to continue to develop and market new products and technologies  we may experience a decrease in demand for our products or our products could become obsolete  and our business would suffer we are continually engaged in product development and improvement programs  and new products represent a significant component of our growth rate 
we may be unable to compete effectively with our competitors unless we can keep up with existing or new products and technologies in the orthopaedic implant market 
if we do not continue to introduce new products and technologies  or if those products and technologies are not accepted  we may not be successful 
additionally  our competitors new products and technologies may beat our products to market  may be more effective or less expensive than our products  or may render our products obsolete 
see business competition 

table of contents if our patents and other intellectual property rights do not adequately protect our products  we may lose market share to our competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably we rely on patents  trade secrets  copyrights  know how  trademarks  license agreements and contractual provisions to establish our intellectual property rights and protect our products 
see business intellectual property 
these legal means  however  afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights 
in addition  we cannot be assured that any of our pending patent applications will issue 
the uspto may deny or require a significant narrowing of the claims in our pending patent applications and the patents issuing from such applications 
any patents issuing from the pending patent applications may not provide us with significant commercial protection 
we could incur substantial costs in proceedings before the uspto 
these proceedings could result in adverse decisions as to the priority of our inventions and the narrowing or invalidation of claims in issued patents 
in addition  the laws of some of the countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as us laws or at all 
we also may be unable to protect our rights in trade secrets and unpatented proprietary technology in these countries 
in addition  we hold licenses from third parties that are necessary to utilize certain technologies used in the design and manufacturing of some of our products 
the loss of such licenses would prevent us from manufacturing  marketing and selling these products  which could harm our business 
we seek to protect our trade secrets  know how and other unpatented proprietary technology  in part  with confidentiality agreements with our employees  independent distributors and consultants 
we cannot be assured  however  that the agreements will not be breached  adequate remedies for any breach would be available  or our trade secrets  know how  and other unpatented proprietary technology will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by our competitors 
if we lose any existing or future intellectual property lawsuits  a court could require us to pay significant damages or prevent us from selling our products the medical device industry is litigious with respect to patents and other intellectual property rights 
companies in the medical device industry have used intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage 
we are currently involved in an intellectual property lawsuit with howmedica osteonics corp  a subsidiary of stryker corporation  where it is alleged that our advance knee product line infringes one of howmedica s patents 
see legal proceedings for more information regarding this lawsuit 
if howmedica were to succeed in obtaining the relief it claims  the court could award damages to howmedica and impose an injunction against further sales of our product 
if a monetary judgment is rendered against us  we may be forced to raise or borrow funds  as a supplement to any available insurance claim proceeds  to pay the damages award 
in the future  we may become a party to other lawsuits involving patents or other intellectual property 
a legal proceeding  regardless of the outcome  could drain our financial resources and divert the time and effort of our management 
if we lose one of these proceedings  a court  or a similar foreign governing body  could require us to pay significant damages to third parties  require us to seek licenses from third parties and pay ongoing royalties  require us to redesign our products  or prevent us from manufacturing  using or selling our products 
in addition to being costly  protracted litigation to defend or prosecute our intellectual property rights could result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of the affected products until resolution of the litigation 
if product liability lawsuits are brought against us  our business may be harmed the manufacture and sale of medical devices exposes us to significant risk of product liability claims 
in the past  we have had a number of product liability claims relating to our products  none of which either individually  or in the aggregate  have resulted in a material negative impact on our business 
in the future  we may be subject to additional product liability claims  some of which may have a negative impact on our business 
additionally  we could experience a material design or manufacturing failure in our products  a quality system failure  other safety issues  or heightened regulatory scrutiny that would warrant a recall of some of our products 
our existing product liability insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us from any liabilities we might incur 
if a product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of our insurance coverage  our business 
table of contents could suffer 
in addition  a recall of some of our products  whether or not the result of a product liability claim  could result in significant costs and loss of customers 
fluctuations in insurance expense could adversely affect our profitability we hold a number of insurance policies  including product liability insurance  directors and officers liability insurance  property insurance and workers compensation insurance 
in recent years  our industry has experienced significant increases in product liability insurance premiums 
if the costs of maintaining adequate insurance coverage should increase significantly in the future  our operating results could be materially adversely impacted 
if we cannot retain our key personnel  we will not be able to manage and operate successfully and we may not be able to meet our strategic objectives our continued success depends  in part  upon key managerial  scientific  sales and technical personnel  as well as our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel 
we compete for such personnel with other companies  academic institutions  governmental entities and other organizations 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining our current personnel or in hiring or retaining qualified personnel in the future 
loss of key personnel or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate successfully 
further  our ability to enforce non compete arrangements related to key personnel who have left the business could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we derive a significant portion of our sales from operations in international markets that are subject to political  economic and social instability we derive a significant portion of our sales from operations in international markets 
our international distribution system consists of direct sales offices and stocking distribution partners  which combined employ approximately sales representatives who sell in over countries 
most of these countries are  to some degree  subject to political  social and economic instability 
for the years ended december  and  approximately of our net sales were derived from our international operations 
our international sales operations expose us and our representatives  agents and distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions 
these risks include the imposition of additional foreign governmental controls or regulations on orthopaedic implants and biologics products  new export license requirements  particularly related to our biologics products  economic instability  including currency risk between the us dollar and foreign currencies  in our target markets  a shortage of high quality international salespeople and distributors  loss of any key personnel who possess proprietary knowledge or are otherwise important to our success in international markets  changes in third party reimbursement policy that may require some of the patients who receive our implant products to directly absorb medical costs or that may necessitate our reducing selling prices for our products  changes in tariffs and other trade restrictions  particularly related to the exportation of our biologics products  work stoppages or strikes in the health care industry  such as those that have previously affected our operations in france  canada  korea and finland in the past  a shortage of nurses in some of our target markets  particularly affecting our operations in france  and exposure to different legal and political standards due to our conducting business in over countries 

table of contents any material decrease in our foreign sales would negatively impact our profitability 
our international sales are predominately generated in europe 
in europe  health care regulation and reimbursement for medical devices vary significantly from country to country 
this changing environment could adversely affect our ability to sell our products in some european countries 
our business could suffer if the medical community does not continue to accept allograft technology new allograft products  technologies and enhancements may never achieve broad market acceptance due to numerous factors  including lack of clinical acceptance of allograft products and related technologies  the introduction of competitive tissue repair treatment options that render allograft products and technologies too expensive and obsolete  lack of available third party reimbursement  the inability to train surgeons in the use of allograft products and technologies  the risk of disease transmission  and ethical concerns about the commercial aspects of harvesting cadaveric tissue 
market acceptance will also depend on the ability to demonstrate that existing and new allografts and technologies are attractive alternatives to existing tissue repair treatment options 
to demonstrate this  we rely upon surgeon evaluations of the clinical safety  efficacy  ease of use  reliability and cost effectiveness of our tissue repair options and technologies 
recommendations and endorsements by influential surgeons are important to the commercial success of allograft products and technologies 
in addition  several countries  notably japan  prohibit the use of allografts 
if allograft products and technologies are not broadly accepted in the marketplace  we may not achieve a competitive position in the market 
if adequate levels of reimbursement from third party payors for our products are not obtained  surgeons and patients may be reluctant to use our products and our sales may decline in the us  health care providers that purchase our products generally rely on third party payors  principally federal medicare  state medicaid and private health insurance plans  to pay for all or a portion of the cost of joint reconstructive procedures and products utilized in those procedures 
we may be unable to sell our products on a profitable basis if third party payors deny coverage or reduce their current levels of reimbursement 
our sales depend largely on governmental health care programs and private health insurers reimbursing patients medical expenses 
surgeons  hospitals and other health care providers may not purchase our products if they do not receive satisfactory reimbursement from these third party payors for the cost of the procedures using our products 
payors continue to review their coverage policies carefully for existing and new therapies and can  without notice  deny coverage for treatments that include the use of our products 
in addition  some health care providers in the us have adopted or are considering a managed care system in which the providers contract to provide comprehensive heath care for a fixed cost per person 
health care providers may attempt to control costs by authorizing fewer elective surgical procedures  including joint reconstructive surgeries  or by requiring the use of the least expensive implant available 
if adequate levels of reimbursement from third party payors outside of the us are not obtained  international sales of our products may decline 
outside of the us  reimbursement systems vary significantly by country 
many foreign markets have government managed health care systems that govern reimbursement for medical devices and procedures 
canada  and some european and asian countries  in particular france  japan  taiwan  and korea  have tightened reimbursement rates 
additionally  some foreign reimbursement systems provide for limited payments in a given period and therefore result in extended payment periods 
see business third party reimbursement for more information regarding reimbursement in the us and abroad 

table of contents if market clearance is not obtained for the re launch of the adcon gel products and the launch of the conserve plus implant in the us  growth of our biologics and hip product lines could be impacted our adcon gel products and our conserve plus resurfacing implant are available outside the us and are pending fda clearance for the us market 
there can be no assurance that the sale of our adcon gel or conserve plus products in the us will be cleared by the fda in a timely manner or at all  which could have a significant impact on the future growth of our biologics and hip product lines  respectively 
if surgeons do not recommend and endorse our products  our sales may decline or we may be unable to increase our sales and profits in order for us to sell our products  surgeons must recommend and endorse them 
we may not obtain the necessary recommendations or endorsements from surgeons 
acceptance of our products depends on educating the medical community as to the distinctive characteristics  perceived benefits  clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness of our products compared to products of our competitors and on training surgeons in the proper application of our products 
if a natural or man made disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities  we could be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and our sales could decline we have relied to date principally on our manufacturing facilities in arlington  tennessee  and toulon  france 
these facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be difficult to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace 
our facilities may be affected by natural or man made disasters 
in the event one of our facilities was affected by a disaster  we would be forced to rely on third party manufacturers or shift production to our other manufacturing facility 
although we believe we possess adequate insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business from casualties  such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
our business plan relies on certain assumptions about the market for our products  which  if incorrect  may adversely affect our profitability we believe that the aging of the general population and increasingly active lifestyles will continue and that these trends will increase the need for our orthopaedic implant products 
the projected demand for our products could materially differ from actual demand if our assumptions regarding these trends and acceptance of our products by the medical community prove to be incorrect or do not materialize  or if non surgical treatments gain more widespread acceptance as a viable alternative to orthopaedic implants 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported sales and earnings since a majority of our international sales are denominated in local currencies and not in us dollars  our reported sales and earnings are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
our international net sales were favorably affected by the impact of foreign currency fluctuations totaling million in and million in during the second half of  we began a derivative program using day foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations on our intercompany receivable and payable balances that are denominated in foreign currencies 
these forward contracts are expected to offset the transactional gains and losses on the related intercompany balances 
these forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
accordingly  the changes in the fair value and the settlement of the contracts are recognized in the period incurred 
efforts to acquire and integrate other companies or product lines could adversely affect our operations and financial results we may pursue acquisitions of other companies or product lines 
our ability to grow through acquisitions depends upon our ability to identify  negotiate  complete and integrate suitable acquisitions and to obtain any necessary financing 
even if we complete acquisitions  we may also experience 
table of contents difficulties in integrating any acquired companies  personnel and products into our existing business  delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company or products  diversion of our management s time and attention from other business concerns  limited or no direct prior experience in new markets or countries we may enter  higher costs of integration than we anticipated  or difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired business who are necessary to manage these acquisitions 
in addition  an acquisition could materially impair our operating results by causing us to incur debt or requiring us to amortize acquisition expenses and acquired assets 
our quarterly operating results are subject to substantial fluctuations and you should not rely on them as an indication of our future results our quarterly operating results may vary significantly due to a combination of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include demand for products  which historically has been lowest in the third quarter  our ability to meet the demand for our products  increased competition  the number  timing and significance of new products and product introductions and enhancements by us and our competitors  our ability to develop  introduce and market new and enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis  changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors  changes in the treatment practices of orthopaedic surgeons  changes in distributor relationships and sales force size and composition  the timing of material expense or income generating events and the related recognition of their associated financial impact  the timing of significant orders and shipments  availability of raw materials  work stoppages or strikes in the health care industry  changes in fda and foreign governmental regulatory policies  requirements and enforcement practices  changes in accounting policies  estimates  and treatments  and general economic factors 

table of contents we believe that our quarterly sales and operating results may vary significantly in the future and that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
we cannot assure you that our sales will increase or be sustained in future periods or that we will be profitable in any future period 
any shortfalls in sales or earnings from levels expected by securities or orthopaedic industry analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock in any given period 
we rely on our independent sales distributors and sales representatives to market and sell our products our success depends largely upon marketing arrangements with independent sales distributors and sales representatives  in particular their sales and service expertise and relationships with the customers in the marketplace 
independent distributors and sales representatives may terminate their relationships with us or devote insufficient sales efforts to our products 
we do not control our independent distributors and they may not be successful in implementing our marketing plans 
our failure to maintain our existing relationships with our independent distributors and sales representatives could have an adverse effect on our operations 
similarly  our failure to recruit and retain additional skilled independent sales distributors and sales representatives could have an adverse effect on our operations 
we have experienced turnover with some of our independent distributors in the past which adversely affected short term financial results while we transitioned to new independent distributors 
while we believe these transitions have been managed effectively  similar occurrences could happen in the future with different results which could have a greater adverse effect on our operations than we have previously experienced 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk arises principally from the variable rates associated with our credit facility 
on december   we had borrowings of million under our credit facility which are subject to a variable interest rate  with a current annual rate of 
the carrying value of these borrowings approximates fair value due to the variable rate 
based on this debt level  a increase in the interest rate of all such borrowings would cause us to incur an increase in interest expense of approximately  on an annual basis 
we currently do not hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations  but may do so in the future 
foreign currency rate fluctuations fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies could adversely affect our financial results 
approximately of our total net sales were denominated in foreign currencies during the year ended december  we expect that foreign currencies will continue to represent a similarly significant percentage of our net sales in the future 
costs related to these sales are largely denominated in the same respective currencies  thereby limiting our transaction risk exposures 
however  for sales not denominated in us dollars  if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars  it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases  if we price our products in the foreign currency  we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect 
if we price our products in us dollars and competitors price their products in local currency  an increase in the relative strength of the us dollar could result in our prices not being competitive in a market where business is transacted in the local currency 
a substantial majority of our sales denominated in foreign currencies are derived from european union countries and are denominated in the euro 
additionally  we have significant intercompany receivables from our foreign subsidiaries which are denominated in foreign currencies  principally the euro and the japanese yen 
our principal exchange rate risk  therefore  exists between the us dollar and the euro and the us dollar and the yen 
fluctuations from the beginning to the end of any given reporting period result in the revaluation of our foreign currency denominated intercompany receivables and payables  generating currency translation gains or losses that impact our non operating income expense levels in the respective period 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report  during the second half of  we entered into certain short term derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward contracts 
these forward contracts are designed to mitigate our exposure to currency fluctuations in our intercompany balances denominated in euros  japanese yen and canadian dollars 
any change in the fair value of these forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be offset by a change in the value of the intercompany balance 
these contracts are effectively closed at the end of each reporting period
