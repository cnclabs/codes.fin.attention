item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
portions of this document that are not statements of historical or current fact are forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements in this document involve risk and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this document should be read as applying to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include  but are not limited to  the following risks related to the growth of our fast contract  including strains on resources and decreases in operating margins  federal government audits and cost adjustments  differences between authorized amounts and amounts received by us under government contracts  government customers failure to exercise options under contracts  changes in federal government or other applicable procurement laws  regulations  policies and budgets  our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  our ability to retain contracts during re bidding processes  pricing pressures  undertaking acquisitions that might increase our costs or liabilities or be disruptive  integration of acquisitions  including the acquisitions of cti  mti  and onboard  and changes in general economic and business conditions 
overview we provide sophisticated systems engineering  information technology  intelligence and program management services primarily to us defense  intelligence and civilian federal government agencies 
our services encompass the full system life cycle from requirements definition  design  development and integration to upgrade  sustainment and support for mission critical information and weapons systems 
for the years ended december    and  about   and  respectively  of our revenue was derived from our customers in the department of defense and the intelligence community  including the us air force  us army and joint military commands 
having served the department of defense since our founding in  we believe we are well positioned to assist the federal government as it conducts the war on global terrorism and modernizes its defense capabilities 

table of contents mtc technologies  inc 
and subsidiaries we report operating results and financial data as a single segment and believe our contract base is well diversified 
however  a significant amount of our revenue has in recent years been earned under two contracts  the asc bpa and the fast contract 
revenue under the asc bpa was approximately   and  of our total revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the largest task order under the asc bpa amounted to approximately   and of total revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the asc bpa  which was originally awarded as a small business set aside contract  expires on september  and the replacement contract will also be a small business set aside contract for which we will not qualify to bid as a prime contractor 
while we believe we have a viable strategy to retain the bulk of our work and profitability on the replacement contract by becoming a subcontractor for a number of small businesses bidding on the re compete  our ability to retain work under the replacement contract is uncertain 
it is possible that some of our current work under the asc bpa could be converted to gsa schedules or other contract vehicles 
in july  we were one of six awardees of the fast contract with a ceiling of billion and with a period of performance  including option years  which extends to revenue under the fast contract was approximately   and  of total revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
fast contract revenue for the year ended december  was comprised of over separate task orders  the largest of which amounted to approximately of total revenue for that period 
in prior years  we performed some of the work we are now performing on the fast contract on other contract vehicles 
while the fast contract represents a significant percentage of our total revenue  we believe that the broad array of engineering  technical and management services we provide to the federal government through various contract vehicles allows for diversified business growth 
no other task order  including individual contracts under our gsa vehicles  accounted for more than of revenue for the year ended december  under the fast contract  we have the potential to compete for hundreds of millions of dollars in task orders over its approximately three and a half year remaining life as the us air force maintains and modernizes aircraft and defense systems 
as of december   we have been awarded over individual task orders under the fast contract with a remaining potential award value of approximately million if all options are exercised 
although we believe the fast contract presents an opportunity for significant additional growth and expansion of our services  we expect that many of the task orders we may be awarded under the fast contract will be for program management services  which historically have been less profitable than our other activities 
in addition  the fast contract involves a significantly greater use of subcontractors than we have used historically 
margins on subcontractor based revenue are typically lower than the margins on our direct work 
since the fast contract is expected to be a significant part of our business for the next several years  it is possible that our operating income  as a percentage of total revenue  could diminish  while growing in absolute dollars 
our federal government contracts  which comprised over of our revenue in  are subject to government audits of our direct and indirect costs 
the incurred cost audits have been completed through december  and the rates have been agreed to 
we do not anticipate any material adjustment to our financial statements in subsequent periods for audits not yet completed 
for the years ended december    and  approximately   and  respectively  of our revenue came from work provided to our customers as a prime contractor and the balance came from work provided as a subcontractor 
approximately   and of our revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively  consisted of the work of our employees  and the balance was provided by the work of subcontractors 
our work as a prime contractor on the fast contract has resulted  and is expected to continue to result  in a significant use of subcontractors 
the increased use of subcontractors on the fast contract has been partially offset by the business model of our recent acquisitions  which typically have not used subcontractors to a great extent 

table of contents mtc technologies  inc 
and subsidiaries we typically provide our services under contracts with a base term  often of three years  and option terms  typically two to four additional terms of one year or more  which the customer can exercise on an annual basis 
we also have contracts with fixed terms  some extending as long as five or six years 
although we occasionally obtain government contracts for which the contracting agency obligates funding for the full term of the contract  most of our government contracts receive incremental funding  which subjects us to the risks associated with the government s annual appropriations process 
contract types 
when contracting with our government customers  we enter into one of three basic types of contracts time and materials  fixed price and cost plus 
time and materials contracts 
under a time and materials contract  we receive a fixed hourly rate for each direct labor hour worked  plus reimbursement for our allowable direct costs 
to the extent that our actual labor costs vary significantly from the negotiated rates under a time and materials contract  we can either make more money than we originally anticipated or lose money on the contract 
fixed price contracts 
under fixed price contracts  we agree to perform specified work for a firm  fixed price 
if our actual costs exceed our estimate of the costs to perform the contract  we may generate less profit or incur a loss 
a significant portion of our fixed price contract work is under a fixed price level of effort contract  which represents a similar level of risk to our time and materials contracts  under which we agree to perform certain units of work for a fixed price per unit 
we generally do not undertake high risk work  such as software development  under fixed price contracts 
cost plus contracts 
under cost plus contracts  we are reimbursed for allowable costs and receive a supplemental fee  which represents our profit 
cost plus fixed fee contracts specify the contract fee in dollars or as a percentage of anticipated costs 
cost plus incentive fee and cost plus award fee contracts provide for increases or decreases in the contract fee  within specified limits  based upon actual results as compared to contractual targets for factors such as cost  quality  schedule and performance 
the following table provides information about the percentage of revenue attributable to each of these types of contracts for the periods indicated years ended december  time and materials fixed price cost plus total critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
our critical accounting policies primarily concern revenue recognition and related cost estimation 
we recognize revenue under our government contracts when a contract has been executed  the contract price is fixed and determinable  delivery of services or products has occurred  and collection of the contract price is considered probable and can be reasonably estimated 
revenue is earned under time and materials  fixed price and cost plus contracts 
we recognize revenue on time and materials contracts to the extent of billable rates times hours delivered  plus expenses incurred 
for fixed price contracts within the scope of statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop  revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method using costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs or upon delivery of specific products or services  as appropriate 
for fixed price completion contracts that are not within the scope 
table of contents mtc technologies  inc 
and subsidiaries of sop  revenue is generally recognized as earned according to contract terms as the service is provided 
we will provide our customer with a number of different services that are generally documented through separate negotiated task orders that detail the services to be provided and the company s compensation for these services 
services rendered under each task order represent an independent earnings process and are not dependent on any other service or product sold 
we recognize revenue on cost plus contracts to the extent of allowable costs incurred plus a proportionate amount of the fee earned  which may be fixed or performance based 
we consider fixed fees under cost plus contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract  which generally corresponds to the timing of contractual billings 
we record provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts in the period in which we identify those losses 
we consider performance based fees  including award fees  under any contract type to be earned only when we can demonstrate satisfaction of a specific performance goal or we receive contractual notification from a customer that the fee has been earned 
in all cases  we recognize revenue only when pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists including when waiting for formal funding authorization under federal government contracts  services have been rendered  the contract price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
contract revenue recognition inherently involves estimation 
from time to time  facts develop that require us to revise the total estimated costs or revenues expected 
in most cases  these changes relate to changes in the contractual scope of the work and do not significantly impact the expected profit rate on a contract 
we record the cumulative effects of any revisions to the estimated total costs and revenues in the period in which the facts become known 
we began recording work in process inventory during the second quarter of because some of our task orders under the fast contract have reached the production delivery stage 
on these task orders  we are now required to meet customer delivery schedules as part of our program management services 
the inventory relates to costs accumulated under fixed price type contracts accounted for under the completed contract method and certain output measures  such as units delivered  of the percentage of completion method 
the work in process inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market and is computed on an average cost basis 
goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired companies 
purchase price allocated to intangible assets is amortized using the straight line method over the estimated terms of the contracts  which range from three to eight years 
we perform impairment reviews on an annual basis 
we have elected to conduct our annual impairment reviews as of the fourth quarter of each year 
we base our assessment of possible impairment on the discounted present value of the operating cash flows of our consolidated operating unit 
we determined that no impairment charges were required in and income taxes 
we calculate our income tax provision using the asset and liability method 
under the asset and liability method  deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates would be recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
prior to june   the date that we changed our s corporation status to c corporation status  all items of income and expense were passed through and taxed at the stockholder level 
therefore  we were not required to record a provision for federal and state income taxes 
accordingly  the december  income statement does not reflect an income tax provision for the periods prior to june

and subsidiaries results of operations our results of operations may not be directly comparable on a year to year basis due to acquisitions we made throughout the three years ended december  we acquired cti in july   vitronics and ici in october   and amcomp in october  additionally  in the first quarter of  we acquired mti and onboard 
as part of our overall strategy to expand our customer reach and technical capabilities  we expect to continue to strategically acquire complementary businesses in the future

our organic growth of million was the result of an increase in work on new or existing contracts and task orders  primarily from growth in fast  defense information systems network  pm soldier systems  and cisr task orders 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  increased  or million  to million as compared to million for this increase primarily reflects the significant increase in revenue 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  was as compared to for this decrease in gross margin as a percentage was primarily due to the increase in cost plus contracts for as compared to general and administrative expenses total general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased  or approximately million  to million as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of increased salary and benefit expenses resulting from the addition of personnel to support our growth as well as an increase in professional fees associated with establishing our office in germany and for compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of however  general and administrative expenses declined from approximately of revenue in to approximately of revenue in as a result of operating efficiencies 
intangible asset amortization intangible asset amortization for the year ended december  increased approximately million to million as compared to million for the year ended

operating income operating income for the year ended december  increased  or million  to million as compared to million for the year ended december   primarily resulting from the increased gross profit  partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses and intangible asset amortization 
it should be noted that operating income as a percentage of revenue was approximately in compared to approximately in operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased because of the increase in intangible amortization expense  which increased as a percentage of revenue from approximately in to approximately in the decline in operating income as a percentage caused by increased intangible amortization expense was partially offset by an improvement in the operating leverage of cash expenses

million of our organic growth was delivered through the use of subcontractors  primarily in connection with several task orders under the fast contract 
the balance of our organic growth was the result of a million increase in work by our own people on new or increased contracts and task orders  primarily from growth in fast  asc bpa and gsa task orders 
the increase in direct revenue was partially offset by a million decrease in revenue from our two largest non defense customer groups and decreased revenue on task orders that ended after december  gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  increased  or million  to million as compared to million for this increase primarily reflects the significant increase in revenue 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  was as compared to for this decrease in gross margin percentage is primarily attributable to the previously forecasted increase in the use of subcontractors 
margins on subcontractor based revenue are typically lower than the margins on our direct work 
general and administrative expenses total general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   decreased  or approximately million  to million as compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease is solely attributable to the million non cash stock compensation expense that was recorded in march  as discussed below 
without this charge  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  would have increased  or million as compared to the prior year  primarily as a result of increased salary and benefit expenses resulting from the addition of personnel to support our growth as well as increased insurance and bid and proposal costs 
however  the percentage of general and administrative expenses before stock compensation declined as a percentage of revenue from for the year ended december  to for non cash stock compensation expense of million was recorded in march in connection with the issuance to three senior executives of non qualified options to purchase  shares of common stock 
the charge represents the difference between the option price of and the estimated fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant of per share 
all other options issued since march have an option price equal to the estimated fair market value of the shares at the date of the grant and as such require no charge against earnings 
intangible asset amortization intangible asset amortization for the year ended december  increased approximately million  to million as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is a result of a full year of amortization of the purchase price allocated to the contracts of amcomp of million as well as the million of intangible asset amortization recorded in the fourth quarter of for the acquisitions of ici and vitronics 
operating income operating income for the year ended december  increased  or million  to million as compared to million for the year ended december  a major cause of this increase in operating income was primarily the result of the million non cash stock compensation expense that was recorded in march  as discussed above 
without this charge  operating income for the year ended december  would have increased  or million as compared to  primarily resulting from the increased gross profit  partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses excluding the non cash stock compensation expense and intangible asset amortization

income tax expense we did not record a provision for income taxes for the periods prior to june  because we were an s corporation for income tax purposes and  as a result  were not subject to federal or certain state income taxes 
on june   we changed from an s corporation to a c corporation under internal revenue service code 
as a result of this change  we were required under sfas no 
to establish deferred tax balances 
as a result  a non cash deferred tax benefit of million and current and non current deferred tax assets were recorded in june  primarily for timing differences between book and tax reporting associated with accrued compensation items 
during the third quarter of  we began recording a provision for federal and state income taxes

our investing activities used cash of million for the year ended december  compared with million in the same period of the increase in cash used in investing activities was due primarily to the additional consideration of million paid to the former shareholders of amcomp in april and the purchase price and acquisition related payments totaling million paid in the fourth quarter of for the acquisitions of ici and vitronics 
our financing activities provided net cash of million for the year ended december   primarily from the net proceeds from the public offering of  shares of common stock that was completed in february  as well as the effect of common stock issuances related to stock option transactions 
during the year ended december   cash provided from financing activities was million  primarily due to net common stock issuances and surrenders related to stock option transactions 
during the year ended december   cash provided from financing activities was million 
the cash was primarily provided by the net proceeds of our initial public offering of million 
we used a portion of these proceeds to repay our total bank debt outstanding on july   reducing the amount outstanding under those instruments from million as of december  to zero 
prior to our initial public offering  we also made million of distributions to our then sole stockholder  offset by a million capital contribution from our then sole stockholder 
in february  we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock 
our net proceeds from the sale of the shares  after the underwriting discount and other expenses  were million 
we used the net proceeds from the offering together with cash on hand and additional borrowings for working capital and general corporate purposes  as well as for the acquisition of complementary businesses 
certain contingent payment obligations related to the acquisitions made since october require us to make additional cash payments and issue additional shares of our common stock in see business acquisitions above 
in january  we purchased all of the outstanding capital stock of onboard from its sole shareholder 
the initial purchase price was million paid from cash on hand at closing 
in addition  onboard s shareholder may receive additional cash payments through if certain operating goals are achieved 
it is anticipated that the company will realize income tax benefits with a net present value of approximately million in future periods as the result of the onboard shareholder agreeing to a section h election under the internal revenue code of in february  we purchased all of the outstanding capital stock of mti 
the initial purchase price was million paid in cash at closing  of which approximately million was from available cash on hand and million of which was borrowed under on our revolving credit facility 
mti shareholders may receive additional cash payments of up to million if certain operating goals are achieved in it is also anticipated that the company will realize income tax benefits with a net present value of approximately million in future periods as the result of the mti shareholders agreeing to a section h election under the internal revenue code of during  we had a million revolving credit facility that could be increased to million subject to meeting certain requirements and obtaining our lenders approval 
the credit agreement governing this revolving credit facility was initially scheduled to expire on december   however  in july  we amended the agreement to extend the term to december  the credit agreement can be extended for additional one year terms by mutual agreement with our lenders 
in december  we amended the credit 
table of contents mtc technologies  inc 
and subsidiaries agreement with the same four banks  increasing the borrowing availability to million  as well as modifying certain financial covenants 
generally  the interest rate we pay on borrowings range from the prime rate less basis points to prime rate plus basis points  or the london interbank offered rate libor plus to basis points  depending on the ratio of our funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility are secured by a general lien on our consolidated assets 
we are also subject to certain restrictions and we are required to meet certain financial covenants 
these covenants require that we  among other things  maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth levels 
these covenants also restrict our activities regarding the incurrence of additional indebtedness in excess of million other than the debt incurred under the revolving credit facility 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
as of february  we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate of prime less basis points 
the company is required to pay interest in march  june  september  and december of each calendar year beginning in march part of our growth strategy is to pursue strategic acquisitions of businesses 
we have made acquisitions in the past  and intend to make acquisitions in the future 
historically  we have financed our acquisitions with the proceeds of our public common stock offerings  cash on hand and shares of our common stock 
we expect to finance future acquisitions with cash generated by operations  additional sales or issuances of shares of our common stock  borrowings under our credit facility or a combination of the foregoing 
we will take actions to increase the availability under our credit facility as needed to support our future growth 
management believes that the cash generated by operations and amounts available under our credit facility  will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements  debt service obligations  purchase price commitments for completed acquisitions and capital expenditures for the next twelve months and through december when our revolving credit facility expires 
our ability to generate cash from operations depends to a significant extent on winning new and re competed contracts and or task orders from our customers in competitive bidding processes 
if a significant portion of our government contracts were terminated or if our win rate on new or re competed contracts and task orders were to decline significantly  our operating cash flow would decrease  which would adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as special purpose entities spes or variable interest entities vies  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes

and supersedes apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be valued at fair value on the date of grant and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period

sfas no 
r is effective for all stock based awards granted on or after july  in addition  companies must also recognize compensation expense related to any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date 
compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
we are currently assessing the impact of adopting sfas r to our consolidated results of operations 
quarterly results of operations our results of operations  particularly our revenue  gross profit and cash flow  may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors  including the progress of contract performance  revenue earned on contracts  the number of billable days in a quarter  the timing of customer orders or deliveries  changes in the scope of contracts and billing of other direct and subcontract costs  timing of funding of task orders  the commencement and completion of contracts we have been awarded and general economic conditions 
because a significant portion of our expenses  such as personnel and facilities costs  are fixed in the short term  successful contract performance and variation in the volume of activity  as well as in the number of contracts or task orders commenced or completed during any quarter  may cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
the federal government s fiscal year ends september if a federal budget for the next fiscal year has not been approved by that date in each year  our customers may have to suspend engagements that we are working on until a budget has been approved 
any suspensions may cause us to realize lower revenue in the fourth quarter of the year  and possibly ensuing quarters of the following year 
on october   president bush signed the national defense authorization act for fiscal year in addition  a change in presidential administrations  congressional majorities or in other senior federal government officials may negatively affect the rate at which the federal government purchases technology and engineering services 
the federal government s fiscal year end can also trigger increased purchase requests from customers for equipment and materials 
any increased purchase requests we receive as a result of the federal government s fiscal year end would serve to increase our fourth quarter revenues  but will generally decrease profit margins for that quarter  as these activities typically are not as profitable as our normal service offerings 
further  some of our subcontractors have calendar year ends and sometimes submit large billings at the end of the calendar year that can cause a spike in our revenue and expenses related to subcontracts 
this will also generally decrease our profit margins as revenues generated by billings from subcontractors generally have much lower margins than our revenues generated by direct work 
as a result of the above factors  period to period comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful 
potential investors should not rely on these comparisons as indicators of future performance as no assurances can be given that quarterly results will not fluctuate  causing a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates for borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
as a result of our initial public offering that was completed july   all of the borrowings under our revolving credit facility were repaid 
as of december   we did not have any outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
primarily in connection with our acquisition of mti  we borrowed funds under our revolving credit facility subsequent to december   and had million outstanding as of february  we have invested a significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents in short term  investment grade  interest bearing securities including guaranteed obligations of the united states and its agencies 
a hypothetical change in interest rates on these securities would not have  and during the year ended december  and the preceding fiscal year would not have had  a significant impact on future earnings or the fair market value of the securities
