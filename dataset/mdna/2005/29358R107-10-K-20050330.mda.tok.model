recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and prescribes that goodwill should no longer be amortized upon adoption of the standard 
instead  goodwill will be tested annually for impairment and on an interim basis if certain impairment indicators are present 
the company had approximately  of unamortized goodwill related to b line classified as a component of partially owned equity affiliates at december  upon adoption of sfas on january   the company ceased amortization of this goodwill 
in addition  bh acquisition had negative goodwill of approximately million recorded on its financial statements as of december  in accordance with sfas  bh acquisition reversed this negative goodwill into earnings upon adoption of sfas and presented it as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the company s proportionate share of this reversal was  net of income taxes  and was presented as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  in january  the fasb issued fin r which requires consolidation by a business enterprise of a vie if the enterprise is determined to be the primary beneficiary 
the company believes that each of the jcf cfn entities qualifies as a vie and that the company is the primary beneficiary of each such entity 
as such  the jcf cfn entities are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  with castlewood holdings interest in the jcf cfn entities reflected as a minority interest in the company s financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires that the compensation cost resulting from all share based payment transactions eg stock options and restricted stock be recognized in the financial statements 
sfas r requires all entities to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for share based payment transactions with employees and non employees except for equity instruments held by employee share ownership plans 
this statement replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes the accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
the company currently accounts for employee share based payment awards under the provisions of apb the company will apply the provisions of sfas r for the first interim reporting period beginning after june  the company is currently evaluating the impact that the implementation of this statement will have on its consolidated financial position and results of operations 
critical accounting policies enstar in the ordinary course of business  the company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements include estimates associated with its evaluation of income tax valuation allowance 
income tax valuation allowance the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
the effect of temporary differences on the financial statements includes certain operating losses of partially owned foreign subsidiaries and tax credit carryforwards 
the company has established a valuation allowance for the uncertainty of the realization of these and any other net deferred tax assets 
however  utilization of the remaining deferred tax assets at december   is based on management s assessment of the company s earnings history  expectations of future taxable income  and other relevant considerations 
castlewood holdings and bh acquisition certain amounts in castlewood holdings and bh acquisition s consolidated financial statements are the result of transactions that require the use of best estimates and assumptions to determine reported values 
these amounts could ultimately be materially different than what has been provided for in their consolidated financial statements 
the assessment of loss reserves and reinsurance recoverable are considered to be the values requiring the most inherently subjective and complex estimates 
in addition  the assessment of the possible impairment of goodwill involves certain estimates and assumptions 
as such  the accounting policies for these amounts are of critical importance to their consolidated financial statements 
loss and loss adjustment expenses because a significant amount of time can lapse between the assumption of risk  the occurrence of a loss event  the reporting of the event to an insurance or reinsurance company and the ultimate payment of the claim on the loss event  castlewood holdings and bh acquisition s liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses is based largely upon estimates 
castlewood holdings and bh acquisition s management must use considerable judgment in the process of developing these estimates 
the liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses for property and casualty business includes amounts determined from loss reports on individual cases and amounts for losses incurred but not reported 
such reserves are reviewed and estimated by management quarterly based upon reports received from ceding companies and annually based upon independent actuarial estimates of ultimate unpaid losses 
castlewood holdings and bh acquisition s ultimate liability may be significantly greater than or less than the amount estimated  with any adjustments in such estimates being reflected in the periods in which they become known 
reinsurance balances receivable one of the ways loss exposure is managed is through the use of reinsurance 
while reinsurance arrangements are designed to limit losses and to permit recovery of a portion of direct unpaid losses  reinsurance does not relieve castlewood holdings or bh acquisition of their liabilities to their insureds 
accordingly  loss reserves represent total gross losses  and reinsurance recoverable represents anticipated recoveries of a portion of those unpaid losses as well as amounts recoverable from reinsurers with respect to claims  which have already been paid 
goodwill on january   castlewood holdings and bh acquisition adopted sfas this statement requires that goodwill be assessed for impairment on at least an annual basis 
in determining goodwill  castlewood holdings must determine the fair values of the assets of an acquired company 
the determination of fair value necessarily involves many assumptions 
fair values of reinsurance assets and liabilities acquired are derived from probability weighted ranges of the associated projected cash flows  based on actuarially prepared information and management run off strategy 
fair value adjustments are based on the estimated timing of loss and loss adjustment expense payments and an assumed interest rate  and are amortized over the estimated payout period  as adjusted for accelerations on commutation settlements  using the constant yield method options 
if the assumptions made in initially valuing the assets change significantly in the future  castlewood holdings may be required to record impairment charges which could have a material impact on the financial statements 
castlewood holdings assessed its recorded goodwill in in accordance with sfas and determined that there had been no impairment in its carrying value 
sfas also requires that negative goodwill be reversed immediately 
upon adoption of sfas in  bh acquisition reversed its negative goodwill into earnings and presented it as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
during  castlewood holdings also took negative goodwill into earnings upon the acquisition of three companies  and presented it as an extraordinary gain
