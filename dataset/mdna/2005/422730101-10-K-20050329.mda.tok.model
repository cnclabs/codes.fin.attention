the disclosures in this report related to prior periods have been restated to reflect the company s continuing operations 
critical accounting policies the presentation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting of the company s operating results and financial position 
the estimates and assumptions used in the company s financial statements are based upon management s evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances as of the time of the financial statements 
these estimates are often difficult  subjective and complex 
actual results could differ from the estimates 
hcc also gives accounting recognition to the actions of federal and state regulatory authorities where appropriate as prescribed by sfas no 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when earned  regardless of the period in which they are billed 
network access revenues are furnished in conjunction with interexchange carriers and are determined by cost separation studies and nationwide average schedules 
revenues include estimates pending finalization of cost studies 
network access revenues are based upon interstate tariffs filed with the federal communications commission by the national exchange carriers association and state tariffs filed with state regulatory agencies 
management believes recorded revenues are reasonable based on estimates of final cost separation studies  which are typically settled within two years 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate based on specifically identified problem accounts and historical collection experience 
specific accounts are evaluated where the company has information that the customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations  where payment is delinquent or where charges are in dispute 
reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as information affecting the accounts is received 
if circumstances change  recoverability of amounts due the company could be materially affected 
property  plant and equipment the company regularly reviews the carrying value of its fixed assets for impairment 
carrying values are estimated based on expected future cash flows and or established market valuations of other similar assets 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method based on the estimated useful lives of the various asset classes 
reserves established for asset retirement obligations have not been significant 
goodwill and intangible assets effective january  the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the provisions of this accounting standard  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized but are instead tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
the goodwill impairment test requires the company to determine the fair value of its reporting units 
the valuation is estimated based on access line and customer valuations and cash flow multiple valuations the company considers appropriate in the current marketplace 
if circumstances or assumptions supporting these estimates change  the carrying value of the company s goodwill could be materially affected 
income taxes the company estimates its income tax expense for each jurisdiction in which it operates 
the process includes apportioning the company s income among the jurisdictions  estimating current tax liabilities and establishing deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred taxes are calculated where the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are different for financial and tax reporting purposes 
valuation allowances are recorded in the tax accounts for amounts management believes may not be recoverable in future periods

effects of inflation the company s ability to accommodate expense increases due to inflation are constrained by the regulatory environment in which its pots segment operates 
the company s local exchange telephone companies are subject to the jurisdiction of minnesota  north dakota and wisconsin regulatory authorities with respect to a variety of matters  including rates for intrastate access services  the conditions and quality of service  issuance of debt  depreciation rates and accounting methods 
rates for local telephone service are not established directly by regulatory authorities  but their authority over other matters limits the company s ability to implement rate increases
