at december   the company s products are sold in the united states through a carefully selected base of accounts which fluctuates between  and  accounts  and  to  doors  depending on seasonality of summer and winter products 
oakley s store base is comprised of optical stores  sunglass retailers and specialty sports stores  including bike  surf  snow and golf shops  and motorcycle  athletic footwear and sporting goods stores and department stores 
the company also operates oakley retail stores in the united states that offer a full range of oakley products 
additionally  the company owns iacon  inc  a sunglass retailing chain headquartered in scottsdale  arizona  with sunglass specialty retail stores at december  internationally  the company sells its products through its direct offices in australia  brazil  canada  france  germany  italy  japan  mexico  new zealand  south africa and the united kingdom 
additionally  in those parts of the world not serviced by the company or its subsidiaries  oakley products are sold through distributors who possess local expertise 
these distributors sell the company s products either exclusively or with complementary products and agree to comply with the marketing philosophy and practices of the company 
sales to the company s distributors are denominated in us dollars 
the company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to transactions of its international subsidiaries 
the company and its subsidiaries use foreign exchange contracts to manage the level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
critical accounting policies the company s historical success is attributable  in part  to its introduction of products that are perceived to represent an improvement in performance over products available in the market 
the company s future success will depend  in part  upon its continued ability to develop and introduce such innovative products  although there can be no assurance of the company s ability to do so 
the consumer products industries are highly competitive and are subject to rapidly changing consumer demands and preferences 
the company competes with numerous domestic and foreign designers  brands and manufacturers of eyewear  apparel  apparel accessories  electronics  footwear and watches  some of which have greater financial and marketing resources than the company 
in order to retain its market share  the company must continue to be competitive in the areas of quality  technology  method of distribution  style  brand image  intellectual property protection and customer service 
these industries are subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect companies that misjudge such preferences 

table of contents in addition  the company has experienced significant growth under several measurements which has placed  and could continue to place  a significant strain on its employees and operations 
if management is unable to anticipate or manage growth effectively  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  the company is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the balance sheet dates and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods 
actual results could significantly differ from such estimates 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most significant accounting policies  which are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results 
revenue recognition the company recognizes wholesale revenue when merchandise is shipped to a customer and the risks and rewards of ownership and title have passed based on the terms of sale 
revenue from the company s retail store operations is recognized upon purchase by customers at the point of sale 
generally  the company extends credit to its wholesale customers and does not require collateral 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of those customers and historic credit losses have been within management s expectations 
sales agreements with dealers and distributors normally provide general payment terms of to days  depending on the product category and the customer 
the company s standard sales agreements with its customers do not provide for any rights of return by the customer other than returns for product warranty related issues 
in addition to these product warranty related returns  the company occasionally accepts other returns at its discretion 
the company records a provision for sales returns and claims based upon historical experience 
actual returns and claims in any future period may differ from the company s estimates 
accounts receivable the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by the company s review of their current credit information 
the company regularly monitors its customer collections and payments and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon the company s historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within the expectations and the provisions established by the company  there can be no assurances that the company will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that have been experienced in the past 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
the company regularly reviews its inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on the company s estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
demand for the company s products can fluctuate significantly 
factors that could affect demand for the company s products include unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors  which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction in the rate of reorders placed by retailers  continued weakening of economic conditions  which could reduce demand for products sold by the company and which could adversely affect profitability  and future terrorist acts or war  or the threat or escalation thereof  which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending  interrupt production and distribution of product and raw materials and  as a result  adversely affect the company s operations and financial performance 
additionally  management s estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate  which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 

table of contents long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 the company evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or change in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable 
under sfas no 
 the company estimates the future undiscounted cash flows derived from an asset to assess whether or not a potential impairment exists when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of a long lived asset may differ 
an impairment loss is recognized when the undiscounted future cash flows are less than its carrying amount 
the company uses its best judgment based on the most current facts and circumstances surrounding its business when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of a potentially impaired asset 
changes in assumptions used could have a significant impact on the company s assessment of recoverability 
numerous factors  including changes in the company s business  industry segment or the global economy could significantly impact management s decision to retain  dispose of or idle certain of its long lived assets 
at december   the company determined that no impairment loss was necessary 
goodwill in accordance statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  sfas no 
 goodwill and non amortizing intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are tested for impairment annually and also tested in the event of an impairment indicator 
as required by sfas no 
 the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill based on a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
fair value is determined based on estimated future cash flows  discounted at a rate that approximates the company s cost of capital 
such estimates are subject to change and the company may be required to recognize impairment losses in the future 
the company completed its annual impairment test for the fiscal year ended december   and determined that no impairment loss was necessary 
warranties the company provides a one year limited warranty against manufacturer s defects in its eyewear 
all authentic oakley watches are warranted for one year against manufacturer s defects when purchased from an authorized oakley watch dealer 
footwear is warranted for days against manufacturer s defects  and apparel is warranted for days against manufacturer s defects 
oakley electronic products are warranted for days against manufacturer s defects 
the company s standard warranties require the company to repair or replace defective product returned to the company during such warranty period with proof of purchase from an authorized oakley dealer 
the company maintains a reserve for its product warranty liability based on estimates calculated using historical warranty experience 
while warranty costs have historically been within the company s expectations  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs as in prior years 
a significant increase in product return rates  or a significant increase in the costs to repair product  could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results 

table of contents income taxes current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company considers future taxable income and ongoing  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of its deferred tax assets 
if the company determines that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized  the company will reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value  thereby decreasing net income 
evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on the company s judgment 
if the company subsequently determined that the deferred tax assets  which had been written down  would be realized in the future  the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased  thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made 
the company believes it has adequately provided for income tax issues not yet resolved with federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
at december   million was accrued for such matters 
although not probable  the most adverse resolution of these issues could result in additional charges to earnings in future periods 
based upon a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances  the company does not believe the ultimate resolution of tax issues for all open tax periods will have a materially adverse effect upon its results of operations or financial condition 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
insurance coverage the company is partially self insured for its workers compensation insurance coverage 
under this insurance program  the company is liable for a deductible of  for each individual claim and an aggregate annual liability for claims incurred during the period of  the company records a liability for the actuarially estimated cost of claims both reported  and incurred but not reported based upon its historical experience 
the estimated costs include the estimated future cost of all open claims 
the company will continue to adjust the estimates as its actual experience dictates 
a significant change in the number or dollar amount of claims or other actuarial assumptions could cause the company to revise its estimate of potential losses and affect its reported results 
foreign currency translation the company has direct operations in australia  brazil  canada  france  germany  italy  japan  mexico  new zealand  south africa and the united kingdom  which collect at future dates in the customers local currencies and purchase finished goods in us dollars 
accordingly  the company is exposed to transaction gains and losses that could result from changes in foreign currency 
assets and liabilities of the company denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rate for the period 
gains and losses from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
gains and losses on short term intercompany foreign currency transactions are recognized as incurred 
as part of the company s overall strategy to manage its level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  the company and its subsidiaries have entered into various foreign exchange contracts in the form of forward contracts 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents certain risks and uncertainties vulnerability due to supplier concentrations the company has an exclusive agreement with a single source for the supply of uncoated lens blanks from which a majority of its sunglass lenses are cut 
this agreement gives the company the exclusive right to purchase decentered sunglass lenses in return for the company s agreement to fulfill all of its lens requirements from such supplier  subject to certain conditions 
the company has expanded its in house lens blank production capabilities to manufacture some portion of its lenses directly 
in addition  the company has terminated this agreement effective in march and is renegotiating a new contract under terms it believes will be more favorable to the company 
in the event of the loss of its source for lens blanks  the company has identified an alternate source that may be available 
the effect of the loss of any of these sources including any possible disruption in business will depend primarily upon the length of time necessary to find and use a suitable alternative source and could have a material adverse impact on the company s business 
there can be no assurance that  if necessary  an additional source of supply for lens blanks or other critical materials could be located or developed in a timely manner 
if the company were to lose the source for its lens blanks or other critical materials  it could have a materially adverse effect on the company s business 
vulnerability due to customer concentrations net sales to the retail group of luxottica  which include sunglass hut locations worldwide  were approximately  and of the company s net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
luxottica is also one of the company s largest competitors in the sunglass and optical frame markets 
in december  the company and luxottica entered into a new commercial agreement that establishes the commercial terms applicable for between the two companies 
there can be no assurances as to the future of the relationship between the company and luxottica or as to the likelihood that a new contract beyond will be agreed to by the parties 
in october  luxottica acquired cole  one of the largest optical retailers and chain providers of managed vision care services worldwide 
the company currently sells to a small portion of cole s retail locations and sales to this customer have been immaterial to the company s operations 
in november  luxottica completed the acquisition of new zealand eyewear retailer ssnz  the company s largest customer in new zealand 
ssnz operates in new zealand with retail locations that offer some of the company s products and sales to this customer have been immaterial to the company s operations 
in september  luxottica acquired all the shares of australian eyewear retailer opsm 
opsm operates in the south pacific and southeast asia regions with approximately retail locations  a portion of which currently offer some of the company s products 
for  the company s net sales to opsm prior to the acquisition were approximately aud million or approximately us million based on the average exchange rate for 
these sales exclude a limited amount of sales generated through the company s international distributors 
there can be no assurance that the recent acquisitions or future acquisitions by luxottica will not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
dependence on key personnel the company s operations depend to a great extent on the efforts of its key executive officers and other key qualified personnel  many of whom would be extremely difficult to replace 
the loss of those key executive officers and qualified personnel may cause a significant disruption to the company s business and could adversely affect the company s operations 

table of contents competition the consumer products industries are highly competitive and are subject to rapidly changing consumer demands and preferences 
the company competes with numerous domestic and foreign designers  brands and manufacturers of eyewear  apparel  apparel accessories  electronics  footwear and watches  some of which have greater financial and marketing resources than the company 
management believes that its success depends in large part upon its ability to anticipate  gauge and respond to changing consumer demands in a timely manner and to continually appeal to consumers of the oakley brand 
increased competition in the worldwide apparel and footwear industries could reduce the company s sales and prices and adversely affect its business and financial condition 
changes in fashion trends the eyewear  apparel  apparel accessories  electronics  footwear and watch industries are characterized by constant product innovation due to changing consumer preferences 
as a result  the company s success depends in large part on its ability to continuously develop  market and deliver innovative and stylish products at a pace  intensity  and price competitive with other brands 
if the company fails to regularly and rapidly develop innovative products and update core products or if fashion trends shift away from the company s products  or if the company otherwise misjudges the market for its product lines  the company may be faced with a significant amount of unsold finished goods inventory and could adversely affect retail and consumer acceptance of the company s products  limit sales growth or other conditions which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
protection of proprietary rights the company relies in part on patent  trade secret  unfair competition  trade dress  trademark and copyright law to protect its right to certain aspects of its products  including product designs  proprietary manufacturing processes and technologies  product research and concepts  and recognized trademarks  all of which the company believes are important to the success of its products and its competitive position 
there can be no assurance that any pending trademark or patent application will result in the issuance of a registered trademark or patent  or that any trademark or patent granted will be effective in thwarting competition or be held valid if subsequently challenged 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the actions taken by the company to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent imitation of its products  that the company s proprietary information will not become known to competitors  that the company can meaningfully protect its right to unpatented proprietary information or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent or better products that do not infringe on the company s intellectual property rights 
no assurance can be given that others will not assert rights in  and ownership of  the patents and other proprietary rights of the company 
also  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect the company s intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
consistent with the company s strategy of vigorously defending its intellectual property rights  oakley devotes substantial resources to the enforcement of patents issued and trademarks granted to the company  to the protection of trade secrets  trade dress or other intellectual property rights owned by the company  and to the determination of the scope or validity of the proprietary rights of others that might be asserted against the company 
a substantial increase in the level of potentially infringing activities by others could require the company to increase significantly the resources devoted to such efforts 
in addition  an adverse determination in litigation could subject the company to the loss of its rights to a particular patent  trademark  copyright or trade secret  could require the company to grant licenses to third parties  could prevent the company from manufacturing  selling or using certain aspects of its products  or could subject the company to substantial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 

table of contents risks relating to international operations sales outside the united states accounted for approximately  and of the company s net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
while the company expects international sales to continue to account for a significant portion of its sales  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or increase its international sales 
the company s international operations and international commerce are influenced by many factors  including currency exchange rate fluctuations or restrictions  local economic and political instability  wars  civil unrest  acts of terrorism and other conflicts  natural disasters  changes in legal or regulatory requirements affecting foreign investment  loans  tariffs and taxes  and less protective foreign laws relating to intellectual property  the occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict the company s ability to operate in the affected region and or decrease the profitability of its operations in that region 
nature of endorsement contracts a key element of the company s marketing strategy has been to establish contacts with  and obtain endorsement from  prominent athletes and public personalities 
management believes that this has proven an effective means of gaining international brand exposure and broad product appeal 
these endorsement contracts generally have terms from one to four years 
the company also furnishes its products at a reduced cost or without charge to selected athletes and personalities who wear oakley glasses without any formal arrangement 
there can be no assurance that any of these relationships with athletes and personalities will continue  that such contracts will be renewed or that the company will be able to attract new athletes to wear or endorse its products 
if oakley were unable in the future to arrange endorsements of its products by athletes and or public personalities on terms it deems reasonable  it would be required to modify its marketing plans and could be forced to rely more heavily on other forms of advertising and promotion  which might not prove to be as effective as endorsements 
control by principal shareholder the company s current chairman and chief executive officer  jim jannard mr 
jannard  beneficially owned approximately of the outstanding common stock of the company at february  consequently  mr 
jannard has majority control of the company and the ability to control the election of directors and the results of other matters submitted to a vote of shareholders 
such concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the company 
possible volatility of stock price the market price for shares of the company s common stock may be volatile and may fluctuate based upon a number of factors  including  without limitation  business performance  news announcements or changes in general market conditions 

table of contents factors that may have a significant impact on the market price of the company s stock include receipt of substantial orders or order cancellations of products  quality deficiencies in services or products  international developments  such as technology mandates  political developments or changes in economic policies  changes in recommendations of securities analysts  shortfalls in the company s revenues or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by securities analysts or projected by the company  government regulations  including stock option accounting and tax regulations  energy blackouts  acts of terrorism and war  widespread illness  proprietary rights or product or patent litigation  strategic transactions  such as acquisitions and divestitures  or rumors or allegations regarding the company s financial disclosures or practices 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
due to changes in the volatility of the company s stock price  the company may be the target of securities litigation in the future 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
impact of potential future acquisitions from time to time  the company may engage in strategic transactions with the goal of maximizing shareholder value 
management will continue to evaluate potential strategic transactions and alternatives that it believes may enhance shareholder value 
these potential future transactions may include a variety of different business arrangements  including acquisitions  spinoffs  strategic partnerships  joint ventures  restructurings  divestitures  business combinations and equity or debt investments 
although management s goal is to maximize shareholder value  such transactions may impair shareholder value or otherwise adversely affect the company s business and the trading price of its stock 
any such transaction may require the company to incur non recurring or other charges and or to consolidate or record its equity in losses and may pose significant integration challenges and or management and business disruptions  any of which could harm the company s operating results and business 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nyse rules  are creating uncertainty for companies 
these new or changed laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity  and as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies  which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
the company is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  management s efforts to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
in particular  management s efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related regulations regarding the required assessment of the company s internal controls over financial reporting and its external auditors audit of that assessment has required the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
management expects these efforts to require the continued commitment of significant resources 
further  the company s board members  chief executive 
table of contents officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties 
as a result  the company may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers  which could harm its business

during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a foreign exchange contract loss of million related to the repatriation of profits by the company s subsidiary in the united kingdom 
this type of foreign exchange loss is not expected to occur in the future as the company changed its hedging practice to exclude the repatriation of earnings  if the company should decide to do so  where there is no offsetting increase in gross margin

the adjustment could result in additional tax liability and penalties of approximately million 
the company is currently contesting this adjustment with the irs

see note reclassifications and note quarterly financial data 
historically  the company s aggregate sales have been highest in the period from march to september  the period during which sunglass use is typically highest in the northern hemisphere 
as a result  operating margins are typically lower in the first and fourth quarters  as fixed operating costs are spread over lower sales volume 
in anticipation of seasonal increases in demand  the company typically builds sunglass inventories in the fourth quarter and first quarter when net sales have historically been lower 
in addition  sales of other products  which generate gross profits at lower levels than sunglasses  are generally lowest in the second quarter 
this seasonal trend contributes to the company s gross profit in the second quarter  which historically has been the highest of the year 
although the company s business generally follows this seasonal trend  new product category introductions  such as apparel  footwear  watches and electronics  and the company s retail and international expansion  have partially mitigated the impact of seasonality

at december   the company had a backlog of million  including backorders merchandise remaining unshipped beyond its scheduled shipping date of million  compared to a backlog of million  including backorders of million  at december  the increase in backlog reflects a substantial increase in apparel orders  modest new electronics orders and a small increase in goggles and watches  offset by declines in eyewear and footwear
