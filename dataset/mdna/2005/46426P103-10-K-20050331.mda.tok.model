item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations a note concerning forward looking statements the discussion below contains certain forward looking statements that reflect our current expectations regarding the company s future results of operations  performance and achievements 
please see the discussion of such forward looking statements under forward looking statements in item above 
overview the company has shifted from manufacturing in house to an outsourced manufacturing model wherein the company supplies raw materials to external parties and products are then completed 
this system allows for the company to outsource procurement in the future if it chooses to do so 
manufacturing partners then produce to specification with company personnel on hand to assist with quality control 
the company s products are designed for efficient production in this manner  emphasizing solid state electronics over mechanical devices with moving parts 
the decrease in cost associated with these developments  coupled with enhanced product functionality  has allowed the company to realize improved margins and significantly reduced overhead costs 
extensions of developed technology  based on substantial input from customers  have allowed the company to launch the rf product family and consider additional solutions while controlling total r d cost 
the company has announced several significant recent events  both during and early  such as the resolution of the patent litigation  increased sales order quantities entering  and the extension of its credit line debt maturity date from april to april despite these improvements  the wireless telecommunications industry is subject to risks beyond the company s control that can negatively impact customer capital spending budgets as occurred during and or spending patterns as occurred during 
for these and other reasons  the company s financial statements have been prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern 
as an after market vendor  the company s revenue has been sporadic  consistent with buying patterns of planning processes within wireless telecommunications carriers 
in the past there has been a fourth quarter effect  wherein operators were forced to spend remaining budget or lose it going forward 
with the advent of significant projects such as data networks  funds are often reallocated between periods and thus diminish the pool of funds available for normal activities 
the company s objective is to be included in these projects  and thus realize a higher  more stable revenue stream 

table of contents results of operations years ended december  and the company s net sales decreased  or  from  in to  in  as a result of an industry wide reduction in capital expenditures  particularly during the first half of  in favor of next generation systems generally to be deployed during and beyond

the cost of products sold for and consisted of direct material  labor and overhead costs associated with the products that were shipped during the period  as well as other costs consisting primarily of allocated overhead costs 
the company expects the cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue to decrease during due to anticipated revenue increases and related efficiencies  certain cost control initiatives including supply chain management  and primarily due to the continued emphasis on outsourcing the manufacture of its products 
in absolute terms  the company expects the total cost of products sold expense to increase during due to the expectation of higher revenues 
the company s internally funded research and development expenses increased by  or  from  in to  during this increase was due to the need to deploy resources in order to launch new products  particularly within the rf product family  and broadly to support new product and next generation development for future release 
the company expects these costs to increase slightly during in connection with the development of new products 
selling and marketing expenses increased  or  from  during to  during this increase was due to the addition of additional resources in this area  as well as the expansion of marketing programs 
the company expects these costs to increase during  consistent with expected increases in revenue 
general and administrative expenses decreased  or  from  in to  during this decrease was due to the reduction in expenses in the patent litigation as described elsewhere in this report  as well as the classification of  in legal settlement expenses during that did not exist during the company expects general and administrative expenses to decrease further during due to reduced litigation expenses 
interest income increased  or  from  in to  during this increase was due to the timing of payments and funding from the credit line 
while operating under its uncommitted line of credit from october and beyond  the company has not maintained  and does not expect to maintain  significant amounts of cash on which interest may be earned 
interest and warrant expense decreased  or  from  in to  during the company borrowed million during the fourth quarter of under an uncommitted line of credit with entities affiliated with its two largest shareholders 
the company borrowed additional monies under this line and related supplements during and as a result of the borrowings on this line during  million warrants were issued 
these warrants were ultimately converted into million shares of the company s common stock during february the interest expense recorded during includes  of non cash expense related to these warrants 
the company has reclassified into general and administrative costs a previously reported other expense item of  that was accrued as of december  as a contingent liability for the laves litigation settlement

table of contents cost of products sold decreased  or from  in to  in this occurred despite only a decrease in revenue  as a result of various cost control measures adopted during the preceding two years  including the continued emphasis on outsourcing manufacturing processes and the focus on profitable business  and the nature and value of products sold ie  the reduced sales of hts products and increased sales of anf and rf products 
the cost of products sold for and consisted of direct material  labor and overhead costs associated with the products that were shipped during the period  as well as other costs consisting primarily of allocated overhead costs 
the company s internally funded research and development expenses decreased by  or  from  in to  during these reductions were primarily due to the shift from initial development to product improvement and related product expansion as the focus of development efforts 
the emphasis on new products with a greater probability of profitable near term commercial sales also was significant in this reduction 
selling and marketing expenses decreased  or  from  during to  during this decrease was due to cost reductions implemented during the past year  including the reduction of certain personnel and the redeployment of resources into more targeted  direct marketing and selling campaigns 
general and administrative expenses decreased  or  from  in to  during this decrease was due to the reduction in expenses in the patent litigation as described elsewhere in this report  which more than offset an increase in non cash employee compensation and the settlement of the laves litigation during interest income decreased  or  from  in to  during this decrease was due to the timing of the credit line october 
the company became infused with cash during february after its shareholder rights offering  increasing interest income during while operating under its uncommitted line of credit from october and beyond  the company has not maintained  and does not expect to maintain  significant amounts of cash on which interest may be earned 
interest and warrant expense increased  or  from  in to  during during february  shareholder notes of  plus accrued interest  were repaid following the shareholder rights offering  both of which are described elsewhere in this document 
the company borrowed million during the fourth quarter of under an uncommitted line of credit with entities affiliated with its two largest shareholders 
the company borrowed an additional million under this line and a related supplement during as a result of the borrowings on this line  million warrants were issued 
the interest expense recorded during includes  of non cash expense related to these warrants 
other comparative results during the company recorded million of other expense 
this amount was comprised of a litigation settlement in the siegler case of million as well as approximately million from certain restructuring costs from the consolidation of facilities 
liquidity and capital resources the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern 
as discussed in note to the financial statements  the company incurred a net loss of million during the year ended december   and  as of that date  the company s accumulated deficit is million 
in addition  the company has consistently used  rather than provided  cash in its operations 
these factors  among others  as discussed in note to the financial statements  raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the company has been engaged in developing new solutions  and toward that end development spending has preceded sales revenues 
management s plans in regard to these matters include the focusing of development efforts on products with a greater probably of commercial sales  reducing professional fees and discretionary expenditures and increased efficiencies and reduced overhead costs associated with its outsourced production model  all of which are also described in note the financial statements do not include any adjustments  including any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
significant uses of cash during include personnel costs  the cost to produce inventory  legal costs primarily related to the patent appeal  facility related costs  and other uses 
significant sources of cash during include sales and the resulting realization of customer receivables  the draw of million on the credit line  and the exercise of million in warrants 

table of contents in view of the matters described in the preceding paragraph  recoverability of a major portion of the recorded asset amounts shown in the accompanying balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations of the company  which in turn is dependent upon the company s ability to meet its financing requirements on a continuing basis  to maintain present financing  and to succeed in its future operations 
at december   the company s cash and cash equivalents  excluding restricted certificates of deposit  were  an increase of  from the december  balance of  the continuing development of  and expansion in  sales of the company s rf product lines  as well as the continued defense of its intellectual property  may require a commitment of funds to undertake product line development and to market and sell its rf front end products 
the actual amount of the company s future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the amount and timing of future revenues  the level of product marketing and sales efforts to support the company s commercialization plans  the magnitude of its research and product development programs  the ability of the company to improve or maintain product margins  and the costs involved in protecting the company s patents or other intellectual property 
as of the date of this filing  the company believes that it has sufficient funds to operate its business as identified herein without the need for substantial future capital sources into the third quarter  and very possibly longer  subject to working capital and other requirements 
the company intends to look into augmenting its existing capital position potentially through other sources of capital 
for example  the company regularly reviews the capital markets for appropriate debt  equity and hybrid instruments in search of both adequate operating capital and the best available capital structure 
uncommitted line of credit as of the reporting date  the company had drawn million of debt financing under a credit line  as described below 
subsequent to the reporting date  during january  the company drew the remaining million on the line for a total debt of million 
during october  the company entered into an uncommitted line of credit with its two largest shareholders  an affiliate of elliott associates  lp manchester securities corporation and alexander finance  lp this line provided up to million to the company 
this line was uncommitted  such that each new borrowing under the facility would be subject to the approval of the lenders 
borrowings on this line bore an interest rate of and collateralized by all the assets of the company 
outstanding loans under this agreement would be required to be repaid on a priority basis should the company receive new funding from other sources 
additionally  the lenders were entitled to receive warrants to the extent funds were drawn down on the line 
the warrants bore a strike price of per share of common stock and were to expire on april  the credit line was to mature and be due  including accrued interest thereon  on march  due to an agreement between the parties that did not provide warrants with respect to the more recent million in borrowings  thus million warrants were issued as a result of this transaction 
during february  the warrant holders exercised all of their warrants  contributing million to the company in exchange for million shares of common stock 
according to existing accounting pronouncements and sec guidelines  the company allocated the proceeds of these borrowings between their debt and equity components 
as a result of these borrowings during  the company recorded a non cash charge of million through the outstanding term of the warrants april  
the final  of that amount was recorded during during october the company entered into an agreement with its lenders to supplement the credit line with an additional million  million of which was drawn immediately and million available to be drawn upon the company s request and subject to the approval of the lenders 
this supplemental facility bore a rate of interest and was due october  unlike the previous credit line  the supplemental facility did not include any stock warrants 
the term of the previous credit line were not affected by this supplement  and as such the million borrowed under that line  plus accrued interest  remained due march  during february  these credit lines were extended to a due date of april  with interest after the initial periods to be charged at 
no warrants or other inducements were issued with respect to these extensions 
additionally  lenders exercised their million warrants during february  agreeing to let the company use the funds for general purposes as opposed to repaying debt 

table of contents during july  the company and its lenders agreed to increase the aggregate loan commitments under the credit line from  to  simultaneously  the company drew the remaining  of the financing 
during november  the company and its lenders agreed to increase the line of credit to up to an additional million to an aggregate loan commitment of  million of which was drawn immediately by the company with the remaining million available to be drawn upon the company s request and subject to the approval of the lenders 
the remaining million was subsequently drawn down in january during february  the consolidated credit line was extended to a due date of april  with interest for the extension period set at 
no warrants or other inducements were issued with respect to this extension 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the company s financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that its critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from product sales are generally recognized at the time of shipment and are recorded net of estimated returns and allowances 
revenues from services are generally recognized upon substantial completion of the service and acceptance by the customer 
the company has  under certain conditions  granted customers the right to return product during a specified period of time after shipment 
in these situations  the company establishes a liability for estimated returns and allowances at the time of shipment and makes the appropriate adjustment in revenue recognized for accounting purposes 
during  no revenue was recognized on products that included a right to return or otherwise required customer acceptance after december  the company has established a program which  in certain situations  allows customers or prospective customers to field test the company s products for a specified period of time 
revenues from field test arrangements are recognized upon customer acceptance of the products 
the company warrants its products against defects in materials and workmanship typically for a year period from the date of shipment  though these terms may be negotiated on a case by case basis 
a provision for estimated future costs related to warranty expenses is recorded when revenues are recognized 
at december  and  respectively  the company accrued  and  for warranty costs 
this warranty reserve is based on the cost to replace a percentage of products in the field at a given point  adjusted by actual experience 
returns and allowances were not significant in any period reported  and form a data point in establishing the reserve 
should this warranty reserve estimate be deemed insufficient  by new information  experience  or otherwise  an increase to warranty expense would be required 
goodwill and intangible assets during october of  the company completed the process of evaluating goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment under sfas no 
as the fair value of the enterprise  using quoted market prices for the company s common stock  exceeded the carrying amount  the goodwill was determined to be not impaired 
we assess the potential for impairment of the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
if we determine that the value of the intangible assets and goodwill may not be recoverable from future cash flows or otherwise  a write down of the value of the assets may be required 
we estimate the useful lives of our intangible assets and amortize the value over the estimated life 
if the actual useful life is shorter than our estimated useful life  we will amortize the remaining book value over the remaining useful life or the asset may be deemed to be impaired and  accordingly  a write down of the value of the asset may be required 

table of contents allowance for doubtful receivables an allowance for doubtful receivables may be maintained for potential credit losses 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  on a client by client basis  when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful receivables including customer credit worthiness and current economic trends and records any necessary bad debt expense based on the best estimate of the facts known to date 
alternatives to this approach include applying a fixed and or empirical rate of bad debts to receivables 
as bad debts have historically been very low less than of revenue  such an empirical approach would have little impact on the reserve at december  further  the company believes its current method to be less arbitrary and more reliable than the alternatives as described 
should the facts regarding the collectability of receivables change  the resulting change in the allowance would be charged or credited to income in the period such determination is made 
such a change could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
compensation costs for employee stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the company s common stock at the date of grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
off balance sheet arrangements no such arrangements existed as of december   except for leases as described and the minimum lease payments as detailed in this document 
contractual obligations payments due by period year total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflect on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not have any material market risk sensitive instruments
