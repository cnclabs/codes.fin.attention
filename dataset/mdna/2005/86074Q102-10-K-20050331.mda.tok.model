item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes  included elsewhere in this report  and the information contained in selected financial and operating data 
executive summary stillwater mining company mines  processes  refines and markets palladium  platinum and minor amounts of other metals from the j m reef  an extensive trend of pgm mineralization located in stillwater and sweet grass counties in south central montana 
the company operates two mines stillwater and east boulder within the j m reef  each with substantial underground operations and a surface mill and concentrator 
concentrates produced at the two mines are shipped to the company s smelter and base metals refinery at columbus  montana  where they are further processed into a pgm filter cake that is sent to third party refiners for final processing 
most finished platinum and palladium produced from mining is sold under contracts with three major automotive manufacturers for use in automotive catalytic converters 
catalytic converters are a principal application for pgms 
in late  the company entered into a long term agreement to more fully utilize surplus capacity in the company s processing and refining facilities by extracting and recycling pgms from spent catalytic converters 
the company also has spot purchase and tolling arrangements with other suppliers of spent catalytic materials 
this recycling activity expanded significantly during  and by year end the company was processing these secondary materials at a rate of about nine tons per day 
in february  the company entered into sales agreements to sell the  ounces of finished palladium that it received in june as partial payment for a purchase of company shares by norilsk nickel 
these palladium sales will take place ratably over a two year period ending in the first quarter of two overriding factors heavily influence the company s profitability the volatility of pgm prices and the company s cost structure 
metal prices are dictated by market forces and so are beyond the direct control of the company  although market effects can be mitigated through long term sales agreements and at times through hedging activities 
several other major pgm producers in the mining industry either produce pgms as a byproduct of other refining or enjoy ores with a substantially higher proportion of the historically higher priced platinum over palladium 
the company does not enjoy these advantages and has a higher cost structure than many of its competitors  putting it at a disadvantage when prices are low 
the company s unit costs generally are affected by the level of ore production  by the consistency and quality of the ore mined  by the mining method  and by overall operating efficiency 
the company spends substantial amounts of development capital each year in the mines to sustain ongoing production 
in view of these challenges  minimizing unit operating costs in a safe and efficient manner is the principal operating focus of the company 
in  the company entered into three long term sales contracts with automobile manufacturers that commit most of the mines platinum and palladium production through while two of these contracts will expire before  the terms of the third contract provide for it to absorb the share of production made available by the expiring agreements 
these contracts all have floor prices see note to the company s consolidated financial statements that  in the recent low price environment for palladium  have been of significant benefit in allowing the company to continue operating profitably 
unless these contracts are extended or modified  as to which there can be no assurance  all three contracts will have expired by the end of at that time  the company could be fully exposed to market prices and the absence of these contracts after could materially affect the company s operating results 
as of december   the company had secured platinum prices in the forward market by entering into financially settled forward transactions covering over half of the company s anticipated platinum mine production for and specifically involving the period from january through october 
the company believes that the current disparity between palladium and platinum prices may narrow if consumers switch from using platinum to palladium  driven by the historically high platinum price  for existing and new applications 
the company notes that the price of platinum could weaken if this switching occurs and has secured the price on a portion of future sales 
as of december   the company had open financially settled forward contracts covering a total of  ounces of platinum at an overall average price of about per ounce 
the hedges are expected to modestly reduce the overall volatility of the company s earnings and cash flow 
under these hedging arrangements  in return for protection against downward movements in the platinum price  the company gives up the benefit of increases in the platinum price on the hedged ounces 
the company realized losses on financially settled forward sales of its mined platinum during of million 

table of contents volatility of pgm prices has caused the company significant concerns in the past 
the decision to build the second mine  known as east boulder  along the j m reef was made in  at a time when the palladium price was rising and widely expected to continue higher 
the east boulder facilities were largely financed through available cash and through bank borrowings that were expected to be repaid as mine production came on line 
however  as the project proceeded  the cost of construction overran initial estimates and at the same time palladium prices dropped  leaving the company over leveraged 
ultimately  in the fall of  the company was forced to slow down development at east boulder in order to avoid depleting its available cash 
following this slowdown  for a time the company s financial position remained precarious 
in early  stillwater secured million of additional equity funding through a private offering of its common stock 
the company also revisited its mining plans in an effort to optimize production and minimize costs in light of financial limitations 
recognizing that these efforts alone would not be sufficient to resolve the company s financial problems  the company s board of directors considered various strategic options 
this process led to the transaction  announced in november and closed in june  whereby norilsk nickel acquired of the company for million in cash and  ounces of palladium  through the purchase of newly issued stillwater common shares 
during the third quarter of  norilsk nickel subsequently completed a public cash tender offer for additional shares  increasing its ownership interest to the company was obligated by its banks to utilize million of the cash proceeds from the norilsk nickel transaction to reduce bank debt 
during the first quarter of  the company entered into contracts to sell the  ounces of palladium received from norilsk nickel to daimlerchrysler  mitsubishi and engelhard corporation 
the palladium is being sold in equal monthly quantities over two years at a slight volume discount to market prices at the time of sale 
during  the company sold approximately  ounces of this palladium  leaving approximately  ounces remaining in inventory at december  as discussed below  the company expects to utilize a portion of the cash proceeds from these sales to reduce its long term debt 
on august   the company entered into a new million credit facility  which replaced the company s previous credit facility 
the new credit facility consists of a million six year term loan facility maturing july   bearing interest at a variable rate plus a margin libor plus basis points  or approximately at december  and a million five year revolving credit facility expiring july  the revolving credit facility  when drawn  bears interest at a variable rate libor plus basis points or approximately at december  
the margin on the revolving credit facility adjusts contractually  based on the leverage ratio  as defined  beginning after the first quarter of proceeds of the new term loan facility were applied to pay off the previous credit facility and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes 
the million revolving credit facility includes a letter of credit facility that has been partially utilized to secure a million letter of credit provided as surety for certain of the company s reclamation obligations 
the undrawn amounts through the letter of credit facility carry a fee at an annual rate equal to the revolving credit margin as of december  plus 
the remaining unused portion of the revolving credit facility million at december  carries an annual commitment fee of 
the new credit agreement contains customary financial and other covenants  however  unlike the company s previous credit facility it does not include a minimum production covenant 
for the first and second quarters of  the company secured waivers of the minimum production covenant from the lenders under the previous credit facility 
the new credit facility requires that the company remit of the proceeds from sales of the palladium inventory received in the norilsk nickel transaction as prepayment against the new credit facility each time a certain cumulative level of such sales is reached 
as of december   the company had prepaid million related to sales of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction and had accumulated million toward the next prepayment 
the new credit facility also requires that of the company s annual excess cash flow as defined in the new credit agreement be offered as prepayment against borrowing under the new credit facility 
the company did not have excess cash flow and was not required to make any prepayments under this provision for the labor agreement covering the company s union employees at the stillwater mine and the columbus metal processing facilities expired at noon on july  the company and the union reached tentative agreement on a new labor agreement just prior to expiration and extended the contract expiration until noon on july   in order to allow time for the union membership to vote on the contract 
on july   the union leadership notified the company that a vote of their membership had rejected the proposed agreement  and accordingly the bargaining unit went on strike effective at noon on july  on july   the members of the union voted to approve a three year contract  which provides for a annual salary increase and a contract renewal cash bonus 
employees returned to work beginning with the day shift on july  costs directly associated with the union strike were approximately million 
in addition  the company estimates the production loss due to the strike at approximately  ounces of pgms 
despite the resolution of this strike  the company cannot assure that it will not encounter additional strikes or other types of conflicts with labor unions or employees in the future 
the labor agreement covering the company s union employees at the east boulder mine is scheduled to expire on june  
table of contents the company s primary focus will remain on improving profitability 
while this is largely a matter of reducing costs  management believes that there also may be opportunities to foster new demand  in particular for palladium 
during the company initiated the establishment of a palladium industry marketing effort made up of palladium producers and consumers to encourage research  provide education and develop new markets for palladium 
similar organizations already exist for platinum and other precious metals 
the company also collaborated in setting up a website  www 
stillwaterpalladium 
com  designed to provide information to industry and the general public 
management has met with various fabricators of palladium jewelry to encourage the growth of that business 
and the company has earmarked funds in to support a modest program of palladium research 
production as previously disclosed  the company is gradually increasing production at east boulder to  tons of ore per day 
while the company had planned to achieve this daily rate by the end of  several issues have been identified which will extend the ramp up period into the issues have centered on recognition that the developed state of the mine must be further advanced in order to achieve and maintain the higher production level 
the work on improving the developed state at the east boulder mine will include additional primary development to increase the number of ramp systems and working faces  additional diamond drilling associated with increased primary development  and development of a ventilation raise to surface to support a larger amount of equipment while improving underground air quality related to diesel particulate matter dpm 
ore production levels at east boulder averaged  tons of ore per day in  up from the  tons of ore per day average for full utilization of equipment at the mine will not be attained until after the completion of two new ventilation shafts  which is expected in early modest increases in production rates were planned at the stillwater mine during however  the loss of production during and immediately following the union strike more than offset any such gains 
the company s production levels for palladium and platinum are driven by the number of ore tons mined  the mill head grade of the ore and the metallurgical recovery percentages 
the company measures its net mine production in terms of the number of ounces contained in the mill concentrate  adjusted for subsequent processing losses expected to be incurred in smelting and refining 
the company defines an ounce of metal as produced at the time it is shipped from the mine site 
produced ounces also are adjusted for downstream estimated metal losses incurred in the smelting and refining processes 
depreciation and amortization costs are inventoried at each stage of production 
the grade of the company s ore reserves  measured in combined platinum and palladium ounces per ton  is a composite average of samples in all reserve areas 
as is common in underground mines  the grade mined and the recovery rate achieved varies depending on the area being mined 
in particular  mill head grade varies significantly between the stillwater and east boulder mines  as well as within different areas of each mine 
during  and  the average mill head grade for all tons processed from the stillwater mine was   and pgm ounces per ton of ore  respectively 
the east boulder mine commenced commercial production at the beginning of during  and the average mill head grade for all tons processed from the east boulder mine was  and pgm ounces per ton of ore  respectively 
during  the company s mining operations produced a total of  ounces of platinum and palladium  which included  ounces of palladium and  ounces of platinum 
pgm production decreased from  and was below the company s planned pgm production for the small decline in pgm production between and  is attributable to the production lost due to the brief labor strike the stillwater mine experienced in july the shortfall compared to the plan for resulted primarily from the strike and from the delay in increasing the east boulder production rate to  ore tons per day  as discussed above 
the company is targeting total mine production of between  and  pgm ounces for  reflecting a continuation through of the delay in expanding east boulder and a heavy emphasis at both mines on new development and reserve conversion during the year 
management believes this investment during will result in more efficient and productive mining operations over the longer term 
capitalized mine development mine development expenditures incurred to increase existing production  develop new orebodies or develop mineral property substantially in advance of production were capitalized and amortized using a units of production method 
mine development expenditures include shafts  surface adits and underground infrastructure development including footwall laterals  ramps rail and transportation  electrical and 
table of contents ventilation systems  shop facilities  material handling areas  ore handling facilities  dewatering and pumping facilities 
these facilities are required not only for current operations  but also as continuing infrastructure in support of all future planned operations 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company recorded an impairment charge of million at december  the carrying values of the stillwater mine  the east boulder mine and processing facilities in columbus  montana were each reduced to their fair market value 
as provided in sfas no 
 this adjusted carrying amount became the new cost basis for depreciation and amortization calculations as of december  the company calculates amortization of capitalized mine development costs by the application of an amortization rate to current production 
the amortization rate is based upon un amortized capitalized mine development costs  and the related ore reserves 
capital expenditures are added to the un amortized capitalized mine development costs as the related assets are placed into service 
in the calculation of the amortization rate  changes in ore reserves are accounted for  as a prospective change in estimate 
ore reserves and the further benefit of capitalized mine development costs are based on significant management assumptions 
any changes in these assumptions  such as a change in the mine plan or a change in estimated proven and probable ore reserves  could have a material effect on the expected period of benefit resulting in a potentially significant change in the amortization rate and or the valuations of related assets 
the company s proven ore reserves are generally expected to be extracted utilizing its existing mine development infrastructure 
additional capital expenditures will be required to access the company s estimated probable ore reserves 
these anticipated capital expenditures are not included in the current calculation of depreciation and amortization 
the company changed its accounting method for amortizing capitalized mine development costs in the fourth quarter of these mine development costs include the initial costs incurred to gain primary access to the ore reserves  plus the ongoing development costs of footwall laterals and ramps driven parallel to the reef that are used to access and provide support for the mining stopes in the reef 
prior to  the company amortized all such capitalized development costs at its mines over all proven and probable reserves at each mine 
following the asset impairment write down at the end of  the company revisited its assumptions and estimates for amortizing capitalized mine development costs 
the company concluded to continue amortizing the cost of all of the mine development that had been placed in service through over all proven and probable reserves  because in management s view these remaining unamortized costs related to infrastructure that would be used for the entire life of the mine 
however  for development placed in service after  the company concluded to use a shorter life  amortizing the cost of this new development over only the ore reserves in the immediate and relevant vicinity of the new development 
this approach was reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements for the first three quarters of following a review of its filings by the sec  the company recently determined it would change its method of accounting for development costs as follows unamortized costs of the shaft at the stillwater mine and the initial development at the east boulder mine will continue to be treated as life of mine infrastructure costs  to be amortized over total proven and probable reserves at each location  and all ongoing development costs of footwall laterals and ramps  including similar development costs incurred before  are to be amortized over the ore reserves in the immediate and relevant vicinity of the development 
this change in accounting method required the company to measure the effect of the change at january   as if the new method of amortization had been used in all prior years 
the credit for the cumulative effect of the change for all years prior to of million  is shown as the cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss for the year ended december  the company also has reflected the effect of the new accounting method of amortization on the company s quarterly financial statements for each of the first three quarters of by amending its previously filed form q s 
because the change in accounting method is effective from january   the company is not required to amend its and annual reports 
the company s financial statements also include the pro forma effect of the accounting change on its and financial results 
the effect of this change in accounting method was to reduce previously reported earnings for the nine months ended september  by million  including a benefit of million attributable to the cumulative effect adjustment  and a charge of million attributable to additional amortization for the period 
expenditures incurred to sustain existing production and to access specific reserve blocks or stopes provide benefit to ore reserve production over limited periods of time secondary development and are charged to operations as incurred 
these costs include ramp and stope access excavations from primary haulage levels footwall laterals  stope material rehandling laydown excavations  stope ore and waste pass excavations and chute installations  stope ventilation raise excavations and stope utility and pipe raise excavations 
during  depreciation and amortization rates were affected by the impairment charge in that reduced the carrying value of the east boulder mine  the stillwater mine and the processing and other facilities  which in turn reduced their depreciation and amortization bases  and by the change in the accounting method  used to amortize capitalized mine development costs 
due to the change in accounting method certain capitalized mine development costs will be amortized over a shorter period  which the company expects to result in a higher amortization expense than the company has experienced in the past 
revenue under the terms of sales contracts and purchase orders received from customers  the company recognizes revenue when the product is in a refined and saleable form and title passes  which is typically when the product is transferred from the account of the company to the account of the customer 

table of contents the company s revenue and earnings are significantly influenced by worldwide market prices of palladium and platinum  which can be volatile and over which the company has little or no control 
sales to significant customers represented approximately  and of total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
although the company sells its metals to a small number of customers and brokers  the company could  if the need were to arise  readily sell its metal on a spot basis and at spot prices in any of various commodity markets throughout the world 
from time to time  the company has used basic hedging techniques involving fixed forwards  cashless put and call option collars and financially settled forwards 
the objective of such metals hedging transactions has been to secure firm prices for the company s pgm production  to benefit from price increases or to protect against price decreases on that portion of production that falls outside the range of the floor or ceiling prices embedded in the long term auto company contracts 
such hedging contracts also may preclude the company from obtaining the full benefit of increased market prices for its contracted metals 
hedging losses of million million loss on mine production and million gain on secondary processing were realized in  in no metals hedging gains or losses were realized  and hedging gains of million on mine production were realized see business and properties sales and hedging activities 
the company uses forward contracts and financially settled forwards to manage the potential negative effects of metal price volatility on its financial results 
during  the company entered into various fixed forwards and financially settled forward contracts that were accounted for as cash flow hedges 
at december   the company had hedging contracts in place covering  ounces of metal sales through october the company has credit agreements with its major trading partners that provide for margin deposits in the event that forward prices for metals exceed the company s hedge contract prices by a predetermined margin limit 
the company s revenues and ounces sold were as follows for the years ended december ounces of ounces of ounces of in thousands of palladium of platinum of other palladium platinum other mine production secondary processing sales of palladium received in norilsk nickel transaction and other total mine production secondary processing other total mine production secondary processing other total results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues were million in  compared to million in  a increase 
revenues from mine production were million in  compared to million in  an increase 
the increase in mine production revenues was primarily due to a combined average realized pgm price per ounce of in  compared to in  an increase  offset by a decrease in the quantity of metals sold of  ounces in compared to  ounces in attributable to lower production 
revenues from secondary processing were million in  compared to million in primarily due to an increase in 
table of contents the quantity of pgms sold of  ounces in  compared to  ounces in the increase was due to the company s long term sourcing agreement for spent catalytic materials entered into during the fourth quarter of revenues from sales of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction and other activities were million in  compared to million in sales of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction generated million in revenues during  due to the sale of approximately  ounces of palladium at an average realized palladium price of per ounce 
the company has approximately  ounces of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction remaining in inventory at december   that is expected to be sold monthly through the first quarter of there were no such sales during during  the company entered in certain sales contracts providing for the company to sell the palladium ounces received in the norilsk nickel transaction  along with certain quantities of platinum and rhodium purchased on the open market or produced from the company s mining operations 
excluding sales of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction  during the company recognized revenue of million under these sales contracts 
during  the company recognized revenues of million for metals purchased for resale under other contractual sale arrangements 
cost of metals sold 
cost of metals sold was million in  compared to million in  a increase 
the cost of metals sold from mine production was million in  compared to million in  a decrease 
the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in ounces sold offset in part by an increase in the company s cost of metals sold per ounce 
the increase in the company s cost of metals sold per ounce was primarily due to higher direct mining costs as result of production losses from the union strike at the stillwater mine and processing facilities during the third quarter of and higher royalty costs as a result of higher realized pgm prices in compared to those in these higher costs were offset by higher by product credits in the cost of metals sold from secondary processing was million in  compared to million in the increase was primarily due to the cost of acquiring and processing the increased ounces generated from the company s long term sourcing agreement for spent catalytic materials entered into during the fourth quarter of the cost of metals sold from sales of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction and other activities was million in  compared to million in the total cost of palladium sold from just those ounces received in the norilsk nickel transaction was million in  representing the sale of approximately  ounces of palladium at an average cost of per ounce 
there were no such sales during as discussed in revenues  the company entered into sales contracts in which required it to purchases metal from third parties in order to fulfill delivery commitments 
the cost of metals sold from activities under these contracts  excluding sales of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction  was million in during  the company incurred million in costs for the metals re sold under other contractual obligations 
during  the company s mining operations produced approximately  ounces of pgms  which included approximately  and  ounces of palladium and platinum  respectively  compared with approximately  ounces of pgms in  which included approximately  and  ounces of palladium and platinum  respectively  a year on year decrease in total pgm production 
the production decrease in is primarily due to the union strike at the stillwater mine and a decrease in consolidated mill head grade  partially offset by an increase in tons mined at the east boulder mine due to development efforts as the company continues to ramp up production to a planned rate of  ore tons per day 
the stillwater mine produced approximately  ounces of pgms in  compared with approximately  ounces of pgms in  a decrease 
the east boulder mine produced approximately  ounces of pgms in  compared with approximately  ounces of pgms in  a increase 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million in  compared to million in  a increase 
the increase is primarily due to the change in accounting method for the amortization of capitalized mine development costs see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the change  unamortized costs of the shaft at the stillwater mine and the initial development at the east boulder mine will continue to be treated as life of mine infrastructure costs  to be amortized over total proven and probable reserves at each location  and all ongoing development costs of footwall laterals and ramps  including similar development costs incurred before  will be amortized over the ore reserves in the immediate and relevant vicinity of the development 

table of contents general and administration 
general and administrative costs were million in  compared to million in  a increase 
the increase was primarily due to security and settlement costs associated with the union strike at the stillwater mine and processing facilities in the third quarter of loss on disposal on property  plant and equipment

impairment of property  plant and equipment 
during  the company recorded an impairment of its property  plant and equipment of million 
there was no corresponding asset impairment during interest income 
interest income was million in  compared to million in the increase was primarily due to million in interest income from prepayments made to a vendor under the company s long term sourcing agreement for spent catalytic materials and an increase in average cash and cash equivalent balances during compared to total income tax benefit provision 
the company has not recorded any income tax expense in  other than for certain state minimum taxes paid 
changes in the company s net deferred tax assets have been offset by the change in the related valuation allowance 
in  the company recorded a tax benefit of million  offset by a provision for valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets of million and a million reduction of deferred tax assets for net operating loss carry forwards not expected to be utilized as a result of the norilsk nickel transaction during year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues were million in  compared to million in  a decrease 
proceeds from secondary processing for and have been reclassified as revenues to conform to the presentation 
revenues from mine production were million in  compared to million in  a decrease 
the decrease in mine production revenues was primarily due to a combined average realized pgm price per ounce of in  compared to in  an decrease  and a decrease in the quantity of metals sold from  ounces in to  ounces in  attributable to lower production 
revenues from secondary processing were million in  compared to million in  a decrease  primarily due to a decrease in the quantity of recycled pgms sold from  ounces in to  ounces in cost of metals sold 
cost of metals sold was million in  essentially unchanged from million in costs from secondary processing for and have been reclassified to conform to the presentation 
the cost of metals sold from mine production was million in compared to million in  a increase 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in the company s cost of metals sold per ounce partially offset by the decrease in ounces sold the cost of metals sold from secondary processing was million in  compared to million in  a decrease  primarily resulting from the decrease in ounces sold 
during  the company s mining operations produced approximately  ounces of pgms  which included approximately  and  ounces of palladium and platinum  respectively  compared with approximately  ounces of pgm  which included approximately  and  ounces of palladium and platinum  respectively  during  or a year on year decrease in total pgm production

the company follows sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company reviews and evaluates its long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances 
table of contents indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
impairment is considered to exist if total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset 
future cash flows include estimates of recoverable ounces  pgm prices considering current and historical prices  long term sales contract prices  price trends and related factors  production levels  capital and reclamation expenditures  all based on life of mine plans and projections 
the company disclosed in its quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september   that a continuation of palladium prices  at then low levels  would lead to asset impairment writedowns and a reduction of ore reserves which could be material 
the company disclosed that the timing of such writedown or reduction in ore reserves would be evaluated in light of palladium prices and other matters 
ore reserves are determined on an annual basis  and concurrently  mine plans and operating budgets are updated 
at year end  the east boulder mine ore reserve had increased in contained ounces from that reported at year end however  the stillwater mine ore reserve at year end had decreased by in contained ounces from that reported at year end overall the company s estimated contained ounces declined by 
the year end decrease in ore reserves at the stillwater mine was viewed as a change in circumstances that prompted an impairment review of the carrying values of the company s mine properties 
the review determined that company investments in property  plant and equipment at the stillwater mine and east boulder mine were impaired 
consequently  the company engaged behre dolbear  independent valuation consultants  to perform a fair market value assessment of the assets at december  as a result  the company recorded an asset impairment charge of million reducing the carrying value of the properties to their fair market value  as required under sfas no 
the impairment charge consists of million at the stillwater mine  million at the east boulder mine and million at the processing and other facilities  reducing the carrying value of stillwater mine to million  east boulder mine to million and the processing and other facilities to million at december  behre dolbear utilized conventional mine valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis for purposes of determining fair market value 
the resulting net carrying value of the company s mining assets as of december  and is as follows before impairment impairment in thousands charge charge net book value net book value stillwater mine east boulder mine processing assets other assets assumptions underlying future cash flows are subject to risks and uncertainties 
any differences between projections and actual outcomes for key factors such as pgm prices  recoverable ounces  and or the company s operating performance could have a material effect on the company s determination of ore reserves  or its ability to recover the carrying amounts of its long lived assets  possibly resulting in additional impairment charges in the future 
norilsk nickel transaction related expenses 
norilsk nickel transaction related expenses of million represent costs incurred for professional services associated with the norilsk nickel transaction 
restructuring costs  net 
during  the company revised its estimate of accrued restructuring costs as a result of negotiations regarding certain termination clauses in construction contracts which had been cancelled 
the company made adjustments to reduce the accrual by million and million during and  respectively 
during  the company increased its restructuring accrual by million to reflect the decision to eliminate six management positions 
income taxes 
the company reported an income tax benefit of million or of pre tax loss for the year ended december   compared to an income tax provision of million for the year ended december  the tax benefit is comprised of a million benefit offset by a million provision for a valuation allowance of the amount of the company s net deferred tax assets 
the tax benefit is further offset by a reduction of deferred tax asset of million resulting from a limitation on the company s net operating loss carry forwards attributed to the ownership change resulting from the norilsk nickel transaction see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
this compares to an income tax provision of million  or of pre tax earnings for the year ended december  the change in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a reduction in taxable income from mining that limits the company s statutory depletion for tax purposes 

table of contents other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
for the year  other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  included a decline in the market value of commodity instruments of million and a decline in the market value of the interest rate swaps of million  offset by reclassification adjustments to interest expense of million 
for  other comprehensive loss of million net of tax included a decline in the market value on commodity instruments of million and a decline in the market value of the interest rate swaps of million 
other comprehensive loss in also includes reclassification adjustments to earnings of million associated with deferred gains on commodity instruments offset by million associated with losses on interest rate swaps 
liquidity and capital resources working capital at december  was million  compared to million at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december   compared to at december  for  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to and million for and the changes were primarily a result of year ended december  in thousands cash collected from customers cash paid to suppliers  employees  etc 
interest received interest paid net cash provided by operating activities the company s net cash flow from operating activities is affected by several key factors  including net realized prices for its products  cash costs of production  and the level of pgm production from the mines 
at the pgm price levels prevailing at december   absent separate hedging arrangements  a change in the price of platinum generally would flow through almost dollar for dollar to cash flow from operations  subject only to price ceilings on a small portion of the company s long term sales contracts  and certain costs severance taxes and royalties on mine production which adjust upward or downward with market prices 
under the company s long term sales contracts for mined production  a change in the market price of palladium  at prices prevailing on december   would not flow through to cash flow from operations  unless it was a large increase  as the market price for palladium was well below the price floors in the those contracts 
sales out of the palladium inventory received in conjunction with the norilsk nickel transaction are not subject to price floors  and therefore price changes related to sales of that inventory would directly affect cash flow from operations 
the company hedges the selling price of pgms in its recycling activity  so a change in the market price of platinum and palladium on sales of secondary recycling materials would have only a modest effect on margins earned from this activity and on cash flow from operations 
changes in the cash costs of production generally flow through dollar for dollar into cash flow from operations 
a reduction due to grade in total mine production of  or about  ounces per year  would reduce cash flow from operations by an estimated million per year at the price and cost levels prevailing at december  the company s forecasts indicate that such a reduction in mine production would not impair the company s ability to repay its outstanding debt or to maintain its planned level of capital expenditures  although a significantly larger reduction in mine production could adversely affect the company s financial position 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company s investing activities are primarily for capital expenditures of million  million and million in  and  respectively  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements

critical accounting policies mine development expenditures capitalization and amortization mining operations are inherently capital intensive  generally requiring substantial capital investment for the initial and concurrent development and infrastructure of the mine 
many of these expenditures are necessarily incurred well in advance of actual extraction of ore 
underground mining operations such as those conducted by the company require driving tunnels and sinking shafts that provide access to the underground orebody and construction and development of infrastructure  including electrical and ventilation systems  rail and other forms of transportation  shop facilities  material handling areas and hoisting systems 
ore mining and removal operations require significant underground facilities used to conduct mining operations and to transport the ore out of the mine to processing facilities located above ground 
contemporaneously with mining  additional development is undertaken to provide access to ongoing extensions of the orebody  allowing more ore to be produced 
in addition to the development costs that have been previously incurred  these ongoing development expenditures are necessary to access and support all future mining activities 
mine development expenditures incurred to date to increase existing production  develop new orebodies or develop mineral property substantially in advance of production are capitalized 
mine development expenditures consist of a vertical shafts  multiple surface adits and underground infrastructure development including footwall laterals  ramps  rail and transportation  electrical and ventilation systems  shop facilities  material handling areas  ore handling facilities  dewatering and pumping facilities 
many such facilities are required not only for current operations  but also for all future planned operations 
expenditures incurred to sustain existing production and access specific ore reserve blocks or stopes provide benefit to ore reserve production over limited periods of time secondary development and are charged to operations as incurred 
these costs include ramp and stope access excavations from primary haulage levels footwall laterals  stope material rehandling laydown excavations  stope ore and waste pass excavations and chute installations  stope ventilation raise excavations and stope utility and pipe raise excavations 
the company calculates amortization of capitalized mine development costs by the application of an amortization rate to current production 
the amortization rate is based upon un amortized capitalized mine development costs  and the related ore reserves 
capital expenditures are added to the un amortized capitalized mine development costs as the related assets are placed into service 
in the calculation of the amortization rate  changes in ore reserves are accounted for as a prospective change in estimate 
ore reserves and the further benefit of capitalized mine development costs are based on significant management assumptions 
any changes in these assumptions  such as a change in the mine plan or a change in estimated proven and probable ore reserves  could have a material effect on the expected period of benefit resulting in a potentially significant change in the amortization rate and or the valuations of related assets 
the company s proven ore reserves are generally expected to be extracted utilizing its existing mine development infrastructure 
additional capital expenditures will be required to access the company s estimated probable ore reserves 
these anticipated capital expenditures are not included in the current calculation of depreciation and amortization 

table of contents the company changed its accounting method for amortizing capitalized mine development costs in the fourth quarter of these mine development costs include the initial costs incurred to gain primary access to the ore reserves  plus the ongoing development costs of footwall laterals and ramps driven parallel to the reef that are used to access and provide support for the mining stopes in the reef 
prior to  the company amortized all such capitalized development costs at its mines over all proven and probable reserves at each mine 
following the asset impairment write down at the end of  the company revisited its assumptions and estimates for amortizing capitalized mine development costs 
the company concluded to continue amortizing the cost of all of the mine development that had been placed in service through over all proven and probable reserves  because in management s view these remaining unamortized costs related to infrastructure that would be used for the entire life of the mine 
however  for development placed in service after  the company concluded to use a shorter life  amortizing the cost of this new development over only the ore reserves in the immediate and relevant vicinity of the new development 
this approach was reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements for the first three quarters of following a review of its filings by the sec  the company recently determined it would change its method of accounting for development costs as follows unamortized costs of the shaft at the stillwater mine and the initial development at the east boulder mine will continue to be treated as life of mine infrastructure costs  to be amortized over total proven and probable reserves at each location  and all ongoing development costs of footwall laterals and ramps  including similar development costs incurred before  will be amortized over the ore reserves in the immediate and relevant vicinity of the development 
this change in accounting method required the company to measure the effect of the change at january   as if the new method of amortization had been used in all prior years 
the credit for the cumulative effect of the change for all years prior to of million  is shown as the cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss for the year ended december  the company also has reflected the effect of the new accounting method of amortization on the company s quarterly financial statements for each of the first three quarters of by amending its previously filed form q s 
because the change in accounting method is effective from january   the company is not required to amend its and annual reports 
the company s financial statements also include the pro forma effect of the accounting change on its and financial results 
the effect of this change in accounting method was to reduce previously reported earnings for the nine months ended september  by million  including a benefit of million attributable to the cumulative effect adjustment  and a charge of million attributable to additional amortization for the period 
the calculation of the amortization rate  and therefore the annual amortization charge to operations  could be materially impacted to the extent that actual production in the future is different from current forecasts of production based on proven and probable ore reserves 
this would generally occur to the extent that there were significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in determining ore reserves 
these factors could include an expansion of proven and probable ore reserves through development activities  differences between estimated and actual costs of mining due to differences in grade or metal recovery rates  and differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price assumptions used in the estimation of ore reserves 
asset impairment the company follows sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company reviews and evaluates its long lived assets for impairment when events and changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts of its assets may not be recoverable 
impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than carrying amount of the asset 
future cash flows include estimates of recoverable ounces  pgm prices considering current and historical prices  long term sales contracts prices  price trends and related factors  production levels and capital and reclamation expenditures  all based on life of mine plans and projections 
if the assets are impaired  a calculation of fair market value is performed  and if fair market value is lower than the carrying value of the assets  the assets are reduced to their fair market value 
assumptions underlying future cash flows are subject to risks and uncertainties 
any differences between projections and actual outcomes for key factors such as pgm prices  recoverable ounces  and or the company s operating performance could have a material effect on the company s determination of ore reserves  or its ability to recover the carrying amounts of its long lived assets  possibly resulting in additional impairment charges in the future see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company has reviewed the requirements of sfas no 
in conjunction with preparing its year end financial statements at december  this review included consideration of the company s reserve position  current prices for platinum and palladium  and the current state of operations at each of its mines 
the company concluded that as of december   there are no events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amounts of the company s assets may not be recoverable 
income taxes income taxes are determined using the asset and liability approach in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this method gives consideration to the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax rates 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
each quarter  management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
a valuation allowance has been provided at december   and december   for the portion of the company s net deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that they will not be realized see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
based on the company s current financial projections  and in view of the level of tax depreciation and depletion deductions available  it appears unlikely that the company will owe any income taxes for the foreseeable future 
however  if average realized pgm prices were to increase substantially in the future  the company could owe income taxes prospectively on the resulting higher taxable income 

table of contents post closure reclamation costs effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and normal use of the asset 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  the company will recognize a gain or loss on settlement 
under sfas no 
 accounting for reclamation obligations requires management to make estimates for each mining operation of future costs the company will incur to complete final reclamation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations 
actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated 
additionally  future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required to be performed by the company 
any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to operations for reclamation and remediation 
the company reviewed its sfas no 
assumptions at december   and has increased its asset retirement obligation asset and liability in view of the current regulatory climate 
the company s accrued reclamation liability was approximately million at december  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
any differences between the estimated amounts and actual post closure reclamation and site restoration costs could have a material effect on the company s estimated liability resulting in a change in the recorded amount 
derivative instruments from time to time  the company enters into derivative financial instruments  including fixed forwards  cashless put and call option collars and financially settled forwards to manage the effect of changes in the prices of palladium and platinum on the company s revenue 
the company accounts for its derivatives in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities which requires that derivatives be reported on the balance sheet at fair value and  if the derivative is not designated as a hedging instrument  changes in fair value must be recognized in earnings in the period of change 
if the derivative is designated as a hedge and to the extent such hedge is determined to be effective  changes in fair value are either a offset by the change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability if applicable or b reported as a component of other comprehensive income in the period of change  and subsequently recognized in the determination of net income in the period the offsetting hedged transaction occurs 
the company primarily uses derivatives to hedge metal prices and manage interest rate risk 
as of december   the outstanding derivatives associated with commodity instruments are valued at an unrealized loss of million  and are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
as of december   there were no outstanding interest rate swaps see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including the effects of adverse changes in metal prices and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk the company produces and sells palladium  platinum and associated by product metals directly to its customers and also through third parties 
as a result  financial risks are materially affected when prices for these commodities fluctuate 
in order to manage commodity price risk and to reduce the impact of negative fluctuation in prices  the company enters into long term contracts and uses various derivative financial instruments 
because the company hedges only with instruments that have a high correlation with the value of the hedged transactions  changes in the fair value of the derivatives are expected to be offset by changes in the value of the underlying commodities 
the company has entered into long term sales contracts with general motors corporation  ford motor company and mitsubishi corporation 
the contracts apply to the portions of the company s production over the period through december and include certain floor and ceiling price structures 
in the first quarter of the company also entered into sales agreements  under which all of the  ounces of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction will be sold  at a slight volume discount to market price at the time of delivery  over a period of two years  primarily for use in automobile catalytic converters 
see business and properties pgm sales and hedging activities and note to the company s consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of the company s open positions at december  from time to time  the company enters into fixed forwards and financially settled forward contracts that are accounted for as cash flow hedges 
under financially settled forwards  at each settlement date  the company receives the difference between the forward price and the market price if the market price is below the forward price and the company pays the difference between the forward price and the market price if the market price is above the forward price 
the company s financially settled forwards are settled at maturity 
metal produced from recycling spent catalytic material is sold forward at the time of receipt and delivered against cash flow hedges when the ounces are recovered 
during  the company also entered into financially settled forwards covering over covering approximately one half of its estimated mine production of platinum through october  at an overall average platinum price of about per ounce 
the unrealized loss on these instruments due to changes in metal prices at december  was million 
losses realized on commodity instruments related to mine production during totaled million 
a summary of the company s derivative financial instruments as of december   is as follows mine production financially settled forwards platinum average ounces price index first quarter  monthly london pm average second quarter  monthly london pm average third quarter  monthly london pm average fourth quarter  monthly london pm average first quarter  monthly london pm average second quarter  monthly london pm average third quarter  monthly london pm average fourth quarter  monthly london pm average catalyst recycling fixed forwards platinum palladium rhodium ounces price ounces price ounces price first quarter second quarter a period of continuous low commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on the calculation of the company s ore reserves as well as on the company s financial performance 
interest rate risk as of december   the company had million outstanding under its million credit facility  bearing interest at a variable rate of based upon libor at december  plus a margin see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
at the current libo rate  this represents an interest cost of approximately million per year 
although the margin on this debt is fixed  the libo rate is subject to short term fluctuations in market interest rates 
each increase in libo rate increases the company s estimated annual interest cost by approximately million 
as of december  the company has elected not to hedge its interest rate exposures  leaving the company fully exposed should short term interest rates increase significantly
