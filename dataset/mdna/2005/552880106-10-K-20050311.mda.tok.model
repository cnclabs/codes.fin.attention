item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary statements  of this form k 
the company does not intend to update any of the forward looking statements after the date of this form k to conform them to actual results 
item business overview mgi pharma  inc  we  mgi  or the company  is an oncology focused biopharmaceutical company that acquires  develops and commercializes proprietary pharmaceutical products that meet cancer patient needs 
it is our goal to become a leader in oncology through application of our three core competencies of oncology product acquisition  development and commercialization  which we apply toward our portfolio of oncology products and product candidates 
we acquire intellectual property or product rights from others after they have completed the basic research to discover the compounds that will become our product candidates or marketed products 
this allows us to focus our skills on product development and commercialization rather than directly performing drug discovery 
we currently market several cancer related pharmaceutical products in the united states using our person oncology focused sales organization 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations revenues for a breakdown of sales by product over the last three years 
we focus our sales efforts solely within the united states  where we have retained product rights to our currently marketed products and product candidates under development 
we have created alliances with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for the sale and marketing of our products in other countries 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on revenues attributable to us and foreign customers 
we began face to face sales calls or direct promotion of aloxi palonosetron hydrochloride injection in september in the united states for the prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting  or cinv 
sales of aloxi injection accounted for approximately percent of our million of product sales in we marketed salagen tablets pilocarpine hydrochloride in the united states to oncologists as a treatment for the symptoms of radiation induced dry mouth in head and neck cancer patients and to rheumatologists as a treatment for dry mouth associated with the autoimmune disease sj gren s syndrome 
beginning in december  generic milligram pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets entered the united states markets where salagen tablets compete and we have suspended direct promotion of salagen tablets 
if the introduction of these competing products adheres to the classic pattern of initial generic competition in a pharmaceutical product class  we would expect salagen tablets sales to decline significantly from our sales of million in the united states 
in march  we began direct promotion of hexalen capsules after acquiring the hexalen capsules business in november hexalen capsules are second line chemotherapy for ovarian cancer patients who are refractory to first line therapies 
on november   we and helsinn healthcare sa announced an expansion of our exclusive united states and canada license and distribution agreement to include rights for the post operative nausea and vomiting  or ponv  application of aloxi injection and an oral aloxi formulation 
phase trials of aloxi injection for prevention of ponv indicated that aloxi injection was safe and well tolerated 
we expect phase trials to begin in for use of aloxi injection in the prevention of ponv and aloxi capsules for the prevention of cinv 
in september  we began direct promotion of kadian morphine sulfate sustained release capsules in the united states to oncology health care professionals for moderate to severe pain associated with cancer  under a promotion arrangement with alpharma  inc kadian capsules continue to be marketed by alpharma to pain specialists in the united states  other than oncology health care professionals 
in september  we obtained exclusive worldwide rights to the development  commercialization  manufacturing and distribution of dacogen decitabine injection for all indications from supergen  inc dacogen injection is an investigational anti cancer therapeutic  which is currently in development for the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome  or mds 
the mds new drug application  or nda  and marketing authorization application  or maa  for dacogen injection were submitted and accepted for review by the food and drug administration  or fda  and european medicines agency  or emea  respectively 
the fda established a prescription drug user fee act  or pdufa  goal date for the nda of september  given the broad activity of dacogen injection in hematologic cancers  we also intend to initiate during a pivotal phase program in patients with acute myeloid leukemia  or aml 
saforis oral suspension is a late stage  novel  proprietary formulation of l glutamine  an amino acid critical to the repair of cellular damage 
saforis oral suspension decreased the duration and severity of chemotherapy induced inflammation of the tissues lining the mouth  or oral mucositis 
in  a phase trial of saforis oral suspension was completed in patients and it met its primary clinical objective of clinically significant reduction of oral mucositis in patients receiving saforis oral suspension compared to placebo 
a second phase trial is planned to begin in we are currently developing zyca as a treatment for young women with high grade cervical dysplasia 
in a recently completed phase  multicenter  randomized placebo controlled trial of women with high grade cervical dysplasia that was conducted in the united states and europe  zyca was shown to be safe and well tolerated 
in a prospectively defined cohort of patients under years of age  the drug promoted resolution of high grade dysplasia in percent of patients  versus percent in the placebo arm 
in all patients  resolution was percent for patients on drug and percent for patients on placebo 
a phase trial to further assess the safety and efficacy of zyca will begin in and is being designed to become a key part of submissions to regulatory authorities for seeking marketing approval 
irofulven  the lead cancer therapy product candidate from our proprietary family of compounds  called acylfulvenes  is in a series of clinical trials 
based on our analysis of results from our trials of irofulven  we believe that irofulven is adequately tolerated for a chemotherapeutic  with evidence of monotherapy activity against a wide range of cancers including prostate  liver  ovarian  and pancreatic tumors 
these results have been seen in patients with refractory tumors  meaning tumors that are unresponsive or no longer responsive to prior chemotherapy regimens 
we also are conducting a series of trials with irofulven in combination therapy with currently approved cancer agents 
we believe that an advantage of combination therapy is the potential to achieve better anti cancer benefit with an acceptable side effect profile compared to either agent used alone 
the most advanced of these combination trials is a phase  multi arm  randomized trial of irofulven in combination with capecitabine and prednisone in hormone refractory prostate cancer  or hrpc  patients previously treated with docetaxel 
most hrpc patients in the united states who are receiving chemotherapy are treated with docetaxel  and we believe significant unmet need exists among prostate cancer patients who have failed hormone therapy and who have progressed on docetaxel 
we believe we have a robust portfolio of oncology related product candidates 
our current product candidates are predominately in advanced stages of development and are intended to have diverse roles in treating cancer patients or cancer related conditions 
our portfolio includes therapeutic and supportive care product candidates

cancer overview according to the american cancer society  or acs  there are approximately million new cases of cancer diagnosed in the united states each year 
cancer is the second leading cause of death in the united states and is projected to result in approximately  deaths in the united states in cancer is characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells 
these abnormal or malignant cells accumulate and form tumors that can compress  invade and destroy normal tissue 
if malignant cells break away from the primary tumor  they can travel through the bloodstream or lymphatic system to other areas of the body where they may settle and form new tumors 
this spread of a tumor to a new site is called metastasis 
different types of cancer vary in their rates of growth and patterns of spread  and  consequently respond in varying degrees to different types of treatment 
the four most common forms of treatment for cancer in order of their typical use are surgery the physical removal of a patient s tumor mass  radiation therapy the use of high energy particles or waves  such as x rays or gamma rays  to destroy or damage cancer cells  chemotherapy the use of drugs to inhibit the growth of or kill cancer cells 
systemic chemotherapy results from cancer therapy drugs that are administered by injection or orally 
these drugs enter the bloodstream and can potentially reach all areas of the body  which make this treatment especially useful for cancer that has metastasized  and immunotherapy stimulation of a patient s immune system or administration of agents that work by an immune mediated mechanism  either directly or indirectly to inhibit the growth of or enhance the killing of cancer cells 
a cancer patient often receives a combination of treatments depending upon the type and extent of the disease 
while surgery attempts to remove localized cancer from the patient and radiation attempts to kill cancer cells  there are significant limitations and complications associated with these treatments that result in high rates of treatment failure 
this failure is due primarily to metastasis and dose limiting severe side effects 
chemotherapeutic agents attempt to address the limitations of surgery and radiation  which are local treatments  by interfering with the replication of cancer cells that may have spread to distant sites in the patient 
immunotherapy is a rapidly developing area of cancer treatment and is most often provided in combination with other cancer therapies 
in addition to treatment of their cancer  cancer patients often need supportive care to prevent or treat the side effects of radiation or chemotherapy 
examples include treatment of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting  oral mucositis  pain  and various anemias  or abnormally low blood cell counts 
cancer is a disease characterized by uncontrolled cell replication  which requires cells to first replicate their dna 
therefore  many chemotherapeutic agents attempt to interfere with cancer cells ability to replicate dna  or following the replication of their dna  the ability of the cancer cells to divide 
different classes of chemotherapeutic agents are distinguished by their mechanism of action or how they specifically interfere with the cancer cells ability to replicate dna or divide 
when a cancer cell s dna is sufficiently damaged by a chemotherapeutic agent  dna synthesis is inhibited or cell division is inhibited  and a cellular process known as apoptosis  or programmed cell death  may be activated 
apoptosis of tumor cells can lead to reduction in tumor size or to the arrest of tumor growth 
certain chemotherapeutic agents may act to directly promote apoptosis in tumor cells 
because different chemotherapeutic agents may target different cellular processes required for dna replication and cell division or apoptosis  chemotherapeutic agents are often used in combination to exploit potential synergy with different mechanisms of action  and minimize the side effect profile of the individual agents 
agents that specifically induce apoptosis or interfere with dna replication or cell division in novel ways are therefore excellent candidates to be used in combination with existing chemotherapy agents 
one of the principal causes of chemotherapy treatment failure is the development of drug resistance by cancer cells  where cancer cells become resistant or refractory to the intended cytotoxic action of a variety of conventional chemotherapeutic agents 
in many cases  resistance developed to a specific chemotherapeutic agent results in multi drug resistance where the cancer cell becomes resistant to a wide variety of chemotherapeutic agents 
given the current limitations of chemotherapy  there is a clear need for new therapies that are effective against a broad range of resistant and refractory cancers  as well as chemotherapeutics that act by novel mechanisms that can offer benefits as a combination therapy with existing chemotherapeutic agents 
reactivation of tumor suppressor genes that exist naturally in a patient s cells is an area of active research 
excessive methylation  or hypermethylation  can stop the expression of a tumor suppressor gene and production of the anti cancer protein it encodes 
this biological effect has been implicated as a fundamental factor in the development of cancers 
methylation is the attachment of a small cluster of carbon and hydrogen elements known as a methyl group 
attachment of a methyl group to a gene may stop its functioning 
researchers are identifying and evaluating ways to prevent or reverse hypermethylation  thereby allowing tumor suppressor genes to produce the natural proteins that can stop or reduce the growth of tumors 
standard response criteria are used to report the results of oncology clinical trials 
in solid tumor clinical trials  a complete response means that all measurable tumor tissue has disappeared and the patient appears to be disease free 
a partial response means that measurable tumor tissue has shrunk by at least percent in two dimensional measurements or percent in single dimensional measurements 
stable disease means that the size of the measurable tumor tissue has not shrunk sufficiently to be considered a partial response  but it has not grown more than percent from its smallest size during treatment 
progressive disease means that the tumor has grown by more than percent from its smallest size during treatment 
achieving agreement on the appropriate clinical measures to use in myelodysplasic syndrome  or mds  clinical trials is challenging because mds spans a diverse range of abnormal blood cell production by patients 
as a result  appropriate clinical measures will vary depending upon the cross section of mds patients enrolled in a trial 
to help group similar cross sections of mds patients for clinical trial also prognostic and treatment purposes  various classification systems have been developed 
while these classification systems help in the conduct and evaluation of individual clinical trials  a lack of standardization and the evolving nature of the classification systems can make it difficult to compare the results of one trial to another trial 
therefore it is very important to understand the classification system and definitions used for a particular mds clinical trial before drawing conclusions about those results relative to other trials 
the more common classification or prognostic systems include french american british  or fab  world health organization  or who  and international prognostic scoring system  or ipss 
a key difference between fab and who classification is the percent of immature bone marrow blood cells  or blasts  required before the patient is classified as having evolved from mds to acute myeloid leukemia  or aml 
under the fab system if blasts are percent or less of all blood cells in the sample  the patient is classified as having mds 
the threshold under the who system is percent 
the factors used in the ipss to predict the potential for mds to evolve into aml and survival periods include chromosome abnormalities  proportion of bone marrow blasts  and number of abnormally low blood cell white  red or platelet types 
the ipss categories ranging from low risk to high risk of the patient s mds evolving into aml are as follows low  intermediate  intermediate  and high 
given what may be a prolonged course of mds for patients evaluated as ipss low or intermediate risk  alleviation of disease related symptoms and improved quality of life may be the most appropriate clinical measures 
for patients evaluated as ipss intermediate or high risk  extending the period of time before the disease progresses  to more severe mds or aml  or survival period may be the most appropriate clinical measures 
a group of mds clinical experts known as the international working group  or iwg  reported the results of their deliberations on standardizing response criteria for mds in the journal blood blood  
given the diverse nature of mds they identified and defined clinical measures in the following categories altering disease natural history  such as remission  disease progress and survival  cytogenetic response  meaning resolution of chromosome abnormalities  quality of life  such as improvement in physical  functioning  emotional  social and spiritual status  and hematologic improvement  meaning increased number and functioning of various types of blood cells and decrease in need for transfusions 
subsequent clinical trial results will likely adopt the standard response criteria recommended by the iwg  thereby facilitating comparisons between independent clinical trials 
marketable products aloxi injection for the prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting aloxi palonosetron hydrochloride injection is a potent  highly selective serotonin subtype  or ht  receptor antagonist differentiated by its strong receptor binding affinity and extended half life for the prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting  or cinv 
we obtained exclusive us and canada aloxi injection license and distribution rights from helsinn healthcare sa in april on july   approval was received from the fda to market aloxi injection for the prevention of acute and delayed cinv 
we began promoting aloxi injection in september through our oncology focused sales organization 
aloxi injection competes in the growing us us receptor antagonist market estimated to be billion in of this amount  the market for prevention of cinv is estimated to be approximately million 
product sales of aloxi injection in and were million and million  respectively 
chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting overview depending on the type of cancer and treatment goals determined by physicians  patients may receive chemotherapy as part of their treatment regimen 
one of the most feared side effects of most chemotherapy treatments is chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting  or cinv 
supportive care products to treat the side effects of chemotherapy  such as cinv  have emerged to improve patient comfort and compliance with treatment regimens 
while there are many types of supportive care products for cancer patients  this summary is focused on the prevention of cinv 
efforts to treat tumors such as those found in breast and lung cancer have led physicians to administer more aggressive chemotherapy regimens 
these cytotoxic agents often cause cinv by triggering release of serotonin from cells in the gastrointestinal tract 
the released serotonin stimulates nerve receptors that activate the vomiting center via the chemoreceptor trigger zone 
when  and if  serotonin stimulates serotonin subtype  or ht 
receptors to initiate nerve impulses to the central nervous system through the ht receptors  vomiting  or emesis  may ensue 
serotonin subtype  or ht receptor antagonists  such as aloxi injection  act by binding to serotonin receptors in the peripheral and possibly central nervous system  thereby blocking serotonin stimulation of the associated nerves and reducing or eliminating cinv 
cinv can be characterized as acute nausea and vomiting  occurring within hours following administration of chemotherapy  or delayed nausea and vomiting  occurring to hours following administration of chemotherapy 
although cinv has been managed to a greater degree in recent years  it is estimated that up to percent of cancer patients receiving chemotherapy will experience some degree of emesis if not prevented with an antiemetic 
the severity of emesis is dependent upon the type of chemotherapy administered  the dosing schedule of the chemotherapy  how quickly it was administered  and the patient s age and gender  among other predisposing factors 
if emesis is not properly managed  it can cause dehydration and poor quality of life  eventually leading to interruption or discontinuation of chemotherapy 
although the vast majority of patients receiving emetogenic chemotherapy are administered a ht receptor antagonist  there remains a need to improve upon the prevention of acute cinv and  especially delayed cinv 
despite the availability of preventive treatments  including first generation ht receptor antagonists  nearly fifty percent of all patients receiving chemotherapy experience nausea and vomiting 
aloxi injection clinical data for cinv the results of phase clinical trials demonstrate that aloxi injection is more effective than ondansetron zofran and dolasetron anzemet injections  which combined account for approximately percent percent of cinv sales of ht receptor antagonists in the most frequently prescribed chemotherapies  including those used to treat the most common cancers such as breast  lung and colon  are considered moderately emetogenic  or have a moderate to moderately high potential to cause nausea and vomiting 
based on the phase trials conducted  aloxi injection is shown statistically to have greater efficacy or to be as effective as ondansetron and dolasetron for prevention of acute and delayed cinv 
overall  the incidence  pattern  duration  and intensity of adverse reactions were similar among patients treated with aloxi injection and other ht receptor antagonists 
in patients treated with aloxi injection during phase trials  the most common adverse reactions related to the study drug were headache percent  and constipation percent 
the table below provides a summary of the efficacy results from these pivotal phase clinical trials  where complete response rate is defined as the proportion of treated patients which had no vomiting and no rescue medication 
moderately emetogenic chemotherapy highly emetogenic chemotherapy study study study aloxi ondansetron aloxi dolasetron aloxi ondansetron acute cinv hours delayed cinv hours overall hours indicates results that demonstrate statistically greater efficacy than the alternative ht product compared in the trial 
we believe that aloxi injection is competitive in the us cinv market for ht receptor antagonists because aloxi injection is highly selective for the ht receptor and has a thirty to seven hundred times stronger binding affinity for this receptor than other marketed ht receptor antagonists  is more potent than other marketed ht receptor antagonists  has demonstrated a plasma elimination half life of almost hours  which is four to ten times longer than any other marketed ht receptor antagonist  has demonstrated in phase trials to have statistically greater efficacy or to be as effective as ondansetron or dolasetron in preventing both acute and delayed cinv  and is the only ht receptor antagonist approved to prevent both acute and delayed nausea and vomiting caused by moderately emetogenic chemotherapy 
the potency and extended half life of aloxi injection may enable patients and their healthcare providers to control both acute and delayed cinv for several days following chemotherapy with a single intravenous dose 
we believe this single  fixed dose treatment is more convenient compared to other marketed ht 

receptor antagonists  which usually demand patients to adhere to an oral follow up therapy regimen for several days 
salagen tablets for the symptoms of xerostomia and sj gren s syndrome mgi conceived  developed and markets salagen tablets pilocarpine hydrochloride in the united states 
salagen tablets were the first prescription drug approved to treat the symptoms of chronic dry mouth in patients with radiation induced xerostomia and in patients with sj gren s syndrome 
chronic dry mouth can be a painful and debilitating condition 
salagen tablets stimulate the exocrine glands  including the salivary glands  to increase their moisture producing activity 
saliva is important to oral health and quality of life in general 
people with chronic dry mouth can experience difficulty eating and sleeping  rapid tooth decay  periodontal disease and oral infections 
sales of salagen tablets in the united states were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
salagen tablets clinically proven efficacy and safety has allowed it to maintain leadership in the market for treatment of chronic dry mouth symptoms associated with head and neck cancer patients treated with radiation and with sj gren s syndrome patients 
the fda granted us orphan drug status for salagen tablets in as a treatment for the symptoms of xerostomia induced by radiation therapy in head and neck cancer patients and in for the symptoms of dry mouth associated with sj gren s syndrome 
our orphan drug protection for salagen tablets for the treatment of symptoms of radiation induced xerostomia in head and neck cancer patients expired in march and our orphan drug protection for sj gren s syndrome expired in february in december  the fda approved a competitor s abbreviated new drug application  or anda  for a generic milligram pilocarpine hydrochloride tablet and a second anda was approved in january if the introduction of these competing products adheres to the classic pattern of initial generic competition in a pharmaceutical product class  we would expect salagen tablet sales in to decline significantly 
as a result  we suspended promotion of salagen tablets 
also  in december  we entered into a five year manufacturing supply and distribution agreement for milligram pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets  with purepac pharmaceutical co 
purepac  a subsidiary of alpharma  inc under the terms of this manufacturing  supply and distribution agreement  we will manufacture and supply milligram pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets to purepac for exclusive distribution in the united states and we will receive the supply price and a portion of gross margin of sales by purepac 
head and neck cancer although often effective in treating primary tumors of the head and neck  radiation therapy can permanently damage a patient s salivary glands  resulting in xerostomia  a significant  chronic reduction of saliva production 
patients using salagen tablets for radiation induced dry mouth typically take one tablet three times per day during the course of radiation therapy  which will last approximately six to eight weeks and may then take it indefinitely to treat the residual dry mouth symptoms that follow radiation therapy 
salagen tablets have been shown to stimulate the residual functioning tissue in the damaged salivary glands to increase saliva production and provide patients with a longer lasting solution for the symptoms of radiation induced chronic dry mouth 
in two week trials that were the primary basis for the approval of salagen tablets in  patients who had been treated with radiation therapy for head and neck cancer were assessed for the ability of salagen tablets  versus placebo  to relieve the symptoms of dry mouth and to stimulate saliva production 
in both trials  patients who received salagen tablets experienced significant improvement in their overall condition of dry mouth 
those patients also demonstrated statistically significant improvements in salivary flow compared to the patients receiving placebo tablets 
less than one percent of the patients who received salagen tablets withdrew from these trials due to lack of efficacy 
sweating was the most commonly reported side effect  however  less than one percent of patients taking the approved dosing regimen withdrew from the trial due to sweating 
sj gren s syndrome sj gren s syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disorder in which the body s own immune system attacks the moisture producing glands  including the salivary glands  causing them to lose their ability to produce adequate moisture 
symptoms of sj gren s syndrome vary in degree and type  but the common component is chronic dryness 
patients can exhibit dry mouth  swollen glands  dry eyes  vaginal dryness and fatigue 
the syndrome can be manifested alone primary sj gren s or in combination with other autoimmune disorders secondary sj gren s 
in patients with sj gren s syndrome related dry mouth  salagen tablets can help to relieve the symptoms of oral dryness 
salagen tablets can stimulate the salivary glands to increase production of saliva  which is essential to maintaining good oral health 
for sj gren s syndrome patients  previously available therapies included tear and saliva substitutes 
these types of products provide transient relief at best and often fail to prevent complications 
in two week trials that were the primary basis for the supplemental approval of salagen tablets for sj gren s syndrome in  a total of primary or secondary sj gren s syndrome patients were assessed for the ability of salagen tablets  versus placebo  to relieve the symptoms of dry mouth and to stimulate saliva production 
patients receiving salagen tablets four times a day reported a significant improvement in their symptoms associated with oral dryness  and they also demonstrated a significant increase in saliva for the full weeks 
similar to the salagen tablet trials in head and neck cancer patients  less than one percent of the patients receiving salagen tablets withdrew from the trial due to lack of efficacy 
the most common side effect was mild to moderate sweating 
less than four percent of patients taking the approved dosing regimen withdrew from the study due to sweating 
hexalen capsules for ovarian cancer in november  we purchased worldwide rights to hexalen altretamine capsules from medimmune oncology  inc hexalen capsules are an orally administered chemotherapy that is approved as a second line treatment of ovarian cancer 
hexalen capsules are approved for the treatment of ovarian cancer in countries including the united states 
sales of hexalen capsules in the united states were million in in the two trials that were the primary basis for its approval in the united states  hexalen capsules were administered as a single agent for or days of a day cycle 
in the patients with measurable or evaluable disease  there were seven complete responses and two partial responses for an overall response rate of percent 
the duration of these responses ranged from two months in a patient with a palpable pelvic mass to months in a patient who achieved a complete response 
in some patients  tumor regression was associated with improvement in symptoms and performance status 
side effects of hexalen capsules are comparable to those seen with other approved chemotherapies and include mild to moderate bone marrow suppression  nausea and vomiting  numbness  tingling or pain of hands or feet  and central nervous system symptoms 
another trial in ovarian cancer patients  which was published in gynecologic oncology vol 
pages   investigated the ability of six months of treatment with hexalen capsules to extend survival following achievement of a complete response with front line therapy 
at two years  following completion of front line therapy  patients in this trial demonstrated a higher survival rate compared to that seen in earlier trials 
kadian capsules for cancer pain in july  we entered into a three year promotion agreement for kadian capsules  a sustained release formulation of morphine  with alpharma  inc under the terms of this promotion agreement  we promote kadian capsules in the united states to oncology health care professionals for moderate to severe pain associated with cancer 
we began promoting kadian capsules to oncologists in september of kadian capsules continue to be marketed by alpharma to pain specialists in the united states  other than oncology health care professionals 
products under development dacogen injection overview in september  we obtained exclusive worldwide rights to the development  commercialization  manufacturing and distribution of dacogen decitabine injection for all indications from supergen  inc dacogen injection is an investigational anti cancer therapeutic which is currently in development for the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome  or mds 
dacogen injection regulatory applications for the treatment of mds are being reviewed for marketing approval by the fda in the united states and the emea in europe 
a pivotal phase trial and two supporting phase trials for the mds indication form the clinical basis of these applications 
the fda has established september  as the prescription drug user fee act  or pdufa  action goal date for the nda 
supergen will  with our assistance  continue to pursue these mds regulatory applications and all mds responsibilities will transition to us by the end of we have assumed responsibility for development of all other indications for dacogen injection 
the anticancer activity of dacogen injection is due to both inhibition of cell growth  or cytotoxicity  which is observed at higher doses and decreasing methylation of deoxyribonucleic acid  or dna  which is predominately observed at lower doses 
decreasing dna methylation  or hypomethylation  is a relatively new approach to cancer treatment 
excess dna methylation has been implicated as a fundamental factor in the development of cancers 
researchers have determined that an increase in specific methylation of dna can result in blocking the expression of genes  such as tumor suppressor genes 
in clinical trials  researchers have demonstrated that dacogen injection can reverse the methylation of dna  potentially leading to re expression of tumor suppressor genes 
in clinical trials  dacogen injection has demonstrated activity in mds  acute myeloid leukemia  or aml  and chronic myeloid leukemia  or cml 
preclinical data suggest that dacogen injection may be effective in the treatment of solid tumor cancers where dna methylation status is believed to be important  such as melanoma  colon and ovarian cancer 
myelodysplastic syndrome mds is a bone marrow disorder characterized by bone marrow production of abnormally functioning  immature blood cells 
according to the american cancer society and the aplastic anemia and mds international foundation  approximately  to  new cases of mds are diagnosed each year in the united states  although it is difficult to accurately determine the incidence because mds is not recorded by the national tumor registry in the united states 
in the majority of afflicted patients  mds results in death from bleeding and infection 
in approximately percent of patients  mds will convert to acute myeloid leukemia or aml  a disease with a high mortality rate 
in multiple phase trials in europe  dacogen injection demonstrated activity for treating patients with mds 
based on positive results from these european phase trials  a randomized phase study was conducted at over cancer centers in north america that compared dacogen injection plus best supportive care treatment to supportive care treatment alone in a total of mds patients 
best supportive care involved treatment with antibiotics  blood growth factors and blood transfusions 
dacogen injection was administered intravenously over three hours at a dose of milligrams for each square meter of body surface area  every eight hours for three consecutive days 
the co primary endpoints of the trial were overall response rate  or the sum of the percent of patients experiencing complete and partial responses  as defined by the international working group  or iwg  criteria and time to aml diagnosis or death 
secondary endpoints included duration of response  cytogenetic response rate  transfusion requirements  quality of life  survival  and safety 
an independent review of bone marrow and response data was conducted 
in december at the american society of hematology  or ash  annual meeting  data from the phase trial were presented 
the overall response rate complete responses plus partial responses as defined by intent to treat criteria  or itt  for patients treated with dacogen injection following independent and blinded review  was percent with a median response duration of days  compared to zero percent in the patients receiving only supportive care treatment 
this overall response rate is statistically significant 
median time to aml diagnosis or death was days for the dacogen injection treatment arm compared to days for patients who received only supportive care 
all patients who responded to dacogen injection treatment became or remained transfusion independent and had higher quality of life scores for several parameters  including improvement of global health status  physical functioning  fatigue  and shortness of breath 
the primary toxicity associated with dacogen injection treatment was suppression of bone marrow production of blood cells  or myelosuppression  including suppressed production of white blood cells  or neutropenia  blood clotting cells  or thrombocytopenia  and red blood cells  or anemia 
the results from this phase trial are consistent with those from the phase trials and confirm activity of dacogen injection for mds 
also presented at the december ash annual meeting were interim results of a trial designed to compare three different dosing regimens for dacogen injection 
mds patients in this trial were randomized to receive one of three dacogen injection regimens every four to six weeks 
of the patients who had data available for evaluation at the time of the interim analysis  the overall response rate was percent  including a percent complete response rate and an percent partial response rate 
adverse events were primarily a result of myelosuppression and included fever percent and infection percent 
these data support the hypothesis that these alternative dacogen injection regimens are active in treating mds patients and may offer dose scheduling flexibility 
the phase trial was designed to support regulatory approval of dacogen injection for the treatment of patients with mds 
dacogen injection received orphan drug designation for mds in the united states and europe  which may provide us with seven years of marketing exclusivity in the united states and ten years marketing exclusivity in europe  if dacogen injection is approved for treatment of mds by the respective regulatory authorities 
however  the regulatory approval processes may take a significant amount of time and dacogen injection may not be approved 
in may  azacitidine was approved by the fda as the first drug to be approved for the treatment of mds 
if dacogen injection is also approved for treatment of mds  it will compete directly with azacitidine 
sales of azacitidine began on july  and totaled million during other potential indications beyond the activity of dacogen injection for mds  we believe phase and trials demonstrate that dacogen injection may be active in a variety of other hematological malignancies such as aml and cml 
we expect to begin a phase trial of dacogen injection in aml patients in the first half of and we are currently conducting a multi center phase trial with dacogen injection for the treatment of refractory cml in patients who have failed previous front line therapy 
phase results also suggest that dacogen injection may be useful for treatment of non malignant diseases such as sickle cell anemia  for which we are supplying dacogen injection to investigators for their phase clinical trials in this area of study 
dacogen received orphan drug designation from the fda for sickle cell anemia in september  which may provide seven years of marketing exclusivity in the united states if dacogen injection is approved by the fda for the treatment of sickle cell anemia 
further  the dacogen injection clinical and scientific program is the subject of a clinical research and development agreement  or crada  with the national cancer institute  or nci 
pursuant to the crada  we will supply dacogen injection for pre clinical and clinical trials that will be managed by the nci and that will focus primarily on the treatment of solid tumors 
saforis oral suspension overview saforis oral suspension is a late stage  novel  proprietary oral formulation of l glutamine  an amino acid which is critical to the repair of cellular damage 
in multiple clinical trials  saforis oral suspension decreased the duration and or severity of chemotherapy induced inflammation of the tissues lining the mouth  or oral mucositis 
additionally  saforis oral suspension reduced the healing time of oral mucositis  reduced patients requirements for analgesics to treat pain due to oral mucositis  improved patients ability to swallow  thereby improving nutrition and improved patients overall quality of life 
in  a phase trial of saforis oral suspension was completed in randomized patients and it met its primary clinical objective of clinically significant reduction of oral mucositis in patients receiving saforis oral suspension compared to those patients receiving the placebo 
a second phase trial is planned to begin in our goal is for saforis oral suspension to be the first product marketed in the united states for the prevention and treatment of chemotherapy induced oral mucositis 
saforis received fast track designation from the food and drug administration in  which is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of applications of drugs that are intended to treat serious or life threatening conditions and demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need for such a condition 
oral mucositis oral mucositis is one of the most common dose limiting toxicities of cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy 
the incidence of oral mucositis in patients receiving chemotherapy ranges from percent in those patients receiving standard chemotherapy doses to percent in patients receiving high chemotherapy doses related to bone marrow transplantation  or bmt 
in addition  virtually all patients experience oral mucositis following radiotherapy of the head and neck region 
oral mucositis usually occurs within to days after the administration of chemotherapy or radiotherapy  and can last for to weeks  or longer in patients with below normal numbers of white blood cells 
as mucositis becomes more severe  breaks in the tissue surface  or ulcers  develop 
these ulcers may be extremely painful  may temporarily interfere with oral intake and nutrition  may reduce the patient s quality of life  and may result in serious clinical complications  including systemic infection 
severe oral mucositis with extensive ulceration may require hospitalization and direct into the bloodstream  or intravenous  administration of narcotics for pain management and supplements for nutrition 
further  oral mucositis frequently leads to dose reductions in subsequent chemotherapy cycles  and the pain of mucositis may discourage patients from continuing cancer treatment 
l glutamine l glutamine has multiple functions in the human body  including enabling the transfer of nitrogen between tissues and regulation of protein synthesis 
l glutamine is a conditionally essential amino acid  because it is critical in times of serious illness when tissue repair is necessary or during times of high levels of cell replication 
when such increased demands occur  the requirements for l glutamine can exceed the body s ability to produce sufficient amounts and intake of l glutamine is needed to maintain normal plasma concentrations 
the rapidly dividing cells of tissues lining the mouth cavity  or oral mucosa  use l glutamine not only as the primary fuel for cell replication  but also as the nitrogen source for cellular repair 
thus  the availability of l glutamine becomes critical when these tissues have been injured as a result of chemotherapy or radiotherapy 
when l glutamine is taken orally  it does not readily dissolve and it is quickly converted into an ineffective molecule 
both topical delivery to the oral mucosa or swallowing of l glutamine has previously been limited by these factors and by widespread metabolism throughout the body 
even when administered intravenously  this widespread metabolism may limit the l glutamine available within the oral mucosa 
saforis oral suspension  with its proprietary delivery system  delivers times more l glutamine into mucosal epithelial cells compared to l glutamine without this proprietary delivery system 
the availability of adequate l glutamine should allow damaged cells to regain normal function after injury  regulate and support protein synthesis  and provide critical metabolic energy and nitrogen that can optimize growth rates of replicating cells in rebuilding tissues 
zyca overview the goal of treatment with zyca is to enhance the natural immune response of a patient infected with human papilloma virus  or hpv  by allowing the immune process to produce a substance that is seen as foreign  an hpv antigen  which results in a heightened immune system response to hpv in the patient 
the enhanced immune response  in the form of activated cells is expected to recognize and heal the patient s abnormal growth of cervical tissue  or cervical dysplasia 
zyca is a circular form of double strand dna that can exist outside the nucleus of a cell  or plasmid dna  contained within biodegradable poly lactide co glycolide  or plg  microparticles 
this microencapsulation based formulation of zyca facilitates uptake of plasmid dna by certain antigen presenting cells  or apcs 
once internalized by an apc  the plasmid dna is used to produce a protein  fragments of which attach to carrier molecules 
this complex migrates to the surface of the apc and is recognized by t cells specific for hpv 
these t cells  representing an enhanced immune response  migrate to the cervix and eliminate the hpv positive disease causing cells  thereby enabling the patient to heal 
we are currently developing zyca as a treatment for young women with high grade cervical dysplasia 
a phase  multicenter  randomized placebo controlled trial of women with high grade cervical dysplasia was conducted in the united states and europe 
patients enrolled in this phase trial received an intramuscular injection of zyca every three weeks for a total of three doses 
zyca was shown to be safe and well tolerated 
in a prospectively defined cohort of patients under years of age  the drug promoted resolution of high grade dysplasia in percent of patients  versus percent in the placebo arm 
in all patients  resolution was percent for patients on drug and percent for patients on placebo 
in other open label trials  the drug was found to be safe and well tolerated and disease resolution was observed in a high percentage of young patients 
the most frequently observed adverse event in these trials was mild to moderate injection site pain  which was manageable with ibuprofen or acetaminophen 
a phase trial to further assess the safety and efficacy of zyca will begin in and is being designed to become a key part of a submission for seeking marketing approval 
human papilloma virus and cervical dysplasia overview human papilloma virus  or hpv  refers to a group of viruses that includes more than different strains or types 
more than of these viruses are sexually transmitted and can infect the genital area 
the areas include the skin of the penis  vulva  or anus  and the lining of the vagina  cervix  and rectum 
most people who become infected with hpv will not have any symptoms  and the infection will resolve on its own 
in the united states  approximately million people are currently infected with hpv 
at least percent of sexually active men and women acquire genital hpv infection at some point in their lives 
it is estimated that as many as percent of women have had hpv or are currently infected by hpv and that by age  at least percent will have acquired genital hpv infection 
hpv is the cause of cervical dysplasia 
the three types of cervical dysplasia also called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia  or cin are mild  or cin  moderate  or cin  and severe  or cin mild dysplasia is by far the most common type 
mild dysplasia is not considered to be a true pre cancerous disease by many experts  because in about percent of cases the abnormal cervical tissue reverts to normal tissue over time without any specific medical intervention 
however  in a subset of women  mild dysplasia can progress to a more serious disease 
often  moderate and severe types of cervical dysplasia  or cin  are grouped together and called high grade cervical dysplasia 
a diagnosis of cin is based upon cellular changes  or transformation  that leads to sufficiently abnormal cervical cell replication and the generation of a cervical lesion that is deemed a pre cancerous condition 
this diagnosis requires that women be treated to eliminate the lesion and the causative transformed cells  which have the potential to develop into cervical cancer over a long period of time 
cin lesions are generally treated by a surgical excision procedure called the loop electrocautery excisional procedure  or leep 
this surgical and other cin treatments are associated with efficacy rates of percent to percent 
however  these procedures are invasive and can cause a number of short term and long term side effects 
leep places women at risk because it is a surgical procedure and can result in complications such as bleeding  a narrowing of the cervical opening  cervical incompetence  loss of mucous glands  and secondary infertility 
zyc our second immunotherapy compound in clinical development is zyc zyc  an encapsulated plasmid encoding a commonly expressed tumor antigen  has completed a phase a trial in patients with late stage metastatic hematological and solid tumors 
the enzyme cytochrome p b  or cypb  is encoded by the zyc plasmid 
data from this trial were selected for oral presentation at the american society of clinical oncology  or asco  annual meeting and demonstrated that zyc was well tolerated and biologically active 
during  we intend to advance zyc into a clinical trial in patients with solid tumors 
the immune system and zyc recent studies  in both human and animal systems  have provided compelling evidence that the immune system can be activated to specifically recognize human tumor cells and kill them 
most attention has focused on thymus derived cells  or t cells  as the principal cause of anti tumor immunity especially in light of findings that tumor derived proteins function as tumor associated antigens  or taa  and targets for t cells 
the demonstration that taa specific immune responses can lead to tumor regression has been borne out extensively in animal models and data from clinical trials suggest that this approach is safe  feasible  and potentially effective in humans 
until recently  clinical efforts have been somewhat limited  in part because most tumor antigens are restricted in expression to one or a few tumor types and to a fraction of subjects with these types of tumors 
cypb  the enzyme encoded in the zyc plasmid  is widely expressed in human cancer but rarely in normal tissues 
administration of zyc in preclinical studies resulted in anti tumor t cell responses and results from preclinical toxicity studies warranted clinical development 
a phase a clinical trial in subjects with advanced malignancies who had failed prior cancer treatments was conducted to test the safety  bioactivity and clinical activity of zyc each patient was administered zyc intramuscularly every other week for the target number of at least but not more than doses at a fixed dose level 
from a safety perspective  zyc was well tolerated 
with the exception of a single subject who experienced abscesses at the injection site  no systemic or local toxicity was considered related to treatment with zyc  and only mild to moderate localized injection site reactions were observed 
from a bioactivity perspective  despite their advanced cancer stage and history of prior chemotherapy treatment  most patients were determined to have an immune response to zyc increased levels of cypb  or biologic responses  were observed in percent of patients who received more than doses and in percent of the patients receiving doses of zyc from a clinical activity perspective  patients had stable disease following their last dose of zyc and all other patients had progressive disease 
each of the patients who had disease stabilization was an immune responder 
clinical response to subsequent chemotherapy was remarkable with all patients who earlier had demonstrated a biologic response to zyc showing clinical benefit and exhibited durable clinical responses  including complete response that lasted more than twelve months 
none of the non biologic responders benefited from subsequent chemotherapy 
in summary  the data support proceeding with additional clinical development of zyc aloxi injection for the prevention of post operative nausea and vomiting ponv aloxi palonosetron hydrochloride injection is a potent  highly selective serotonin subtype  or ht  receptor antagonist differentiated by its strong receptor binding affinity and extended half life and has already been approved for the prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting 
we are working with helsinn healthcare  the licensor of palonosetron hydrochloride  to design phase programs with a goal to seek fda approval of aloxi injection for the prevention of post operative nausea and vomiting  or ponv 
a special protocol assessment process  or spa  is being discussed with the fda and phase trials are expected to begin during post operative nausea and vomiting  or ponv  is a common consequence of anesthetic and surgical procedures 
patients undergoing abdominal  gynecological  ear  nose and throat  cardiovascular  and eye surgery are at the highest risk for ponv 
if not prevented  ponv can delay discharge from the medical facility  cause hospital re admissions and increase healthcare costs for patients who undergo surgery 
approximately million doses of ht 

receptor antagonists are used annually for prevention of ponv in the united states  with sales of approximately million 
irofulven for chemotherapy treatment of cancer irofulven is our lead cancer therapy product candidate under development and is part of our family of proprietary cancer therapy compounds called acylfulvenes 
acylfulvenes  including irofulven  are semi synthetic derivatives of the natural product illudin s obtained from the omphalotus olearius mushroom 
we licensed rights to the entire class of acylfulvene agents  including irofulven  from the regents of the university of california in irofulven is potentially active as an anti cancer agent in treating a broad range of cancers  has a unique mechanism of action that may make it effective in treating refractory cancers  or cancers that are unresponsive to existing cancer therapies and useful in combination with existing cancer therapies  has demonstrated activity against tumors that are known to be resistant to other cancer therapies  and has a side effect profile that is adequately tolerated 
mechanism of action studies have indicated that irofulven is rapidly taken up by sensitive tumor cell types where it reacts with tumor cell dna and protein targets in a novel manner  producing rapid inhibition of dna synthesis and dna lesions that are difficult for the tumor cell to repair 
the initiation of dna damage by irofulven begins a tumor selective cascade of cellular events that ultimately causes cell death  or apoptosis 
clinical trials will determine whether the differential effect of irofulven on tumor cells compared to healthy cells translates into important clinical benefit 
we further believe that irofulven could be the first of a series of acylfulvene analogs that merit development as cancer therapies 
we believe irofulven has a unique mechanism of action that makes it well suited for study in refractory patient populations and in combination with other cancer therapies 
preclinical data and clinical data demonstrate irofulven s activity against tumors that are known to be resistant to other therapies 
preclinical studies have also demonstrated the additive or synergistic effect of irofulven with a number of marketed cancer therapies 
to date  irofulven has demonstrated a side effect profile relative to certain marketed cancer therapies  which we believe enhances the prospect of irofulven combining well with these cancer therapies 
therefore  we believe that pursuing development paths in refractory cancers and in combination with other cancer therapies is warranted 
preclinical toxicology studies in rats and dogs and initial clinical data from the dosing of over  cancer patients with irofulven have demonstrated that irofulven is adequately tolerated as a chemotherapeutic compound and its side effects are reversible 
the primary dose limiting side effect has been bone marrow suppression  usually observed as decreased blood platelet or white cell counts 
other drug related side effects have been nausea  vomiting  visual disturbances and fatigue 
bone marrow suppression has been controlled through dose adjustments or treatment delays to allow recovery of platelet or white cell counts 
nausea and vomiting are prophylactically controlled with standard  currently available treatments 
visual disturbances and fatigue are managed by dose adjustments and are reversible after discontinuation of treatment 
to obtain marketing approval for irofulven in the united states  pivotal registration trials would need to be successfully completed and submitted to the fda 
phase trials typically use survival as the primary endpoint  compared to a randomly determined control group and have a higher number of enrolled patients than in earlier phases 
irofulven single agent trials we conducted single agent phase dose ranging trials using daily and intermittent weekly administration of irofulven to determine recommended dose amounts for subsequent trials 
late stage cancer patients who were refractory to other chemotherapies enrolled in these trials and clinical activity was demonstrated in addition to determining dose amount and schedule for subsequent trials 
based on these results we tested irofulven in a variety of phase solid tumor trials 
we chose to investigate prostate  liver  ovary and pancreas because these cancer types have significant mortality and morbidity associated with them  current therapies are inadequate  there was noticeable anti cancer response in our preclinical studies or clinical trials  clinical trials for pancreas and liver cancers tend to be of a relatively short duration  and product candidates for these indications may qualify for expedited regulatory review 
anti cancer activity of irofulven has been observed in each of these trials  including objective tumor shrinkage 
irofulven combination trials we believe that an advantage of combination therapy is the potential to achieve enhanced anti cancer benefit with an acceptable side effect profile compared to either agent used alone 
because irofulven has a unique mechanism of action  retains activity against tumors that are known to be resistant to other cancer therapies and in preclinical trials demonstrated additive or synergistic effects in combination with a number of marketed chemotherapies  we are conducting drug combination trials with irofulven 
the first clinical step in exploring combination therapy is to conduct phase  dose ranging trials to determine the maximum tolerated dose of both drugs together 
we have completed phase trials of irofulven in combination with each of irinotecan  cisplatin  and capecitabine 
phase trials of irofulven are ongoing in combination with gemcitabine  docetaxel and oxaliplatin 
phase trials of irofulven in combination with other chemotherapies are described in the following summary by type of cancer 
summaries by type of cancer hormone refractory prostate cancer throughout phase and monotherapy and combination therapy trials  consistent evidence of clinical activity in hormone refractory prostate cancer  or hrpc  has been reported  including activity in patients previously treated with other chemotherapies 
phase data presented at the american society of clinical oncology asco annual meeting in indicated that irofulven in combination with prednisone  a steroid  induced decreases of more than percent in prostate specific antigen psa levels in percent of evaluable patients and disease stabilization in percent of patients evaluable for objective tumor response 
psa is a blood marker used by clinicians for treatment decisions 
activity has also been shown in prostate cancer patients treated with irofulven plus the marketed chemotherapies capecitabine or cisplatin in phase trials 
following comprehensive analysis of our available data  we initiated a phase  multi arm  randomized combination trial of irofulven in combination with capecitabine either with or without prednisone in hrpc patients previously treated with docetaxel 
most hrpc patients in the united states who are receiving chemotherapy are treated with docetaxel  and we believe significant unmet need exists among prostate cancer patients who have failed hormone therapy and who have progressed on docetaxel 
liver cancer in phase trials we evaluated irofulven in patients with liver cancer using alternative dosing schedules 
objective partial responses and sustained disease stabilization were demonstrated in these trials 
we are continuing a phase trial of irofulven in combination with irinotecan in patients with liver cancer 
in a phase trial of irofulven administered in combination with capecitabine to patients with a variety of different solid tumors  objective partial responses and sustained disease stabilization were demonstrated in patients with advanced thyroid cancer 
based on this activity  a phase trial has been initiated to evaluate the safety and efficacy of irofulven in combination with capecitabine in patients with advanced thyroid cancer 
ovarian cancer phase trials have been conducted by us and the national cancer institute  or nci  to evaluate alternative dosing schedules 
objective responses were demonstrated in these trials 
an nci trial is ongoing with irofulven in advanced ovarian cancer patients 
pancreatic cancer our initial pivotal registration trial of irofulven was for the treatment of refractory pancreatic cancer 
in february  we began a pivotal phase trial of irofulven for treating refractory pancreatic cancer patients 
initiation of this trial was based on phase results in pancreatic cancer patients  improved acute tolerance with every other week dosing of irofulven seen in the dose optimization trial  and discussions with the fda and our panel of outside oncology experts 
this phase trial was a randomized  multi center  international trial in advanced stage pancreatic cancer patients whose disease progressed after treatment with gemcitabine  the current standard of care treatment 
the primary endpoint was overall survival times following treatment with irofulven compared to continuous infusion fluorouracil  or fu 
two patients were randomized into the irofulven treatment arm for every patient enrolled in the fu control arm 
in april  we stopped enrollment in this phase clinical trial of irofulven for gemcitabine refractory pancreatic cancer patients 
despite evidence of irofulven activity  preliminary analysis of the phase data by an independent data and safety monitoring board  or dsmb  indicated that the comparator agent fu demonstrated a greater than expected survival benefit  making it statistically improbable that the final trial results could achieve our planned objectives for the trial 
for this reason  we will no longer pursue this specific indication for irofulven monotherapy in gemcitabine refractory pancreatic cancer 
nci clinical trials under a clinical trials agreement  the national cancer institute  or nci  is sponsoring and overseeing  at its own expense  a clinical trials program using irofulven in its network of designated cancer centers and other institutions 
we have agreed to provide drug product for these trials and will have access to any resulting data 
we intend to utilize the results from nci sponsored trials to further characterize the safety of irofulven as well as evaluate the potential of irofulven in additional refractory solid tumor types 
the nci has sponsored trials of irofulven in a range of solid tumor cancers and leukemias and two trials are ongoing 
other acylfulvene analogs in addition to irofulven  we have obtained license rights to acylfulvene analogs 
the synthesis and the initial biological testing of over of these analogs has been performed at the university of california  san diego  or ucsd 
at ucsd  both in vitro and in vivo anti tumor activity has been demonstrated for a significant number of the acylfulvene analogs 
further testing by the nci of some of these analogs has confirmed broad spectrum anti tumor activity 
the broad spectrum anti tumor activity of the acylfulvene analogs suggests that this class of compounds has the potential to produce additional clinical development candidates 
we are currently evaluating these analogs for further preclinical development 
mg and small molecule dna methyltransferase inhibitor programs in august  as part of our strategy to expand our portfolio of marketed and development stage anti cancer products  we entered into an exclusive license  research and development agreement with methylgene inc  or methylgene  for north america rights to its proprietary anti cancer product candidate mg and methylgene s dna methyltransferase small molecule inhibitor program 
included within our license rights is a united states patent on a method for reversing the tumor causing state of a cell by administering an agent that corrects an aberrant methylation pattern in the dna of the cell 
in amendments to the license agreement  methylgene acknowledged full satisfaction of our then current payment obligations and suspended further payment obligations by us pending completion by methylgene of a planned clinical trial with mg rights to the small molecule inhibitor program have reverted back to methylgene 
if we resume mg development  our financial responsibilities related to mg under the license agreement would also resume 
sales and marketing we believe that for successful commercialization of our products  commercial development involvement must begin from the moment we identify a product candidate for possible acquisition and development 
in this manner  factors that are important throughout the entire life cycle of a product can be appropriately managed 
from initial sales forecasting  to market research  to brand strategy  to advocate development  our commercial development function prepares our product candidates for transition to our product marketing group 
our marketing group is responsible for additional market research  brand strategy and tactics  marketing programs  design and production of promotional materials and analysis of market performance 
we use a variety of marketing programs to reach our targeted audiences  including distribution of product specific brochures in face to face meetings and direct mailings  exhibits at select medical meetings and journal advertising 
we have a person in house marketing  manufacturing  commercial management and commercial support staff who support our commercial activities 
we currently promote our products in the united states directly to oncologists using our person oncology focused sales organization 
this includes sales representatives  regional sales directors  national directors and account management or reimbursement specialists  with an average tenure of pharmaceutical experience of more than years 
this sales organization actively promotes our products in both clinical and hospital settings to approximately  physicians plus affiliated health care professionals 
specifically  these promotion activities are directed to medical  hematologic  and gynecologic oncologists  plus associated nurses  pharmacists  practice managers and support staff 
as is common in the pharmaceutical industry  our domestic product sales are made to pharmaceutical wholesalers  including specialty oncology distributors  for further distribution to the ultimate consumers of our products 
in  we expanded the sales organization in preparation for the commercial launch of aloxi injection 
we use international collaborations to commercialize our products outside the united states 
we currently have agreements with novartis pharma ag formerly ciba vision ag  kissei pharmaceutical co  ltd 
and pfizer inc formerly the upjohn company to develop and commercialize salagen tablets for the european  japanese and canadian markets  respectively 
under these agreements  we receive payments based on development milestones and or product sales in the pertinent territory 
we also have distribution agreements for salagen tablets in israel  korea  singapore  taiwan  hong kong  colombia  thailand  and malaysia 
we receive payments based upon product sales to these distributors 
research and development we maintain active drug development programs for our product candidates and commercialized products 
current drug development efforts are primarily focused on dacogen injection  zyca  saforis oral suspension  irofulven and aloxi products 
licensing development milestone payments are recognized as research and development expense 
we also participate in post marketing trials to support the continued commercialization of our marketed products 
we seek product candidate acquisitions in order to expand our development pipeline 
as of february  we employed persons in research and development  regulatory affairs and product formulation 
we have incurred significant research and development costs in the past and believe that substantial capital resources will be required to support current and future development programs 
we spent approximately million in  million in  and million in on research and development 
in recent years  to percent of our research and development expense was attributable to license payments 
approximately percent of our research and development expense in was attributable to third party services  license fees or fda user fees 
funding for research and development is expected to come from internally generated funds  joint ventures  strategic alliances or other sources of capital  including equity or debt offerings 
successful drug development requires a broad spectrum of scientific  clinical and product development expertise 
as part of our strategy  we generally do not directly conduct basic research or traditional drug discovery activities because we primarily intend to acquire rights to product candidates that are in the human clinical stage of development 
this approach substantially reduces our research risk due to product failure and minimizes our direct investment in discovery research laboratories and personnel 
we manage our human clinical development of product candidates by selectively outsourcing certain activities 
we have in house clinical  product development  data management  biostatistics  medical writing and regulatory capabilities  which allows us to direct product formulation  manage clinical trials  monitor adverse drug experience reporting  and file new drug applications with regulatory bodies 
we outsource other development activities  such as laboratory projects  conduct of preclinical studies  production of clinical supplies and certain aspects of clinical trial conduct 
we expect to continue to contract with third parties until it is necessary and economical to add these capabilities internally 
international alliances kissei pharmaceutical co  ltd 
in december  we entered into a license agreement with kissei under which we granted to kissei an exclusive  royalty bearing license to develop and commercialize salagen tablets in japan 
kissei granted back to us an irrevocable  non exclusive  royalty free license allowing us to use any technology or data developed by kissei relating to salagen tablets

in addition  we make development milestone payments prior to commercialization of the product 
we have also agreed to pay royalties on net sales revenues  subject to annual minimum requirements 
through december   we have made approximately  in cash payments to the university under this agreement 
unless earlier terminated by the parties  the term of the agreement extends until the later of a the expiration of the last to expire patent we have licensed  or b ten years from the date of the first commercial sale of products developed from the acylfulvene analogs 
mg and other dna methyltransferase inhibitors in august  we entered into a license  research and development agreement with methylgene inc  or methylgene  for two anti cancer product programs 
under the agreement  methylgene granted to us an exclusive  royalty bearing license to develop and commercialize mg in north america for all therapeutic indications 
the agreement also included similar rights to small molecule dna methyltransferase inhibitors for oncology and rheumatology indications 
in exchange for the licenses  we agreed to make initial cash payments to methylgene  make certain development milestone payments for both mg and the first dna methyltransferase inhibitor that achieves such development milestones  purchase research services from methylgene  and pay methylgene royalties on annual future net sales revenue 
through the time of the initial regulatory approvals in the united states and canada  the initial and milestone cash payments would aggregate to approximately million for each of the two development programs 
unless earlier terminated by the parties  the term of the agreement extends until the later of a the expiration of the last to expire patent we have licensed  or b ten years from the date of the first commercial sale of any licensed product 
simultaneous with the execution of the license agreement  we entered into a stock purchase agreement and have purchased the million of methylgene common stock required by this agreement 
in subsequent amendments to the license agreement  methylgene acknowledged full satisfaction of our then current payment obligations and suspended further payment obligations by us pending completion by methylgene of a planned clinical trial with mg rights to the small molecule inhibitor program have reverted back to methylgene 
if we resume development of mg  our financial responsibilities related to mg under the license agreement would also resume

patents and proprietary rights we rely on patent rights  orphan drug designation  trade secrets  trademarks  and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products in both the united states and selected foreign jurisdictions 
current patent and orphan drug status with respect to certain of our owned and in licensed products is as follows subject status issue date country palonosetron and process for preparation four us patents issued  various patent applications pending april   april   november   and october  united states and various other countries irofulven and use of irofulven  as cancer therapy agent three us patents issued  twenty european patents issued  patents issued in australia  new zealand  china and korea  various patent applications pending august   june   and october  us united states and various other countries synthetic methods for preparing acylfulvenes and compounds useful as intermediates for preparing acylfulvenes six us patents issued  various patent applications pending march   january   december   october   october   and april  us united states and various other countries substituted acylfulvene compounds and use as cancer therapy agents not including irofulven eight us patents issued  various patent applications pending august   august   february   may   november   april   april  and april  united states and various other countries irofulven for treatment of pancreatic cancer orphan drug designated on april  united states irofulven for treatment of ovarian cancer orphan drug designated on july  united states irofulven for treatment of renal cell carcinoma orphan drug designated on july  united states mg antisense compound for treatment of cancer seven us patents issued  various patent applications pending november   july   july   february   april   may   and february  united states and various other countries subject status issue date country oral glutamine to reduce stomatitis two us patents issued  one patent application pending august   and august  united states use of carbohydrate solutions to facilitate drug delivery one us patent issued  one patent application pending may  united states microparticles for delivery of nucleic acid one us and one australian patent issued  various patent applications pending january  us  and july  australia united states and various other countries immunogenic peptides from the hpv e protein three us and one australian patent issued  various patent applications pending january   february   and june  us  and august  australia united states and various other countries microencapsulated dna for vaccination and gene therapy i one us  one australian  and ten european patents issued  various patent applications pending december  us  may  austria  june  australia  may  belgium  switzerland  germany  denmark  france  uk  italy  netherlands  and sweden united states and various other countries microencapsulated dna for vaccination and gene therapy ii two us and one australian patent issued  various applications pending august   and june  us  november  australia united states and various other countries improvements relating to encapsulation of bioactive agents three us  one australian  and four european patents issued  various patent applications pending october   june   and may  us  october  australia  september  germany  france  u

the term of a us patent issuing from an application filed on or after june  is years from its effective filing date 
the drug price and competition and patent term restoration act of  the generic animal drug act  and the patent term restoration act generally provide that a patent relating to  among other items  a human drug product  may be extended for a period of up to five years by the us commissioner of patents and trademarks if the patented item was subject to regulatory review by the fda before the item was marketed 
under these acts  a product s regulatory review period which consists generally of the period from the time when the exemption to permit clinical investigations becomes effective until the fda grants marketing approval for the product forms the basis for determining the length of the extension an applicant may receive 
in addition  a patent term can be extended for an additional six months in the us if the applicant performs additional testing in the pediatric population  as requested by the fda 
there can be no assurance that any issued patents will be extended in term 
in addition  no grant of patent term extension will prevent a challenge to the underlying patent s validity or a judicial finding that the underlying patent infringes on the rights of any third party 
we have licensed or obtained patent protection for palonosetron hydrochloride  irofulven and the other acylfulvene analogs  decitabine  certain formulations of l glutamine  zyca and zyc patent positions of pharmaceutical companies are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual issues 
therefore  although we believe our patents are valid  we cannot predict with any precision the scope or enforceability of the claims 
in addition  there can be no assurance that our patent applications will result in issued patents  that issued patents will provide an adequate measure of protection against competitive technology which could circumvent such patents  or that issued patents would withstand review and be held valid by a court of competent jurisdiction 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that infringement of any issued patents cannot be circumvented by others 
orphan drugs are currently provided seven years of marketing exclusivity for an approved indication following approval to market by the fda  and are provided ten years of marketing exclusivity for an approved indication following approval to market by the emea 
orphan drug designation for our products does not  however  insulate us from other manufacturers attempting to develop an alternate drug for the designated indication  or the designated drug for another  separate indication 
we also rely on trade secrets and continuing innovation that we seek to protect with reasonable business procedures for maintaining trade secrets  including confidentiality agreements with our collaborators  employees and consultants 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets and proprietary know how will not otherwise be known or be independently discovered by competitors 
in addition to the patents which form the basis of the pharmaceutical focus of this company  we also own four us patents which claim maize plants that are resistant to certain herbicides and that also claim methods for producing such resistant plants 
these patents were issued between and while these patents have been licensed to basf originally licensed to american cyanamid  we may still incur expenses associated with any litigation  interference or other administrative proceedings related to these patents 
trademarks we have obtained registration of the salagen trademark in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions 
in addition  we have been assigned the hexalen and saforis trademarks in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions  we use the dacogen trademark under a license with supergen  we use the federally registered didronel trademark under a license with procter gamble and we use the aloxi trademark under a license with helsinn healthcare sa 
competition the pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive  based mostly on product performance and pricing 
many members of the industry have resources far greater than we do  providing them with potentially greater flexibility in developing and marketing their products 
while we will seek to protect our products from direct competition through filing patents  seeking marketing exclusivity under the orphan drug act  and maintaining technical information as trade secrets  there is no way to protect us from competition from products with different chemical composition or products made using different technology 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our plan to gain product specific protection for each of our pharmaceuticals or that developments by others will not render our products noncompetitive or obsolete 
competition in the markets for salagen pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets is expected to intensify during because beginning in december generic milligram pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets entered the united states markets where salagen tablets pilocarpine hydrochloride compete 
if the introduction of these competing products adheres to the classic pattern of initial generic competition in a pharmaceutical product class  we would expect salagen tablets sales to decline significantly from our sales of million in the united states 
as a result  we suspended direct promotion of salagen tablets 
further  cevimeline hydrochloride is owned by snow brand pharmaceuticals  inc and marketed by daiichi pharmaceuticals in the united states  as a treatment for dry mouth symptoms associated with sj gren s syndrome 
we cannot estimate what ultimate effect this competing compound will have on the overall size of the sj gren s syndrome market and future demand for salagen tablets 
a product marketed by medimmune  inc  amifostine  was approved in june by the fda for reducing the incidence of radiation induced dry mouth in post operative head and neck cancer patients 
salagen tablets are approved in part for the treatment of dry mouth symptoms resulting from radiation used to treat head and neck cancer patients 
due to the more restricted patient population for amifostine  as well as other factors such as price and invasive administration  we currently believe that amifostine will not have a significant impact on sales of salagen tablets 
we believe other products are currently under development that may compete with salagen tablets 
hexalen capsules are approved in the united states for the treatment of ovarian cancer in patients with persistent or recurrent disease following first line therapy with certain other chemotherapies 
other chemotherapies are also used for second line treatment of ovarian cancer and are marketed by pharmaceutical companies with greater resources than we have 
further  competitors could develop and introduce generic drugs that are comparable to hexalen capsules 
aloxi palonosetron hydrochloride injection was the fourth ht antagonist approved for marketing in the united states 
the companies that market the other ht receptor antagonists have far greater resources than we have 
further  there is no certainty that the patent protection afforded palonosetron hydrochloride will be effective in keeping generic equivalents from entering the market 
many companies of all sizes  including large pharmaceutical companies as well as specialized biotechnology companies  are developing cancer therapy drugs that will compete with our product candidates under development  if any of them are approved for sale 
there are also a number of products already on the market that will compete directly with our product candidates if any of them are approved 
in addition  colleges  universities  governmental agencies and other public and private research institutions will continue to conduct research and may develop new therapies or treatments which would render our drug candidates obsolete or non competitive 
many of our competitors also have substantially greater financial  research and development  human and other resources than we do 
government regulation our research and marketing activities are subject to significant regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
pharmaceutical products intended for therapeutic use in humans are governed by fda regulations in the united states and by comparable regulations in foreign countries 
the process of completing clinical testing and obtaining fda approval for a new drug product requires a number of years and the expenditure of substantial resources without any assurance that approval for marketing will be granted 
the fda has established mandatory procedures to regulate the manufacturing and testing process regarding the identity  strength  quality and purity of a product 
following initial formulation  the steps required before any new prescription pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the united states include preclinical laboratory and animal tests  submission to the fda of an investigational new drug application  or ind  adequate and well controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug  submission of a new drug application  or nda and fda review and approval of the nda prior to any commercial sale 
preclinical studies are conducted in the laboratory and in animal model systems to gain information on the drug s efficacy  mode of action  and to identify any significant safety problems 
the results of these studies are submitted to the fda as part of the ind 
testing in humans may commence days after the ind has been filed unless the fda issues a clinical hold 
additional animal studies may be performed throughout the development process 
a three phase clinical program is usually required for fda approval of a pharmaceutical product  unless accelerated approval is granted 
phase clinical trials are conducted to determine the safety profile  including the safe dosage range  metabolism and pharmacologic action of the product  and  if possible  to gain early evidence on efficacy 
although most phase trials are conducted with healthy volunteers  phase cancer trials are conducted with cancer patients 
following establishment of a safe dose from phase trials  a phase clinical program is conducted for dose ranging and to assess the safety and efficacy of the product in patients with the disease being studied 
phase confirmatory clinical trials are conducted on patients more representative of the intended patient population in terms of medical treatment  age groups  gender and ethnicity 
data from the larger phase program is to provide adequate statistical evidence of safety and efficacy necessary to evaluate the overall benefit and risk relationship in the target patient population 
phase and phase trials are usually multi center trials in order to achieve greater statistical validity and to have data from a broader patient population that is more representative of the intended patient group 
phase  or post approval trials  may be required under accelerated approval or to provide additional data on safety or efficacy of the product 
upon completion of clinical testing  and with data successfully demonstrating that the product is safe and effective for a specific indication  an nda or biologics license application or bla for biologics products may be filed with the fda 
the nda or bla contains all the scientific evidence including product formulation  manufacturing  control information  preclinical and clinical data 
fda approval of the nda or bla is required before the applicant may market the new product 
even after initial fda approval has been obtained  further trials may be required to provide additional data on safety or efficacy for current indications  or to obtain approval for uses other than those for which the product was initially approved 
moreover  such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which a drug may be marketed 
even if fda approval is obtained  there can be no assurance of commercial success for any product 
post marketing testing may be required  and surveillance programs such as reporting adverse events are required 
the fda may require withdrawal of an approved product from the market if any significant safety issues arise while a product is being marketed 
in addition  before  during and after the process of approval  our prescription drug products must all be manufactured in accordance with current good manufacturing practices as set forth by the fda 
marketing of products is also regulated by the fda 
the orphan drug provisions of the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act provide incentives to drug and biologics manufacturers to develop and manufacture drugs for the treatment of rare diseases or conditions  currently defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than  individuals in the us or  for a disease or condition that affects more than  individuals in the us  where the sponsor does not realistically anticipate that revenue generated from sales of the product will exceed the cost of its development 
under these provisions  a manufacturer of a designated orphan product can seek tax benefits  and the holder of the first fda approval of a designated orphan product will be granted a seven year period of marketing exclusivity for that product for the orphan indication 
while the marketing exclusivity of an orphan drug would deter other sponsors from obtaining approval of the same compound for the same indication  it would not prevent other types of drugs from being approved for the same indication 
the health care industry is changing rapidly as the public  government  medical professionals and the pharmaceutical industry examine ways to broaden medical coverage while controlling health care costs 
potential approaches that may affect us include managed care initiatives  pharmaceutical buying groups  formulary requirements  and efforts to regulate the marketing and pricing of pharmaceutical products 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of together with rulemaking by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms require a number of changes in medicare practices  including reimbursement 
the changes made to date  are not expected to have an adverse effect on our operations or sales  but we cannot predict the impact  if any  of future reimbursement changes 
federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations do not materially effect our operations and we believe that we are currently in material compliance with such applicable laws and regulations 
employees as of february   we had employees

including its subsidiaries  mgi  we  or the company is an oncology focused biopharmaceutical company that acquires  develops and commercializes proprietary pharmaceutical products that meet cancer patient needs 
it is our goal to become a leader in oncology through application of our three core competencies of oncology product acquisition  development and commercialization  which we apply toward our portfolio of oncology products and product candidates 
we acquire intellectual property or product rights from others after they have completed the basic research to discover the compounds that will become our product candidates or marketed products 
this allows us to focus our skills on product development and commercialization rather than directly performing drug discovery 
we have facilities in bloomington  minnesota  lexington  massachusetts  and princeton  new jersey 
we promote products directly to physician specialists in the united states using our own sales force 
our products include aloxi palonosetron hydrochloride injection  salagen pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets  hexalen altretamine capsules and kadian morphine sulfate sustained release capsules 
in the third quarter of  aloxi injection was approved by the us food and drug administration fda for the prevention of acute and delayed chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting cinv and we began promoting it 
given the large market in which aloxi injection competes and its favorable clinical profile  sales of aloxi injection substantially exceeded sales of our other products 
we obtained exclusive us and canadian license and distribution rights to aloxi injection for cinv from helsinn healthcare sa helsinn in april in november  we and helsinn expanded the agreement to include rights for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting ponv application of aloxi injection and an oral aloxi formulation 
unless we meet certain minimum aloxi product sales requirements under our license agreement with helsinn  we would be required to work with helsinn to develop a remediation plan that if not successfully implemented could result in certain aloxi product rights reverting to helsinn 
our aloxi product sales of million substantially exceeded the minimum requirement for of million 
our minimum aloxi product sales requirement for all aloxi applications is estimated to peak at approximately to million  depending upon the timing of marketing approvals for aloxi injection for ponv and aloxi oral for cinv 
our sales of aloxi injection for cinv which does not include any sales of aloxi injection for ponv or aloxi oral for cinv was million  so we believe there is minimal risk that we will not achieve our future contractual sales minimums under the helsinn license agreement 
salagen tablets are approved in the united states for two indications the symptoms of dry mouth associated with radiation treatment in head and neck cancer patients and the symptoms of dry mouth associated with sj gren s syndrome  an autoimmune disease that damages the salivary glands 
beginning in december of  generic milligram pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets entered the united states markets where salagen tablets compete and we suspended direct promotion of salagen tablets 
if the introduction of these competing products adheres to the classic pattern of initial generic competition in a pharmaceutical class  we would expect salagen tablets sales to decline significantly from our sales of million in the united states

we began promoting kadian capsules to oncologists in september kadian capsules continue to be marketed by alpharma to pain specialists in the united states  other than oncology health care professionals 
in september  we completed the acquisition of zycos  inc  a privately held  development stage company that focused on the creation and development of oncology and antiviral products 
the acquisition of zycos is expected to further our goal of building a leading oncology franchise 
zycos iterative drug formulation process allows for the rapid development of immune response therapeutics and has generated two compounds that are currently in clinical development see note of the company s notes to consolidated financial statements

such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates 
in reaching such decisions  our management applies judgment based on our understanding and analysis of relevant circumstances 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the remainder of this section describes those that are deemed critical accounting policies 
our accounting policy on revenue recognition is fully described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the majority of our revenue relates to product sales 
we recognize sales revenue when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to our customers 
as is common in the pharmaceutical industry  our domestic sales are made to pharmaceutical wholesalers for further distribution to the ultimate consumers of our products 
as such  our product sales revenue may be less than or greater than the underlying demand for our products 
we will monitor the aloxi injection product trends in the distribution channel and disclose significant differences between these trends and end user demand 
we report sales revenue net of wholesaler chargebacks  allowances for product returns  cash discounts  administrative fees and other rebates 
we estimate wholesaler chargebacks  cash discounts  administrative fees and other rebates by considering the following factors current contract prices and terms with both direct and indirect customers  estimated customer and wholesaler inventory levels and current average chargeback rates by product and by indirect customer 
the majority of the expense and year end liabilities associated with these estimates are defined contractually and resolved within several months following year end and therefore it is unlikely the actual results will differ significantly from the estimates 
we update these estimates for changes in facts and circumstances as appropriate 
our process to estimate product returns is tailored to the specific facts and circumstances of each product  including its product life cycle stage 
for new products  product returns allowance is estimated based on historical information for similar or competing products in the same distribution channel 
we obtain and evaluate product return data from distributors and  based on this evaluation  estimate return rates 
for established products  product returns allowance is estimated by considering the following factors current marketing efforts  estimated distribution channel inventory levels  underlying demand  historical experience and competitor behavior 
inventory in the distribution channel and underlying demand are estimated on a monthly basis by evaluating data obtained from a company that surveys pharmaceutical inventory movement and prescription data 
we also use this data to monitor underlying demand in relation to significant external factors such as price changes from competitors and the introduction of new products by competitors 
external and internal factors could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and on product returns 
as of december  and  we had accrued liability balances of million and million  respectively  for product returns 
the increase in product return provision from to is a result of the increased sales of aloxi injection 
the accrual reduction of  relates to sales in the prior year and is a result of a decrease of our estimated product returns allowance for aloxi injection 
actual returns decreased from to the provision related to sales in prior period is a result of a decision to stop marketing didronel iv infusion 
year ended december  in thousands balance beginning of year actual returns in current year related to sales from prior years actual returns in current year related to sales from current year current provision reduction related to sales made in prior years current provision related to sales made in current year balance end of year we also recognize revenue related to licensing agreements 
licensing revenue recognition requires management to estimate effective terms of agreements and identify points at which performance is met under the contracts such that the revenue earnings process is complete 
under this policy for out licensing arrangements  revenue related to up front  time based and performance based licensing payments is recognized over the entire contract performance period 
for our major licensing contracts  this results in the deferral of revenue amounts approximately million at december  where non refundable cash payments have been received  but the revenue is not immediately recognized due to the long term nature of the respective agreements 
following our initial estimate of the effective terms of these arrangements  subsequent developments such as contract modifications or terminations could increase or decrease the period over which the deferred revenue is recognized 
research and development expense includes work performed for us by outside vendors  collaborators and research organizations 
at each reporting period  we estimate expenses incurred but not reported or billed to us by these outside vendors 
these expense estimates typically cover a period of to weeks of expense 
actual results are recorded on a timely basis and  historically  have not been materially different from our estimates 
in addition  costs related to in licensing arrangements for product candidates are expensed as research and development until fda approval for marketing 
results of operations revenues total revenues for the years ended december   and are summarized in the following table the year ended december  in thousands  except percentage change change sales aloxi injection    n a salagen tablets other total sales licensing total revenues n a not applicable sales sales revenue increased percent to million in and increased percent to million in from million in the increase in sales revenue from to reflects increased revenue from aloxi injection and salagen tablets 
we began the promotion of aloxi injection in september  following its approval by the us food and drug administration 
sales of aloxi injection in the united states provided percent of our sales revenue in  and percent in sales of salagen tablets in the united states provided percent of our sales revenue in  percent in and percent in in december  the fda approved a competitor s abbreviated new drug application anda for a generic milligram pilocarpine hydrochloride tablet and a second anda was approved in january and we have suspended direct promotion of salagen tablets 
if the introduction of these competing products adheres to the classic pattern of initial generic competition in a pharmaceutical product class  we would expect salagen tablet sales in to decline significantly 
licensing licensing revenue decreased percent to million in but increased percent to million in from million in we and dainippon pharmaceutical co 
ltd 
agreed to terminate our collaborative acylfulvene license agreement in the third quarter of since we had no future obligations to dainippon after termination  all remaining unamortized licensing revenue related to this relationship was amortized into license revenue in for  we amortized million of deferred revenue into licensing revenue related to previously received non refundable license fees from dainippon  which included million being amortized in the third quarter of licensing revenue is a combination of deferred revenue amortization from licensing arrangements and from royalties that are recognized when the related sales occur 
we recognized million  million and million of amortized deferred revenue in  and  respectively  related to all payments received under these license agreements 
we will recognize the december  unamortized balance of million from our license agreements into licensing revenue over the expected periods of benefit for the related collaborative arrangements  which is expected to continue into future licensing revenue will fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the level of recurring royalty generating activities  and changes in amortization of deferred revenue  including the initiation or termination of licensing arrangements 
annual sales for aloxi injection are expected to be approximately million and for all other revenues are expected to be approximately million 
costs and expenses costs and expenses for the years ended december   and are summarized in the following table the year ended december  in thousands  except percentage change change costs and expenses costs of sales selling  general and administrative research and development acquired in process research and development  na n a total costs and expenses n a not applicable cost of sales cost of sales as a percent of sales was percent for  percent for and percent for the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales is primarily a result of increased sales of aloxi injection  which began in september if aloxi injection sales continue to represent an increasing percentage of our sales revenue  cost of sales will increase as a percentage of sales 
cost of sales may vary depending on the product mix and production costs 
we believe that cost of sales as a percent of product sales for our currently marketed products for will be approximately million or percent of sales 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased percent to million in and increased percent to million in from million in the increase in selling  general and administrative expense is primarily a result of increased expenditures for the commercial launch of aloxi injection in september and its continued commercialization 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses for to be approximately million 
research and development research and development expense increased percent to million in and increased percent to million in from million in all three periods include expense related to milestone payments under our license agreement for aloxi product candidates million in  million in and million in in addition  research and development expenses included license and milestone payments of million under our agreement for dacogen product candidates 
exclusive of license payments  research and development expense increased percent to million in and increased percent to million in from million in the following table details the company s research and development costs incurred for major development projects in the years ended december    and in thousands aloxi product candidates license milestone other research and development total aloxi dacogen license milestone other research and development total dacogen acylfulvenes license milestone other research and development total acylfulvenes other projects total research and development we expect total research and development expenses for to be approximately million 
aloxi products and product candidates in april  we obtained from helsinn healthcare sa helsinn the exclusive oncology license and distribution rights for aloxi injection in the united states and canada 
aloxi injection is a differentiated ht receptor antagonist for the prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting  which was approved by the fda in july under the terms of the agreement  we made all million in initial license and milestone license payments 
we expanded our agreement with helsinn in november to include rights for the postoperative nausea and vomiting ponv application of aloxi injection and an oral aloxi formulation 
under the terms of the expanded agreement  we made initial and milestone payments of million in and million in and we expect to make additional payments of million over the course of the next several years upon achievement of certain development milestones that culminate with the approvals of aloxi injection for the prevention of ponv and an oral aloxi formulation 
phase trials are expected to begin during with a goal to seek fda approval of aloxi injection for prevention of ponv and aloxi capsules for prevention of cinv 
helsinn will continue to fund and conduct all registration directed development of aloxi products for the new applications 
dacogen injection in september  we obtained exclusive worldwide rights to the development  commercialization  manufacturing and distribution of dacogen tm decitabine injection for all indications from supergen  inc under the terms of the agreement  we incurred million in license expense in and we expect to make additional license payments of million over the course of the next several years upon achievement of certain development milestones culminating with marketing approvals and commercialization of dacogen injection 
dacogen injection is an investigational anti cancer therapeutic which is currently in development for the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome mds 
dacogen injection new drug applications for the treatment of mds are being reviewed for marketing approval by the fda in the united states and the emea in europe 
a pivotal phase trial and two supporting phase trials for the mds indication form the clinical basis of these applications 
the fda has established september  as the prescription drug user fee act pdufa action goal date for the nda 
we have assumed financial responsibility for all further development of dacogen injection and we committed to fund at least million of dacogen injection development costs by september   of which million was incurred by december  given the broad hematologic activity of dacogen injection  we intend to initiate a pivotal phase program during in patients with acute myeloid leukemia aml 
acylfulvene product candidates in  we obtained exclusive worldwide rights to the acylfulvene family of compounds from the regents of the university of california 
irofulven  the lead product candidate is a novel  broadly active cytotoxic agent 
in clinical trials of irofulven as a single agent  activity has been observed in prostate  liver  ovarian and pancreatic cancers 
in clinical trials of irofulven in combination with currently marketed chemotherapies  activity has been seen in prostate  colorectal and thyroid cancers 
the most advanced of the combination trials is a phase  multi arm  randomized combination trial of irofulven combination with capecitabine either with or without prednisone in hormone refractory prostate cancer hrpc patients previously treated with docetaxel 
mg and dna mt in a december amendment to the methylgene license agreement license agreement  methylgene acknowledged full satisfaction of our then current payment obligations and suspended further payment obligations by us until after completion by methylgene of a planned clinical trial with mg if we resume development  our financial responsibilities under the license agreement would also resume 
we agreed with methylgene to terminate the small molecule inhibitor of dna methyltransferase portion of our license relationship and those rights reverted back to methylgene without any additional payments by either party 
for information about the commercial status  target diseases and the development of our drug compounds  refer to the product overview table contained in part i  item i of this form k 
in general  the estimated times to completion within the various stages of clinical development are as follows clinical phase estimated completion time phase years phase years phase years due to the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in preclinical tests and clinical trials associated with each of our research and development projects  the cost to complete such projects as well as the timing of product marketing and sales is not reasonably estimable 
the data obtained from these tests and trials may be susceptible to varying interpretation that could delay  limit or prevent a project s advancement through the various stages of clinical development 
the actual probability of success for each drug candidate and clinical program will be impacted by a variety of factors  including the biologic activity of the molecule  the validity of the target and disease indication  early clinical data  patient accrual  investment in the program  competition and commercial viability 
acquired in process research and development the acquired in process research and development represents product candidate compounds acquired as a result of the acquisitions of aesgen  inc and zycos  inc 
the product candidate compounds are currently under development  have not yet achieved regulatory approval for marketing and have no alternative future use 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these acquisitions 
interest income and expense interest income and expense for the years ended december   and are summarized in the following table the year ended december  in thousands  except percentage change change interest income interest expense interest income increased percent to million in and increased percent to million in from million in funds available for investment in increased as a result of the issuance of senior subordinated convertible notes in the first quarter of the increase from to is a result of increases in the average amount of funds available for investment as a result of the sale of stock in the third quarter partially reduced by declining yields 
interest income for will fluctuate depending on the timing of cash flows and changes in interest rates for marketable securities 
interest expense increased to million in and increased to million in from million in the increase from to resulted from the issuance of senior subordinated convertible notes in the first quarter of we expect interest expense related to this convertible debt for to be approximately million  of which million will be paid using cash 
the non cash portion of interest expense is related to the amortization of issuance costs on our convertible debt 
the increase from to resulted from a full year of interest expense in related to our issuance of convertible debt in the fourth quarter of this convertible debt was fully converted in the first quarter of see note of the company s notes to consolidated financial statements 
our interest expense would increase if we issue new debt securities 
impairment of investment we own an approximate percent  investment in methylgene inc  a canada based biopharmaceutical company 
methylgene completed its initial public offering and began trading publicly on the toronto stock exchange on june  prior to methylgene becoming a publicly traded company  our minority investment in methylgene was reported as a long term equity investment at the lower of its cost  or if its value was other than temporarily impaired  then at its estimated fair value 
we reviewed its fair value on a periodic basis 
until methylgene became publicly traded  the value of this investment was inherently more difficult to estimate than an investment in a public company 
in november of  methylgene  inc management negotiated a financing term sheet at arms length that indicated the value of our investment had declined from its original cost of million to million as of december  and an impairment of this investment had occurred which was considered to be other than temporary 
although  methylgene s board of directors ultimately rejected the financing terms  these terms provided the best available estimate of fair value for our investment in methylgene and accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the year ended december  tax expense tax expense of  in represents alternative minimum tax 
there is no provision for tax expense in  or due to net losses of million and million  respectively 
our ability to achieve profitable operations is dependent upon our continued successful commercialization of aloxi injection  among other things  and therefore  we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
if and when it is judged to be more likely than not that we will utilize our deferred tax assets  the related valuation allowance will be reduced and a tax benefit will be recorded  and the portion of the allowance pertaining to the exercise of stock options will increase additional paid in capital 
then for subsequent tax periods  our tax provision would likely reflect normal statutory tax rates  and utilization of our deferred tax attributes would reduce our deferred tax asset balance 
the timing of this valuation allowance adjustment is primarily dependent upon continued growth in sales of aloxi injection and the demonstration of a number of consecutive quarters of profitability 
net loss we had net losses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increased net loss from to reflects a percent increase in revenues and a percent increase in costs and expenses from to cost and expenses in include million of acquired in process research and development expense related to acquisitions 
the increased net loss from to reflects a percent increase in revenues and a percent increase in costs and expenses from to during the next several years  we expect to direct our efforts towards activities intended to grow long term revenues  including the continued development and commercialization of aloxi products and continued development of our other product candidates 
we expect net income for to be approximately million exclusive of the effect of the scheduled implementation of fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment and exclusive of increases in net loss that would result from expanding our product portfolio 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable debt investments of million compared with million and million at december  and  respectively 
we had working capital of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities net cash used in operations was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in operating activities from to was primarily due to an increase in net loss and accounts receivable  offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the million increase in accounts receivable is a result of growing sales of aloxi injection and longer payment terms being offered on sales of aloxi injection 
future trends in our accounts receivable balances will largely depend upon the competing effects of continued growth in sales of aloxi injection and reducing the period of time for payment to become due following its sale 
the increase in cash used in operations from to was primarily a result of a larger net loss  increase in inventories and receivables and a decrease of deferred revenue offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expense 
the launch of aloxi injection resulted in increased inventories  receivables and accrued expenses 
net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  the increase in cash used from to was primarily due to purchases of certain net assets of million in connection with the aesgen and zycos business acquisitions see note of the company s notes to consolidated financial statements and the purchase of an equity investment of million in supergen in connection with the dacogen injection license agreement see note of the company s notes to consolidated financial statements 
net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  we received million in cash from the issuance of senior subordinated convertible notes and million in cash from the issuance of shares under stock award plans 
this total was reduced by the net purchase of million of restricted marketable securities  which were pledged as security for the first six scheduled interest payments related to issuance of convertible debt 
in  we received million in cash from the issuance of  shares of common stock in a follow on public offering  and million in cash from issuance of shares under stock award plans 
our cash use in will depend in part upon the pattern of aloxi injection sales 
we expect the aloxi injection sales to increase for  which will result in increased working capital deployed for aloxi injection finished product inventory and receivables 
however  as sales increase we expect our operations to generate positive cash flow 
we expect cash provided by operations in to be approximately million 
our overall change in cash will depend upon our investing and financing activities and the change may be an increase or decrease 
substantial amounts of capital may be needed to continue growing our business 
these capital needs will include funding of continued expansion of our product portfolio through various means such as additional product acquisitions or business combinations 
these transactions will require the use of capital and their timing is difficult to predict 
our capital needs may exceed the capital available from our future operations  collaborative arrangements and existing liquid assets 
for these needs or in anticipation of these needs  we may seek capital from additional equity or debt issuances 
as identified in our risk factors  adverse changes that affect future demand for our marketed products  continued access to the capital markets  and continued development and expansion of our product candidates would affect our longer term liquidity 
payment obligations our future  noncancellable  contractual commitments  are summarized in the following table in thousands thereafter total operating lease payments convertible debt dacogen milestone a dacogen minimum development obligation b helsinn minimum sales obligation c total a development milestone earned in related to the filing of the nda for dacogen injection with the fda that was paid in the first quarter of b in connection with the september in licensing agreement with supergen where we obtained the exclusive worldwide rights for dacogen decitabine injection  we committed to fund at least million of further dacogen injection development costs by september   of which million was incurred in c in connection with the april in licensing agreement with helsinn healthcare sa where we obtained the exclusive us and canadian oncology license and distribution rights for aloxi injection  we agreed to pay minimum payments over the first ten years following commercialization 
the minimum is only payable to the extent that it exceeds the actual payments that would otherwise be payable under the agreement 
minimum sales targets of aloxi injection for prevention of cinv peak at approximately million in the fourth year of commercialization 
we expect to make additional payments to helsinn related to aloxi product candidates totaling million and to supergen related to dacogen injection totaling million over the course of the next several years upon achievement of certain development milestones 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as such term is defined in item of regulation s k that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
cautionary statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information without fear of litigation so long as those statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the statement 
we desire to take advantage of these safe harbor provisions and accordingly  we hereby identify the following important factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from any such results which may be projected  forecasted  estimated or budgeted by us in forward looking statements made by us from time to time in reports  proxy statements  registration statements and other written communications  or in oral forward looking statements made from time to time by the company s officers and agents 
we do not intend to update any of these forward looking statements after the date of this form k to conform them to actual results 
risks related to our business sales of aloxi injection account for a significant and growing portion of our product revenues 
our business is dependent on the commercial success of aloxi injection 
if any factor adversely affects sales of aloxi injection  we may be unable to continue our operations as planned 
aloxi injection sales represented and percent of our total product sales and and percent of our total revenue for the year ended december  and year ended december   respectively 
any factor adversely affecting sales of aloxi injection could cause our product revenues to decrease and our stock price to decline significantly 
the success of our business is dependent on the continued successful commercialization of aloxi injection 
aloxi injection is relatively new to the market and its long term acceptance by the oncology community will depend largely on our ability to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of aloxi injection as an alternative to other therapies 
we cannot be certain that aloxi injection will provide benefits considered adequate by providers of oncology services or that enough providers will use the product to ensure its continued commercial success 
the fda subjects an approved product and its manufacturer to continual regulatory review 
after approval and use in an increasing number of patients  the discovery of previously unknown problems  such as unacceptable toxicities or side effects  with a product may result in restrictions or sanctions on the product or manufacturer that could affect the commercial viability of the product or could require withdrawal of the product from the market 
further  we must continually submit any labeling  advertising and promotional material to the fda for review 
there is risk that the fda will prohibit use of the marketing material in the form we desire 
unfavorable outcomes resulting from factors such as those identified above could limit sales of aloxi injection or cause sales of aloxi injection to decline 
in those circumstances  our stock price would decline and we may have to find additional sources of funding or scale back or cease operations 
we have a history of net losses 
if we do not have net income in the future  we may be unable to continue our operations 
we have a very limited history of profitability 
we expect to incur significant expenses over the next several years as we devote substantial resources to support of the development efforts of aloxi products through milestone payments to helsinn  the continued development of other product candidates  including zyca  saforis oral suspension  dacogen injection and irofulven  continued commercialization of aloxi injection and our other marketed products and acquire additional product candidates or companies 
therefore  we may not reliably generate net income unless we are able to increase sales of aloxi injection or other products compared to our current sales  and we may be unable to fund development of our product candidates or to continue our business operations as planned 
generic pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets were introduced into the united states in december our sales of salagen tablets pilocarpine hydrochloride in the united states  which totaled million in the year ended december   are likely to decline significantly for subsequent years 
beginning in december generic milligram pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets entered the united states markets where salagen tablets pilocarpine hydrochloride competes 
we expect our annual sales of salagen tablets beginning in to decline significantly from our sales of million in the united states 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly  which may adversely affect our stock price 
if our operating results do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts  our stock price may decline 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to a variety of factors including the acceptance of  and demand for  aloxi injection  changing demand for our other products  particularly salagen tablets  third parties introducing competing products  the pace and breadth of our development programs  expenditures we incur to acquire  license  develop or promote additional products  expenditures we incur and assume in business acquisitions  availability of product supply from third party manufacturers  changes in sales and marketing expenditures  and the timing of licensing and royalty revenues 
for the year ended december   we had a net loss of million inclusive of million of acquired in process research and development expense related to acquisitions  compared to net losses of and million for each of the years ended december   and december   respectively 
within  our sequential quarterly results were a net loss of million  net income of million and net losses of million and million  respectively 
variations in the timing of our future revenues and expenses could cause significant fluctuations in our operating results from period to period and may result in unanticipated earnings shortfalls or losses 
our effective tax rate  if any  may vary significantly from period to period  especially within the first few years of becoming profitable and increases in our effective tax rate would have a negative effect on our results of operations 
we have had no or minimal provision for tax expense for a number of years due to a history of incurring significant losses 
our ability to achieve profitable operations is dependent upon our continued successful commercialization of aloxi injection  and therefore we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
if and when it is judged to be more likely than not that we will be able to utilize our deferred tax assets  the valuation allowance will be reduced and a tax benefit will be recorded 
for subsequent tax periods  our tax provision would likely approximate normal statutory tax rates 
a transition to an effective tax rate that approximates statutory tax rates could result in an increase in effective tax rate from less than percent to approximately percent 
an increase of this magnitude would result in a significant reduction in our net income and income per share beginning with the quarter of implementation 
even if we begin reporting an effective tax rate that approximates statutory tax rates  various factors may continue to have favorable or unfavorable effects on our effective tax rate 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in overall levels of income before taxes  interpretations of existing tax laws  changes in tax laws and rates  future levels of research and development spending  future levels of capital expenditures  and changes in the mix of activity in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
an increase in our effective tax rate would reduce our net income and income per share 
clinical trials are complex and unpredictable and may be difficult to complete or produce unexpected results that could delay or prevent our ability to commercialize our product candidates 
before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product under development  including irofulven  dacogen injection  saforis oral suspension or zyca  we  or helsinn healthcare sa  in the case of the aloxi products  must demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that the product is safe and effective for use in each target indication 
we depend on collaboration with helsinn healthcare sa  supergen  inc  medical institutions and laboratories to conduct our clinical and preclinical testing in compliance with good clinical and laboratory practices as required by the fda 
we  or helsinn healthcare sa  may depend on contract research organizations to manage a substantial portion of the medical institutions utilized to conduct clinical testing 
the results from preclinical animal studies and human clinical trials may not be predictive of the results that will be obtained in large scale testing 
some of the results reported from clinical trials are interim results and may not be predictive of future results  including final results from such trials  because  among other factors  patient enrollment and the time period for evaluating patient results are not complete 
if we  or helsinn healthcare sa  fail to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a product candidate  the fda would not provide regulatory approval of the product 
the appearance of unacceptable toxicities or side effects during clinical trials could interrupt  limit  delay or abort the development of a product 
a number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after experiencing promising results in previous animal and human studies 
the time required to complete clinical trials is dependent upon  among other factors  the rate of patient enrollment 
patient enrollment is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the nature of clinical protocol requirements  the diversion of patients to other trials or marketed therapies  our ability to recruit and manage clinical centers and associated trials  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  and the patient eligibility criteria for the trial 
other factors  such as lack of efficacy and unacceptable toxicities  may result in increased costs and delays or termination of clinical trials prior to completion 
in addition  delays in manufacturing of product for our clinical trials could impact our ability to complete our clinical trials as planned 
any failure to meet expectations related to our product candidates could adversely affect our stock price 
since our product candidates such as dacogen injection  saforis oral suspension  zyca and irofulven may have alternative development paths and we have limited resources  our focus on a particular development path for these product candidates may result in our failure to capitalize on more profitable areas and may not result in viable products 
we have limited financial and product development resources 
this requires us to focus on product candidates in specific areas and forego opportunities with regard to other product candidates or development paths 
for example  one of our product candidates  irofulven  is in clinical and preclinical trials for a number of applications 
we expect that a portion of our product development efforts over the next several years will be devoted to further development of irofulven  including its application to the treatment of cancers or sub populations of certain types of cancers with limited therapeutic options such as refractory cancers  for which we believe irofulven could most quickly be developed and approved for marketing 
we are also investigating the efficacy of irofulven in combination with other cancer therapies 
while some of these trials have indicated some effectiveness in relation to the target medical conditions  additional clinical trials must be conducted before product registration may be requested 
alternative examples of resource trade offs also exist for our other product candidates 
if we fail to identify  develop and successfully commercialize applications for our product candidates  we may not achieve expectations of our future performance and our stock price may decline 
for example  in april we stopped enrollment in our phase trial of irofulven in advanced stage  gemcitabine refractory pancreatic cancer patients and our stock price declined significantly 
in addition  we may focus our development on a particular application that may result in our failure to capitalize on another application or another product candidate 
our decisions impacting resource allocation may not lead to the development of viable commercial products and may divert resources away from more profitable market opportunities 
our customer base is highly concentrated 
bankruptcy of any of our customers would adversely affect our financial condition and fluctuations in their purchases of our products would cause volatility in our results of operations 
our principal customers  specialty distributors and wholesalers  comprise a significant part of the distribution network for oncology injectables and pharmaceutical products in the united states 
if any of these customers becomes insolvent or disputes payment of the amount it owes us  it would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
further  fluctuations in customer buying patterns and their amount of inventory of our products could cause volatility in our results of operations and materially  adversely impact our results of operations 
we depend on a single supplier to provide us with the finished drug product for aloxi injection and a single supplier to provide us with the active ingredient for the production of salagen tablets 
if either supplier terminates its relationship with us  or is unable to fill our demand for the ingredients or products  we may be unable to sell those products 
we rely on helsinn birex pharmaceuticals ltd 
as our sole and exclusive supplier of the aloxi injection finished drug product 
in addition  we rely on merck kgaa as our sole and exclusive supplier of oral grade pilocarpine hydrochloride  the active ingredient in salagen tablets 
the refined raw material for salagen tablets is a semi synthetic salt of an extract from plants grown and processed exclusively on merck s plantations in south america 
to our knowledge  there is currently no other producer of oral grade pilocarpine hydrochloride that is capable of meeting our commercial needs 
if our relationship with helsinn birex pharmaceuticals ltd 
or merck kgaa terminates  or helsinn birex pharmaceuticals ltd 
or merck kgaa is unable to meet our needs for any reason  we will need to find an alternative source of the active ingredients and products supplied by those companies 
if we are unable to identify an alternative source  we may be unable to continue offering aloxi injection or salagen tablets for commercial sale 
even if we were able to procure adequate supplies of aloxi injection finished drug product or pilocarpine hydrochloride from an alternative source  any disruption in supply could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand for aloxi injection or salagen tablets for commercial sale  which would cause our product revenues to decrease and our stock price to decline 
if the third party manufacturer of aloxi injection or salagen tablets or any of our other products ceases operations or fails to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations  we may not be able to meet customer demand in a timely manner  if at all 
we do not have manufacturing facilities and we rely on helsinn birex pharmaceuticals ltd 
for the production of aloxi injection  patheon inc for the production of salagen tablets  and other third party manufacturers for our other products 
we intend to continue to rely on others to manufacture any future products  including any products that we may acquire or license  and we have no plans to establish manufacturing facilities 
our dependence on third parties for the manufacture of our products may adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver such products 
the manufacture of our products is  and will be  subject to current good manufacturing practices regulations enforced by the fda or other standards prescribed by the appropriate regulatory agency in the country of use 
there is a risk that the manufacturers of our products  including the current manufacturers of aloxi injection and salagen tablets  will not comply with all applicable regulatory standards  and may not be able to manufacture aloxi injection  salagen tablets  or any other product for commercial sale 
if this occurs  we might not be able to identify another third party manufacturer on terms acceptable to us  or any other terms 
material changes to an approved product  such as manufacturing changes or additional labeling claims  require further fda review and approval 
even after approval is obtained  the fda may withdraw approval if previously unknown problems are discovered 
further  if we  our corporate collaborators or our contract manufacturers fail to comply with applicable fda and other regulatory requirements at any stage during the regulatory or manufacturing process  the fda may impose sanctions  including marketing or manufacturing delays  warning letters  fines  product recalls or seizures  injunctions  refusal of the fda to review pending market approval applications or supplements to approval applications  total or partial suspension of production  civil penalties  withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications  or criminal prosecutions 
our business strategy depends on our ability to identify  acquire  license and develop product candidates and identify  acquire or license approved products 
as part of our business strategy we plan to identify  acquire  license and develop product candidates and identify  acquire and license approved products for markets that we can reach through our marketing and distribution channels 
if we fail to obtain  develop and successfully commercialize additional products  we may not achieve expectations of our future performance and our stock price could decline 
because we do not materially engage in basic research or drug discovery  we must rely upon third parties to sell or license product opportunities to us 
other companies  including some with substantially greater financial  marketing and sales resources  are competing with us to acquire or license such products or product candidates 
we may not be able to acquire or license rights to additional products or product candidates on acceptable terms  if at all 
furthermore  we may not be able to successfully develop any product candidates we acquire or license 
in addition  we may acquire or license new products with different marketing strategies  distribution channels and bases of competition than those of our current products 
therefore  we may not be able to compete favorably in those product categories 
we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions with zycos and aesgen 
during the third quarter of  we acquired zycos and aesgen 
the success of these mergers will depend  in part  on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies and growth opportunities from integrating the businesses 
the integration of independent companies is a complex  costly and time consuming process 
the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include  among others retaining key employees  coordinating research and development activities  consolidating corporate and administrative functions  minimizing the diversion of management s attention from ongoing business concerns  and coordinating geographically separate organizations 
in addition  even if we are able to successfully integrate  the integrations may not result in the realization of the full benefits of development and growth opportunities that we currently expect or that these benefits will be achieved within the anticipated time frame 
our failure to achieve these benefits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may need to obtain additional capital to grow our business and complete our product portfolio development and expansion plans 
issuance of new securities may dilute the interests of our stockholders and constrain our operating flexibility 
we may need to raise additional funds for various reasons including the following to expand our portfolio of marketed products and product candidates  to develop products we have acquired or licensed  to obtain necessary working capital  and to fund operating losses 
adequate funds for these purposes may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
insufficient funds may cause us to delay  scale back  or abandon some or all of our product acquisition and licensing programs and product development programs 
we may seek additional funding through public and private financing  including equity and debt financing or enter into collaborative arrangements 
any sale of additional convertible debt securities or equity securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders and any debt financing may require us to pledge our assets and enter into restrictive covenants 
entry into collaborative arrangements may require us to give up rights to some of our products or to some potential markets or to enter into licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms 
if we are unable to maintain relationships with third party collaborators or enter into new relationships  we may not be able to develop any of our product candidates or commercialize our products in a timely manner  if at all 
our continued success will depend in large part upon the efforts of third parties 
for the research  development  manufacture and commercialization of our products  we currently have  and will likely continue to enter into  various arrangements with other corporations  licensors  licensees  outside researchers  consultants and others 
however  we cannot be certain of the actions these parties will take  and there is a risk that we will be unable to negotiate acceptable collaborative arrangements to develop or commercialize our products  any arrangements with third parties will not be successful  third party collaborators will not fulfill their obligations to us under any arrangements entered into with them  strategic collaborators  including helsinn healthcare sa  will terminate their relationship with us  or current or potential collaborators will pursue treatments for other diseases or seek alternative means of developing treatments for the diseases targeted by our programs or products 
our third party collaborators include public research institutions  research organizations  teaching and research hospitals  community based clinics  testing laboratories  contract product formulation organizations  contract packaging and distribution companies  manufacturers  suppliers and license collaborators 
we consider our arrangements with helsinn healthcare sa  patheon inc  and merck kgaa  supergen  inc 
to be significant 
if any of our collaborators breaches or terminates its agreement with us  or otherwise fails to conduct its collaborative activities in a timely manner  we may experience significant delays in the development or commercialization of the products or product candidates or the research program covered by the agreement and we may need to devote additional funds or other resources to these activities 
if we are unable to enter into new or alternative arrangements to continue research and development activities  or are unable to continue these activities on our own  we may have to terminate the development program 
as a consequence  we may experience a loss of future commercial product potential and a decline in our stock price 
we have licensed the right to promote  sell and distribute aloxi products in the united states and canada from a third party 
we are particularly dependent on that third party for our ability to commercialize aloxi products 
we have entered a license agreement with helsinn healthcare sa under which we have acquired a license to sell and distribute aloxi products in the united states and canada through december  furthermore  under the terms of our license  we are required to purchase all of our aloxi products from helsinn birex pharmaceutical  ltd 
the license agreement may be terminated for specified reasons  including if the other party is in substantial or persistent breach of the agreement  if we have experienced a change of control and the acquiring entity has competing products or our marketing and sales related commitments to the licensor are not maintained by the acquiring entity  or if either party has declared bankruptcy 
although we are not currently in breach of the license  and we believe that helsinn healthcare sa is not currently in breach of the license  there is a risk that either party could breach the license in the future 
in addition  if we were to breach the supply agreement with helsinn birex pharmaceutical ltd 
contemplated by the license  helsinn healthcare sa would be permitted to terminate the license 
if the license agreement were terminated  we would lose all of our rights to sell and distribute aloxi products  as well as all of the related intellectual property and all regulatory approvals 
in addition  helsinn healthcare sa holds the rights to palonosetron the active ingredient in aloxi products through an agreement with syntex usa inc and f 
hoffmann la roche ag 
we cannot be certain of the actions that these parties will take  and there is a risk that these third parties will end their relationship  which would leave us without rights to the pharmaceutical preparations  products and know how required to produce aloxi products 
as a consequence of such a termination  we would lose all of our rights to sell and distribute aloxi products  which would harm our business and could cause our stock price to decline significantly 
we rely on multinational and foreign pharmaceutical companies to develop and commercialize our products and product candidates in markets outside the united states 
with respect to products in which we own rights outside the united states  we have entered into alliances with various multinational and foreign pharmaceutical companies related to the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates in markets outside the united states 
our continued relationships with strategic collaborators are dependent in part on the successful achievement of development milestones 
if we or our collaborators do not achieve these milestones  or we are unable to enter into agreements with our collaborators to modify their terms  these agreements could terminate  which could cause a loss of licensing revenue  a loss of future commercial product potential and a decline in our stock price 
we recognize licensing revenue from our marketing collaborators as a portion of our total revenue 
future licensing revenues from these collaborators will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on the achievement of milestones by us or our collaborators  the amount of product sales and royalty generating activities  the timing of initiating additional licensing relationships  and our continuing obligation related to license payments 
if we fail to compete successfully with our competitors  our product revenues could decrease and our stock price could decline 
competition in the pharmaceutical industry is intense 
most of our competitors are large  multinational pharmaceutical companies that have considerably greater financial  sales  marketing and technical resources than we do 
most of our present and potential competitors also have dedicated research and development capabilities that may allow them to develop new or improved products that compete with our products 
currently  aloxi injection competes with three other products from the ht receptor antagonist class of compounds  as well as products from other chemical classes that are also used for the prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting 
these products are marketed by glaxosmithkline  roche  aventis and merck  large multinational competitors 
if aloxi injection does not compete successfully with existing products on the market  our stock price could decline significantly 
additionally  medimmune  inc and daichi pharmaceutical have drugs that are approved for sale and compete in the same markets as salagen tablets 
other pharmaceutical companies are developing products  which  if approved by the fda  will compete directly with our products 
our competitors could also develop and introduce generic drugs comparable to our products  or drugs or other therapies that address the underlying causes of the symptoms that our products treat 
if a product developed by a competitor is more effective than our product  or priced lower than our product  then our product revenue could decrease and our stock price could decline 
we are dependent on our key personnel 
if we are not able to attract and retain key employees and consultants  our product development  marketing and commercialization plans could be harmed 
we are highly dependent on the members of our scientific  commercial and management staff 
if we are not able to retain any of these persons  our product development  marketing and commercialization plans may suffer and our stock price could decline 
none of our executive officers has an employment agreement with us 
if we are unable to retain our scientific  commercial and management staff  we will need to hire additional qualified personnel for us to pursue our product acquisition  development  marketing and commercialization plans 
we may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms  given the competition for such personnel among biotechnology  pharmaceutical and healthcare companies  universities and non profit research institutions 
if we are not able to attract and retain qualified personnel  our product acquisition  development  marketing and commercialization plans will suffer and our stock price could decline 
if we are unable to keep up with rapid technological changes in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries  we may be unable to continue our operations 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have experienced rapid and significant technological change 
we expect that pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology will continue to develop rapidly 
our future success will depend  in large part  on our ability to develop and maintain technology that is competitive 
if other companies achieve technological advances with their products or obtain fda approval before we are able to obtain such approval  our products may become obsolete before they are marketed or before we recover any of our development and commercialization expenses incurred with respect to such products 
in addition  alternative therapies or new medical treatments could alter existing treatment regimens  and thereby reduce the need for one or more of our products  which could result in the termination of the development in one or more of our product candidates  or in the decline in sales of one of our approved products  which could cause our stock price to decline 
risks related to our industry if we do not receive regulatory approvals for our product candidates  or if regulatory approval is delayed for any reason  we will be unable to commercialize and sell our products as we expect 
prior to marketing  each of our product candidates must undergo an extensive regulatory approval process conducted by the fda in the united states and by comparable agencies in other countries 
the product development and approval process can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources 
there is risk that the fda or a foreign regulatory authority will not approve in a timely manner  if at all  any product we develop 
generally  the fda approves for sale only a very small percentage of newly discovered pharmaceutical compounds that enter preclinical development 
we may encounter delays or denials in regulatory approvals due to changes in fda policy during the period of development  or changes in the requirements for regulatory review of each submitted new drug application  or nda 
there is also risk that regulatory authorities in the united states and elsewhere may not allow us to conduct planned additional clinical testing of any of our product candidates  including irofulven  dacogen injection  saforis oral suspension  zyca or aloxi products  or that  if permitted  this additional clinical testing will not prove that these product candidates are safe and effective to the extent necessary to permit us to obtain marketing approvals from regulatory authorities 
except for dacogen injection  saforis oral suspension and our products already approved  none of our product candidates are currently being tested in phase or registration clinical trials 
we cannot apply for a regulatory approval to market a product candidate until we successfully complete phase or registration clinical trials for that product 
if we are unable to obtain intellectual property protection  or protect our proprietary technology  we may be unable to compete effectively 
the fda awarded us orphan drug status for salagen tablets in as a treatment for the symptoms of xerostomia  or severe dry mouth  induced by radiation therapy in head and neck cancer patients and in for the symptoms of dry mouth associated with sj gren s syndrome 
an orphan drug designation entitles us to marketing exclusivity of the protected drug for the stated condition for a period of seven years 
our orphan drug protection for salagen tablets expired in march for the treatment of symptoms of radiation induced xerostomia in head and neck cancer patients and will expired in february for the sj gren s syndrome indication 
beginning in december  generic milligram pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets entered the united states markets where salagen tablets compete and we have suspended direct promotion of salagen tablets 
if the introduction of these competing products adheres to the classic pattern of initial generic competition in a pharmaceutical product class  we would expect salagen tablets sales to decline significantly from our sales of million in the united states 
we hold an exclusive united states and canada license on patents covering aloxi injection proprietary rights 
in addition  we hold an exclusive  worldwide license on patents and patent applications covering acylfulvene proprietary rights  including irofulven 
the license applicable to these technologies is subject to certain statutory rights held by the us government 
even though we have licensed these patents  we may not have exclusive rights to all possible acylfulvene analogs  all possible methods of using acylfulvene analogs to treat tumors or all possible synthetic methods for preparing acylfulvenes 
in addition  we licensed rights to patents and patent applications covering mg protection of these rights and creation of additional rights involve joint responsibilities between us and the respective license party 
we have recently acquired rights to patents and patent applications covering technologies that were owned by or licensed to zycos  inc  and aesgen  inc  and those rights that were licensed from third parties were assigned to us in those transactions 
we have also recently obtained a worldwide  exclusive license of certain rights to patents and patent applications covering technologies that are owned by supergen  inc  or licensed to supergen  inc  from third parties 
our pending patent applications  those we may file in the future  or those we license from third parties  may not result in patents being issued 
patents  if issued  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
in addition  other entities may develop similar technologies that fall outside the scope of our patents 
thus  any patent rights that we own or license from third parties may not provide sufficient protection against potential competitors 
in the event that our technologies or methods used in the course of developing or selling our products infringe the patents or violate other proprietary rights of third parties  we and our corporate collaborators may be prevented from pursuing product development or commercialization 
in addition to patents  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how 
we protect our proprietary technology and processes in part by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators  employees and consultants 
there is a risk that these confidentiality agreements will be breached  we will not have adequate remedies for any breach of these agreements  our trade secrets will otherwise become known  or our trade secrets will be independently discovered and used by competitors 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have been characterized by litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
if we become involved in any litigation  interference or other administrative proceedings  we will incur substantial expense and the efforts of our technical and management personnel will be diverted 
an adverse determination may subject us to significant liabilities or require us to cease using the technology or to seek licenses that may not be available from third parties on commercially favorable terms  if at all  or to cease manufacturing and selling our products 
this could cause us to terminate the development of one or more of our product candidates  to discontinue marketing an existing product  or to pay royalties to a third party 
any of these events could result in a decline in the price of our stock 
if the use of one of our products harms people  we may be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims 
we face exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our product is alleged to have harmed someone 
although we have taken  and continue to take  what we believe are appropriate precautions  there is a risk that we will not be able to avoid significant product liability exposure 
we currently have product liability insurance in the amount of million per occurrence and in the aggregate for the year 
there is a risk that our insurance will not be sufficient to cover claims 
there is also a risk that adequate insurance coverage will not be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the successful assertion of an uninsured product liability or other claim against us could cause us to incur a significant expense to pay such a claim  could adversely affect our product development and could cause a decline in our product revenue and the price of our stock 
in addition to product liability risks associated with sales of our products  we may be liable to the claims of individuals who participate in clinical trials of our products 
a number of patients who participate in trials are already critically ill when they enter a trial 
the waivers we obtain may not be enforceable and may not protect us from liability or the costs of product liability litigation 
our product liability insurance may not provide adequate protection against potential liabilities 
moreover  we may not be able to maintain our insurance on acceptable terms 
as a result of these factors  a product liability claim  even if successfully defended  could cause us to incur a significant expense to defend such a claim  could adversely affect our product development and could cause a decline in our product revenue and the price of our stock 
we could become the subject of legal proceedings or investigations that could result in substantial fines  penalties  injunctive or administrative penalties and criminal charges  which would increase our expenses and redirect management s attention away from business operations 
our business operations are subject to a wide range of laws and regulations 
other pharmaceutical companies have been the subjects of legal proceedings or investigations related to pricing  marketing  promotional and clinical trial practices 
if we become the subject of legal proceedings or investigations  our expenses would increase and commercialization of our products could be adversely affected 
further  management s attention would be diverted from our business operations 
if we issue a product recall  we may not sell as much of our products in the future and we may incur significant expenses 
the fda or other government agencies having regulatory authority for product sales may request product recalls or we may issue product recalls 
these product recalls may occur due to manufacturing issues  safety concerns or other reasons 
we do not carry any insurance to cover the risk of a product recall 
any product recall could have a material adverse effect on our product revenue and could cause the price of our stock to decline 
if we or patients using our products are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other organizations  our product sales and price of our stock could decline 
there is uncertainty about the reimbursement status of healthcare products 
our profitability will depend in part on the price we are able to charge for our products  and the availability of adequate reimbursement for our products to providers from third party payors  such as government entities  private health insurers and managed care organizations 
federal and state regulations govern or influence the reimbursement status of healthcare products in many situations and third party payors are increasingly challenging the pricing of medical products and services 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of together with rulemaking by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms require a number of changes in medicare practices  including reimbursement 
the changes made to date are not expected to have an adverse affect on our operations  sales or the price of our stock  but we cannot predict the impact  if any of future provider reimbursement changes 
salagen tablets and aloxi injection generally have been eligible for reimbursement to providers from third party payors and we have applied for  or in certain cases already received confirmation of  reimbursement eligibility for providers for aloxi injection 
third party reimbursement is important to the commercialization of our products 
if government entities and other third party payors do not provide adequate reimbursement levels to providers for our products  our product and license revenues would be materially and adversely affected and our stock price could decline 
in recent years  various parties have proposed a number of legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing national healthcare systems 
in the united states  we expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement government control of pricing and profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals 
cost controls  if mandated by a government agency  could decrease the price that we receive for our current or future products 
these proposals  if enacted  could have a material adverse effect on our product and license revenues and could cause our stock price to decline 
in certain countries  regulatory authorities must also approve the sales price of a product after they grant marketing approval 
there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain satisfactory prices in foreign markets even if we obtain marketing approval from foreign regulatory authorities 
our operations  and the operations of our third party contractors  involve hazardous materials that could expose us to liability if environmental damage occurs 
our operations and the operations of our third party contractors involve the controlled use of hazardous materials 
we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
in the event of an accident or environmental discharge  third parties may hold us liable for any resulting damages  which may exceed our financial resources and may have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our operations 
risks related to our outstanding securities our stock price is volatile  which may result in significant losses to stockholders and holders of our convertible notes 
the market price for our convertible notes will be significantly impacted by the price of our common stock  which has historically been volatile 
there has been significant volatility in the market prices of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies securities 
various factors and events may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock  and some of these factors are beyond our control 
these factors include fluctuations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations or acquisitions or licensing of therapeutic products or product candidates by us or our competitors  published reports by securities analysts  positive or negative progress with our clinical trials  governmental regulation  including healthcare reimbursement policies  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  developments in our relationship with collaborators and suppliers  and announcements of new strategic collaborations  public concern as to the safety and efficacy of our products  and general market conditions 
the trading price of our common stock has been  and could continue to be  subject to wide fluctuations in response to these factors  including the sale or attempted sale of a large amount of our common stock into the market 
our stock price ranged from to per share during the three year period ended december  broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following large falls in the price of a company s shares  securities class action litigation has often been initiated against that company 
litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of management s attention and resources  which could harm our business 
any adverse determination in litigation could subject us to significant liabilities 
we have outstanding options and convertible notes that have the potential to dilute stockholder value and cause our stock value to decline 
we routinely grant stock options to our employees and other individuals 
at december   we had options outstanding at option prices ranging from to for  shares of our common stock that have been registered for resale 
we have also issued convertible debt that is convertible into  shares of common stock at an initial conversion price of per share of common stock 
conversion is contingent on a number of factors that have not yet been satisfied 
consequently  we are not able to estimate when  if ever  the convertible debt will be converted into common stock  but any such conversion would almost certainly dilute stockholder value 
if some or all of such shares are sold into the public market over a short time period  the value of our stock is likely to decline  as the market may not be able to absorb those shares at the prevailing market prices 
such sales may also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future on terms that we deem acceptable 
our convertible notes are subordinated and we may incur additional debt 
our convertible notes are subordinated in right of payment to all of our senior indebtedness 
as a result  in the event of our bankruptcy  liquidation or reorganization or upon acceleration of the notes due to an event of default under the indenture governing the notes and in certain other events  our assets will be available to pay obligations on the notes only after all senior indebtedness has been paid in full 
in addition  payments on the notes will be blocked in the event of a payment default on certain senior indebtedness and may be blocked for up to of consecutive days in the event of certain nonpayment defaults on such debt 
after retiring our senior indebtedness  we may not have sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts due on any or all of the notes then outstanding 
the notes are exclusively obligations of mgi pharma  inc  are not guaranteed by any subsidiaries and will not be guaranteed by any of our future subsidiaries 
subsidiaries are and would be separate legal entities and would have no obligation to make any payments on the notes or to make any funds available for payment on the notes 
our right to receive assets of any such subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization and the consequent right of the holders of the notes to participate in those assets would be effectively subordinated to the claims of such subsidiaries creditors including trade creditors  except to the extent that we are reorganized as a creditor of such subsidiary  in which case our claims would still be subordinate to any security interests in the assets of such subsidiary and any indebtedness of such subsidiary senior to that held by us 
the indenture does not prohibit or limit us and would not limit any of our subsidiaries from incurring senior indebtedness or incurring other indebtedness and other liabilities 
as of december   we do not have senior indebtedness outstanding  and have no senior subordinated indebtedness other than the notes 
we anticipate that from time to time we will incur additional senior indebtedness and other additional liabilities 
there is no public market for the notes  which could limit their market price or the ability to sell them for their inherent value 
we cannot provide any assurances that a market will be available for the notes or that holders of our notes will be able to sell their notes 
if there is an available market  future trading prices of the notes will depend on many factors  including prevailing interest rates  the market for similar securities  general economic conditions and our financial condition  performance and prospects 
historically  the market for convertible debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial fluctuations in the prices of the securities 
accordingly  holders of our notes may be required to bear the financial risk of an investment in the notes for an indefinite period of time 
although the notes have been registered under the securities act  we have the right  pursuant to the registration rights agreement  to suspend the use of the shelf registration statement in certain circumstances 
in the event of such a suspension  note holders would not be able to sell the notes or associated common stock under the registration statement 
our convertible notes are not protected by restrictive covenants 
the indenture governing the notes does not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payment of dividends  the incurrence of indebtedness  the granting of security to other creditors  the movement of assets to subsidiaries which incur debt or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any subsidiaries that we may acquire in the future 
we may not have the ability to purchase notes at the option of the holders or upon a change in control or to raise the funds necessary to finance the purchases 
on march   march  and march   holders of the notes may require us to purchase their notes 
however  it is possible that we would not have sufficient funds at that time to make the required purchase of notes or would otherwise be prohibited under future debt instruments from making such payments in cash 
we may only pay the purchase price in cash and not in shares of our common stock 
in addition  upon the occurrence of certain specific kinds of change in control events  holders may require us to purchase for cash all or any portion of their notes 
however  it is possible that  upon a change in control  we may not have sufficient funds at that time to make the required purchase of notes  and we may be unable to raise the funds necessary 
the terms of future indebtedness we incur may restrict our ability to fund the purchase of notes upon a change in control or if we are otherwise required to purchase notes at the option of the holder 
if such restrictions exist  we would have to seek the consent of the lenders or repay those borrowings 
if we were unable to obtain the necessary consent or unable to repay those borrowings  we would be unable to purchase the notes and  as a result  would be in default under the notes 
the holders of our notes could receive less than the value of the shares of common stock into which the notes are convertible as a result of the conditional conversion feature of the notes 
the notes are convertible into shares of common stock only if specified conditions are met 
if the specified conditions for conversion are not met  holders of our notes will not be able to convert the notes  and may not be able to receive the value of the shares of common stock into which the notes would otherwise be convertible 
our charter documents  our stockholder rights plan and minnesota law contain provisions that could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company 
our charter documents contain provisions that may discourage third parties from seeking to acquire our company 
these provisions include advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations  and the authority of the board of directors to issue  without stockholder approval  preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine 
in addition  our board of directors has adopted a stockholder rights plan  or poison pill  which enables our board of directors to issue preferred stock purchase rights that would be triggered by an acquisition of percent or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
these provisions and specific provisions of minnesota law relating to business combinations with interested stockholders may have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a merger or change in control 
some of these provisions may discourage a future acquisition of our company even if stockholders would receive an attractive value for their shares or if a significant number of our stockholders believed such a proposed transaction to be in their best interests 
as a result  stockholders who desire to participate in such a transaction may not have the opportunity to do so 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our operations are not subject to risks of material foreign currency fluctuations  nor do we use derivative financial instruments in our investment practices 
we place our marketable investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
we do not expect material losses with respect to our investment portfolio or exposure to market risks associated with interest rates 
the impact on our net loss as a result of a one percentage point change in short term interest rates would be approximately million based on our cash  cash equivalents and unrestricted short term marketable investment balances at december
