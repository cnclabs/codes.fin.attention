table of contents part i item business ams health sciences  inc  or ams  began operations in  and through a corporate reorganization in  became an oklahoma corporation 
in this report the terms company  us  we  our and its are used as references to ams 
we develop and distribute performance based nutritional  weight loss and personal care products 
we distribute our products through a network marketing system using independent distributors that we refer to as associates 
network marketing appeals to a wide cross section of people  particularly those seeking to supplement income  start a home based business  or pursue entrepreneurial opportunities other than conventional full time employment 
we consider our attractive compensation plan and monthly cash bonus pools  along with trips  prizes and incentives  to be attractive components of the ams network marketing system 
our marketing plan is designed to provide associates financial incentives to build and manage a team of recruited associates in their downline organization 
on an ongoing basis  we review our product line for duplication and sales movement and make adjustments accordingly

our products are manufactured by various manufacturers pursuant to formulations developed for us and are sold to our independent associates located in all states  the district of columbia  puerto rico and canada 
we believe that our network marketing system is ideally suited to market nutritional  weight management and personal care products because sales of such products are strengthened by ongoing personal contact between associates and their customers

we supplement monetary incentives with other forms of recognition in order to further motivate and foster an atmosphere of excitement throughout our associate network 
key operating strengths our principal objective is to be a leading developer and distributor of weight loss products and performance based wellness systems 
our strategy to achieve this objective and maintain our position in the industry is to capitalize on our operating strengths  which includes the development and sale of performance based products  a strong product development capability  an attractive compensation plan for associates  and an experienced management team

our product development effort is based on the identification of next generation health discoveries  anticipation of consumer demand and the acquisition of completed and tested new product technology 
our management team continually 
table of contents investigates health  performance and industry trends for new natural extracts and formulated products  searches for formulations and ingredients that may be candidates for new products  identifies and compares existing and newly identified nutritional supplements  updates and improves existing products as new discoveries in nutrition are made  and prepares products to comply with regulatory requirements of international markets we enter 
manufacturing 
we outsource all manufacturing of our own products for the following reasons quality control is easier to monitor at established facilities  the market for quality services in the marketplace is competitive and attractive  and we believe our financial resources are better allocated to product development  marketing services and sales support 
attractive associate compensation plan and benefits 
we are committed to providing a highly competitive compensation plan to attract and retain associates  who constitute our sales force 
we believe the ams associate compensation plan is one of the most financially rewarding in the network marketing industry 
we pay daily incentives for recruiting new associates and weekly commissions for product sales 
the ams compensation plan is a consistent plan  meaning associates can recruit and receive compensation daily and weekly for their business in any market in which we conduct business 
to drive sales  plus provide product information and team management skills for associates  we sponsor events throughout the year which offer information about our products and the network marketing system

the current executive management team is responsible for developing an infrastructure to support rapid growth  strengthen our financial condition  and improve operational controls 
growth strategy we seek to grow our business by pursuing the following strategies new associate and preferred customer recruiting  training and development 
we recognize the need to aggressively grow our associate sales force  thereby building new sales 
in  we re launched the company to the industry after restructuring our marketing  sales and internet business strategies 
we focused on the development and distribution of performance based nutrition and weight loss products that will allow consumers to see and feel a difference in their health and well being  and will allow others to noticeably recognize similar differences within a short period of time 
we recognized the value that repositioning offered  backed by our exclusive core products am  prime one  prime one concentrate and toppfast 
on march   we announced the launch of our three phase mass marketing preferred customer acquisition program using a free trial format 
the three products  prime one  am fat burning solution and toppfast meal replacement shake  are packaged in two free trial programs and represent our core adaptogen and weight loss products  targeting consumer demand for increased energy  reduced belly fat and recognizable weight loss 
on may   we announced the signing of a product infomercial development agreement  representing the final phase of our customer acquisition program 

table of contents during  we added approximately  new sales associates and preferred customers with our free trial program 
this compares to additions of approximately  new sales associates for the prior year 
while retention rates from our free trial program appear to be equivalent with those associated with associate acquisition programs in past years  we will continue to monitor them until sufficient data is accumulated to substantiate our conclusion 
in september  we introduced our new energy and weight loss solution  am  a naturally sourced proprietary formula targeting energy anti fatigue and weight loss in one complete product 
this product also is included in our free trial program 
sales of am began september   and represent approximately  of our revenue 
also during  we launched our home party group  targeting the multibillion dollar home party market 
few  if any  companies have sold weight loss and energy products in this market 
the focus of this campaign is in home presentations to small groups of women  seeking to build a part time or full time business 
new market entry 
we believe that  in addition to the us and canadian markets  significant growth opportunities continue to exist in international markets 
we intend to select new markets following an assessment of several factors including market size  anticipated demand for ams products  receptivity to network marketing  and ease of entry  which includes consideration of possible regulatory restrictions on our products or network marketing system 
we will begin preparation for further international expansion as sales leadership develops 
we envision a seamlessly integrated associate compensation plan in each market that allows associates to receive commissions for global sales 
this seamless downline associate s sales organization  including the associate s recruits and their recruits structure would be designed to allow an associate to build a global network by creating downlines across national borders 
associates would not be required to establish new downlines or to re qualify for higher levels of compensation in newly opened markets 
we believe that going to a seamless compensation plan provides significant motivation and reward for associates to expand internationally by entering these new markets 
in august  we announced the opening of marketing and distribution in puerto rico  including the implementation of our free trial program 
sales to canada comprised approximately  of our net revenue 
new product introduction 
using our marketing demand and development capabilities  we will continue to introduce new products and continuously enhance existing products 
products introduced in include am  a naturally sourced  proprietary formula targeting energy anti fatigue and weight loss in one complete product 
our practice is to introduce new products  primarily at company sponsored events  based on demand 
strategic acquisitions 
we believe that attractive acquisition opportunities may arise in the future 
we intend to pursue strategic acquisition opportunities that would grow our customer base  expand product lines  enhance manufacturing and technical expertise  allow vertical integration  or otherwise complement our business or further our strategic goals 
on january   we purchased the lifescience technologies lst group of companies for million and a five year payment of  per month  or of the gross sales of lst products  whichever is greater 
as a result of this acquisition  we added products and over  associates 
we paid the balance of the acquisition note  plus accrued interest  in full on january  industry overview the nutrition industry includes many small and medium sized companies that manufacture and distribute products generally intended to maintain the body s health and general well being 
the four major product categories within the nutrition industry are as follows nutritional supplements products such as vitamins and minerals  sports performance enhancers  meal replacements  dietary supplements  herbs and botanicals  and compounds derived from these substances  
table of contents natural and organic foods products such as cereals  milk  non dairy beverages  and frozen entrees  functional foods products with added ingredients or fortification specifically for health or performance purposes  and natural personal care products combining nutrition with skin care 
we believe that the nutrition industry is being fueled by the following the public s exposure to more widely accepted natural and homeopathic alternatives  the desire to slow down the aging process  the national and worldwide trend toward preventive health care combining eastern and western medicine  and the rapid product introductions taking place in response to scientific research fueled by new demand 
nutritional products are distributed through six major sales channels 
each channel has changed in recent years  primarily due to advances in technology and communications  resulting in improved product distribution and faster dissemination of information 
the major sales channels are as follows ams associates participate in four of the six channels listed below mass market retailers  including mass merchandisers  drug stores  supermarkets and discount stores  natural health food retailers  network marketing  mail order  healthcare professionals and practitioners  and the internet 
products our primary product lines include nutritional  weight management and personal care 
we currently market approximately seventy products  exclusive of variations in product size  colors or similar variations of our basic product line 
nutritional 
this product line includes antioxidants  minerals  vitamins  and other nutritional supplements 
the nutritional supplement products are designed to provide optimal absorption  bioavailability  and efficacy 
during the years ended december   and   and of our net sales were derived from the products in the nutritional category  which contain herbs  vitamins  minerals and other natural ingredients 
the top selling products in this category are prime one  prime one concentrate and spark of life liquid nutritional which totaled approximately  and  respectively  of net sales in weight management 
this product line was developed to provide a comprehensive approach to weight management including the am family of weight loss supplements  along with weight loss 
table of contents systems 
during the years ended december   and  the weight management category represented  and of our net sales 
sales were derived from the six products in the weight management category that we market under the ams health sciences label 
personal care 
this product line includes scientifically developed natural products designed to support healthy skin and hair 
products in this line include those from the chambre international line and products acquired from dr 
robert nakamura and immudyne inc the three product wrinkle and facial line reducing system is called nino sorgente skin care and includes eye serum  facial serum and daily moisturizer 
during the years ended december   and   and of our net sales were derived from the products in the personal care category 
promotional materials 
in addition to these three principal product lines  we have developed and sell to associates materials and online tools designed to assist them in building their business and selling products 
these sales aids are generally written and produced by ams and include product audio tapes  cd rom s  video tapes  brochures and business forms designed by us and printed by outside publishers 
we periodically contract with authors and publishers to produce or provide books  tapes  and other items dealing with health topics and personal motivation  which are made available to associates 
new associates are required to purchase an enrollment packet containing training materials that assist in beginning and growing a business 
associates do not earn commissions on the sale of sales aids or enrollment packets 
other products and services 
prior to focusing on nutritional  weight management and personal care products in october  we marketed various packages of consumer benefit services provided by third party providers 
the only remaining benefit service we offer is a pre paid legal service 
the pre paid legal services are provided by pre paid legal services  inc this program membership represented less than of our net sales during  and new product identification 
we are committed to continuous product innovation and improvement through market demand and products backed by science 
the mission of our science and product development is to develop  for target groups  advanced wellness products that deliver performance based results around our core peak performance and weight loss focus 
that is  products that deliver noticeable results  slow the aging process  reduce the risk of chronic illness  and promote long term health 
new product ideas and research efforts are supported using a combination of our advisory talent and research  third party studies and sponsored research 
we intend to dedicate resources for the science and development of new products and reformulation of existing products 
prior to introducing new products  we investigate product formulation as it relates to regulatory compliance and other issues 
for products on which we acquire the distribution or ownership rights  we maintain and access any and all science and research related to those products 
for example  the acquisition of prime one brought over years of research and thousands of trials and studies on the prime one products and ingredients 
the distribution rights for immudyne s sorgente skin care system brought the use of patents  studies and documentation for use in our marketing effort 
we maintain an advisory relationship with dr 
robert nakamura  and also rely upon the product development staff of chemins company  inc and other manufacturers  independent researchers  vendor research departments and others for such services 
when a new product concept is identified or when an existing product must be reformulated  the new product concept or reformulation project is generally submitted to chemins for technical development and implementation 
we continually review our existing products for potential enhancements to improve their effectiveness and marketability 
while we consider our product formulations to be proprietary trade secrets  such formulations are not patented 
accordingly  there is no assurance that another company will not replicate one or more of our products 
product procurement and distribution  insurance 
essentially all of our product line in the weight management category is manufactured by chemins company  inc utilizing our product formulations 

table of contents naturtech manufactures our nutritional product line  and essentially all of our product line in the personal care category is manufactured by gdmi  inc and columbia cosmetics  inc all our vendors have assured us that they conduct quality control processes  and laboratory analysts test for biological contamination of raw materials and finished goods 
in the analytical chemistry laboratory  analysts test for chemical contamination and accurate active ingredient levels of raw materials and finished products 
both laboratories conduct stability tests on finished products to determine product shelf life 
we have not generally entered into long term supply agreements with the manufacturers of our product line or the third party providers of our consumer benefit services 
however  we customarily enter into contracts with our manufacturers and suppliers to establish the terms and conditions of purchases 
our arrangements with chemins company  inc may be terminated by either party upon the completion of any outstanding purchase orders 
therefore  there can be no assurance that chemins will continue to manufacture our products or provide research  development and formulation services 
in the event the relationship with any of our manufacturers becomes impaired  we will be required to obtain alternative manufacturing sources for our products 
in such event  there is no assurance that the manufacturing processes of our current manufacturers can be replicated by another manufacturer 
although we have not previously experienced product unavailability or supply interruptions  we believe that we would be able to obtain alternative sources for our nutritional  weight management and personal care products 
a significant delay or reduction in availability of products  however  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
most of the raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are available from a number of suppliers 
we have not generally experienced difficulty in obtaining necessary quantities of raw materials 
when supplies of certain raw materials have tightened  we have been able to find alternative sources as needed  and believe we will be able to do so in the future if the need arises 
we  like other marketers of products that are intended to be ingested  face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in injury 
we maintain a claims made policy  with limited product liability insurance with coverage limits of  per occurrence and  in the aggregate 
products containing ephedra  which represented and of our and net sales  respectively  are not covered by our product liability insurance 
although we do not obtain contractual indemnification  our product manufacturers carry product liability insurance that covers our products 
product liability claims in excess of insurance coverage may result in significant losses  which would adversely affect product sales  results of our operations  financial condition and the value of our common stock 
all of the items in our product line include a customer satisfaction guarantee 
within days of purchase  any retail customer or associate who is not satisfied with our product for any reason may return it or any unused portion to the associate from whom it was purchased or to us for a full refund or credit toward the purchase of another product 
associates may obtain replacements from us for products returned to them by retail customers if they return such products on a timely basis 
furthermore  in most jurisdictions  we maintain a buy back program 
under this program  we will repurchase products sold to an associate  subject to a restocking charge  provided the associate resigns and returns the product in marketable condition within months of original purchase  or longer where required by applicable state law or regulations 
we believe this buy back program addresses a number of the regulatory compliance issues pertaining to network marketing systems 
for the years ended december   and  the cost of products returned to us was  and of gross sales 
the increase in returns was due to the cancellation of first autoshipments under our free trial program 
our product line is distributed principally from our facilities in oklahoma city or from our regional support centers 
products are warehoused in oklahoma city and at selected regional support centers 
network marketing we market and distribute our products through a network marketing system and sell directly to associates and preferred customers 
at december   we had approximately  active associates 
to be considered active an associate must have purchased in products or on autoship of our products 
table of contents within the preceding days 
network marketing is a form of person to person direct selling through a network of vertically organized independent distributors who purchase products at wholesale prices from the manufacturer for resale to retail consumers 
the emergence of readily available means of mass communication such as personal computers  facsimiles  low cost long distance telephone services  and the internet has contributed to the rapid growth of network marketing 
the concept of network marketing is based on the strength of personal recommendations that frequently come from friends  neighbors  relatives  and close acquaintances 
we believe that network marketing is an effective way to distribute our products because it allows person to person product education  which is not as readily available through other distribution channels 
we believe our network marketing system appeals to a broad cross section of people  particularly those seeking to supplement family income  start a home business  or pursue employment opportunities other than conventional  full time employment 
a majority of our associates therefore sell our products on a part time basis 
we believe that our network marketing system is ideally suited to market our product line because sales of such products are strengthened by ongoing personal contact between retail consumers and associates  many of whom use our products themselves 
sales are made through direct personal sales presentations as well as presentations made to groups in a format known as opportunity meetings 
these sales methods are designed to encourage individuals to purchase our products by informing potential customers and associates of our product line and results of personal use  and the potential financial benefits of becoming an associate 
the objective of the marketing program is to develop a broad based network marketing organization within a relatively short period 
our marketing efforts are typically focused on middle income families and individuals 
our network marketing program encourages individuals to develop their own downline network marketing organizations 
each new associate is either linked to the existing associate that personally enrolled the new associate into our network marketing organization  or the existing associate in the enrolling associate s downline as specified at the time of enrollment 
growth of an associate s downline organization is dependent upon the recruiting and enrollment of additional associates within such associate s downline organization 
associates are encouraged to assume responsibility for training and motivation of others within their downline organization and to conduct opportunity meetings as soon as they are appropriately trained 
we strive to maintain a high level of motivation  morale  enthusiasm and integrity among the members of our network marketing organization 
we believe this result is achieved through a combination of products  sales incentives  personal recognition of outstanding achievement and quality promotional materials 
under our network marketing program  associates purchase sales aids and brochures from us and assume the costs of advertising and marketing our product line to their customers as well as the direct cost of recruiting new associates 
we believe that this form of sales organization is cost efficient because our direct sales expenses are primarily limited to the payment of bonuses  which are only incurred when products are sold 
we continually strive to improve our marketing strategies  including the compensation structure within our network marketing organization and the variety and mix of products in our line  to attract and motivate associates 
these efforts are designed to increase monthly product sales and the recruiting of new associates 
to aid associates in easily meeting the monthly personal product purchase requirement to qualify for bonuses  we developed the autoship in under the autoship purchasing arrangement  associates establish a standing product order for an amount in excess of that is automatically charged to their credit card or 
table of contents deducted from their bank account for goods shipped that month 
at december   and  we had approximately   and  associates participating in the autoship 
our bonus structure provides for payment of bonuses on product purchases made by other associates in an associate s downline organization 
associates derive income from several sources first  associates earn profits by purchasing from our product line at wholesale prices which are discounted up to from suggested retail prices and selling to customers at retail  second  associates earn profits from the products sold in the sign up of new associates from our enroller bonuses and lucrative coding bonuses  which are tied to the downline organization  third  associates who establish their own downline organization may earn bonuses of up to of bonus value on product purchases by associates within the first four levels of their downline organization  fourth  associates who have per month of product purchases on their first and second levels combined  become directors and have the opportunity to build an additional director downline organization and receive additional bonuses of of bonus value on product purchases by such downline organization  fifth  associates who have  per month of product purchases on their first and second levels combined  two director legs and  wholesale volume monthly in their downline  become silver directors and have the opportunity to build an additional silver director downline organization and receive additional bonuses of of bonus value on product purchases by such downline organization  sixth  associates who have  per month of product purchases on their first level and second levels combined  two silver legs and have a total of  wholesale volume monthly in their downline  become gold directors and have the opportunity to receive an additional bonus of of bonus value on product purchases by their silver director downline organization 
in addition  gold directors have the opportunity to receive generation bonuses of up to of bonus value on the product purchases by associates of silver director downline organizations that originate from their silver director downline organization through four generations  and seventh  associates who maintain the gold director requirements and develop three gold directors  each one from a separate leg of their downline organization plus  wholesale volume in downline organization  become platinum directors and have the opportunity to build an additional platinum director downline organization and receive additional bonuses of of bonus value on product purchases by such downline organization 
combining these levels of bonuses  our total pay out on products subject to bonuses is approximately of the bonus value of product sales  and of total sales 
each associate in our network marketing organization has a director  a silver director  a gold director and a platinum director 
each director has a silver director  a gold director and a platinum director 
each silver director has a gold director and a platinum director 
each gold director has a platinum director 
as of december   we had silver directors  gold directors and platinum directors 
under our regional support center program  we designate associates to serve as regional support center directors and provide them special training and support 
each regional support center director functions as a product distribution center for our products 
as of december   we had regional support center directors 
we maintain a computerized system for processing associate orders and calculating bonus payments which enable us to remit such payments promptly 
we believe that prompt and accurate remittance of bonuses is vital to recruiting and maintaining associates  as well as increasing their motivation and loyalty to us 
we make 
table of contents weekly bonus payments based upon the previous week s product purchases  while most network marketing companies only make monthly bonus payments 
during  and  we paid bonuses to   and  associates  in the aggregate amounts of   and  respectively 
we are committed to providing the best possible support to our associates 
associates in our network marketing organization are provided training guides and are given the opportunity to participate in our training programs 
we sponsor regularly scheduled conference calls for our platinum directors which include testimonials from successful associates and satisfied customers  as well as current product and promotional information 
we produce a monthly newsletter which provides information on our products and network marketing system 
the newsletter is designed to help recruit new associates by answering commonly asked questions and includes product information and business building information 
the newsletter also provides a forum for additional recognition of associates for outstanding performance 
in addition  we regularly sponsor training sessions for our associates across the united states 
at these training sessions  associates are provided the opportunity to learn more about our product line and selling techniques  so they can build their businesses more rapidly 
we produce comprehensive and attractive four color catalogues and brochures that display and describe our product line 
we maintain a web page at www 
amsonline 
com  which provides general company information along with product line and network marketing system information 
from time to time  associates fail to adhere to the ams policies and procedures  including those governing the marketing of our products or representations regarding the compensation plan 
we systematically review reports of alleged associate misbehavior 
infractions of the policies and procedures are reported to a compliance committee that determines what disciplinary action may be warranted in each case 
if we determine that an associate has violated any of the ams policies and procedures  we may take a number of disciplinary actions 
for example  we may terminate the associate s purchase and distribution rights completely  or impose sanctions such as warnings  fines  or probation 
we may also withdraw or deny awards  suspend privileges  withhold commissions until specific conditions are satisfied  or take other appropriate actions at our discretion 
an in house compliance department also routinely reviews associate activities 
we believe that the ability to efficiently manage distribution  compensation  manufacturing  inventory control and communications functions through the use of sophisticated and dependable information processing systems is critical to our success 
to optimally support our customer base and core business processes  our information technology resources consist of a customized  web enabled order entry system and an integrated system to manage inventory  production planning  fulfillment and financial information 
our information systems are maintained by in house staff and outside consultants 
these systems are designed to provide  among other things  financial and operating data for management  timely and accurate product ordering  bonus payment processing  inventory management and detailed associate records 
since  we have invested more than million to enhance our computer and telecommunications systems 
regulation in the united states  as well as in any foreign markets in which we may sell our products  we are subject to laws  regulations  administrative determinations  court decisions and similar restrictions at the federal  state and local levels  collectively known as regulations 
these regulations include and pertain to  among other things the formulation  manufacturing  packaging  labeling  advertising  distribution  importation  sale and storage of our products  our product claims and advertising  including label claims  direct claims and advertising  as well as claims and advertising by associates  for which we may be held responsible  and our network marketing organization and activities 

table of contents products 
the formulation  manufacturing  packaging  labeling  advertising  distribution and sale and storage of our products are subject to regulation by a number of governmental agencies 
the federal agencies include the food and drug administration  or fda  the federal trade commission  or ftc  the consumer product safety commission  the united states department of agriculture and the environmental protection agency 
our activities are also regulated by various codes and agencies of the states  localities and foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured  distributed or sold 
the fda  in particular  regulates the formulation  manufacturing and labeling of dietary supplements  cosmetics and skin care products  including many of our products 
the dietary supplement health and education act of  or dshea  revised the provisions of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  or ffdca  concerning the composition and labeling of dietary supplements  which we believe is generally favorable to the dietary supplement industry 
dshea created a new statutory category of products  or dietary supplements 
this new category includes vitamins  minerals  herbs  amino acids  and other dietary substances for human use to supplement the diet 
however  dshea grandfathered  with certain limitations  dietary ingredients that were on the market before october  a dietary supplement containing a new dietary ingredient  or ndi  and placed on the market on or after october   must have a history of use or other evidence establishing a basis for expected safety 
manufacturers of dietary supplements using a structure function statement or claim must have scientific substantiation that the statement is truthful  accurate  and not misleading 
the majority of our sales come from products that are classified as dietary supplements under the ffdca and dshea 
the labeling requirements for dietary supplements  with respect to labels affixed to containers  have been set forth in final regulations  effective march  these regulations include how to include the serving size  declare dietary ingredient information  and the proper detail and format required for the supplement facts box 
during  we revised our product labels to be in compliance with those regulations 
many states have also recently become active in the regulation of dietary supplement products 
these states may require modification of labeling or formulation of certain of our products sold in these states  eg texas  new york  and california 
finally  in recent years california courts have grown increasingly active in consumer protection and private attorney general lawsuits  some of which have targeted certain herbal supplement ingredients  such as kava kava or ginseng 
these suits have not directly affected our products or sales  but we continue to be aware of california s business and professional code especially as to advertising of products  and litigation in california  particularly regarding proposition or prop  which disallows many ingredients in products sold in that state 
on january   the fda published a final rule on permissible structure function statements to be placed on labels and in brochures 
structure function statements are claims of the benefit or positive effect of a product or an ingredient on the body s structure or function 
this regulation does not significantly change the way that the fda interprets structure function statements 
thus  we did not make any substantial label revisions based on this regulation regarding any of our structure function product statements 
then on november   the fda published a notice in the federal register that the level of science needed to support a structure function claim would be raised close to the current ftc standard  which is competent and reliable scientific evidence 
we believe that ams has adequate substantiation for all label claims used 
ephedra 
as a marketer of products that are ingested by consumers  we are subject to the risk that one or more of the ingredients in our products may become the subject of adverse regulatory action 
for example  one of the ingredients in our prior am product was ephedra  an herb that contains naturally occurring ephedrine alkaloids 
our manufacturer used a powdered extract of that herb when manufacturing am we marketed am principally as an aid in weight management 
the extract was an extract  which means that every milligrams of the powdered extract contains approximately eight milligrams of naturally occurring ephedrine alkaloids 
on february   the fda issued and published in the federal register its final rule on ephedrine containing supplements  stating that since an unreasonable risk had been determined  such supplements would be considered adulterated under the ffdca  and thus may not be sold 
in essence  this final rule or regulation imposes a national ban on ephedrine supplements 

table of contents the effective date of this regulation was april  we complied with the new regulation and ceased all sales and advertisement of am and any other ephedra containing supplement as of april  for the future  the fda and also congress have indicated that they will consider whether alternatives to ephedra  other weight loss and energy stimulants such as bitter orange  similarly carry an unreasonable risk 
these proposals to limit stimulant ingredients  if finalized  may necessitate reformulations of some of our weight loss products 
also  in the aftermath of the ephedra ban  on april   in comments before a scientific meeting  then acting fda commissioner  lester crawford now the nominee for commissioner  outlined what an fda press release termed a science based plan for dietary supplement enforcement 
the press release went on to say that the agency would soon provide further details about its plan to ensure that the consumer protection provisions of dshea are used effectively and appropriately 
referring to its recent rulemaking on ephedra  the fda also stated that it expects to evaluate the available pharmacology  published literature  evidence based reviews  and adverse event information of individual dietary supplements 
soon afterwards  this promised fda document was issued  with the title regulatory strategy for the further implementation and enforcement of the dietary supplement health and education act of 
no new regulations or proposed rules pursuant to this strategy have yet been issued  except that the fda has recently welcomed and received comments from the industry for a better procedure for the fda to review a company s safety information as to a new dietary ingredient  or ndi  in an ndi notification 
at this time  ndi notifications are not required for any ams products 
anti dshea proposed legislation 
finally  as the press  the fda  and members of congress and of the supplement industry have all predicted  the very issuance of the final rule on ephedra has caused congress to rethink dshea  specifically as to how safety in supplements may be ensured  and also as to whether specific categories of dietary ingredients should not be permitted at all 
in particular  there is growing sentiment including from one herbal trade association to make adverse event reporting aers mandatory for all manufacturers and marketers of dietary supplements  so that the fda may take action more quickly than it did on ephedra  when a harmful herb or other ingredient is suspected 
since february  there have been several bills proposed in congress that would amend dshea  make safety safeguards stricter  even approaching the rigor and reporting required for fda regulated drugs 
some examples are as follows s 
the dietary supplement safety act was introduced by senator richard durbin in march  and would greatly undermine dshea  especially section regarding safety  giving the fda new powers of oversight and blanket authority over whole categories of supplements  including stimulants 
stimulants are used in many weight loss products  including some of our supplements 
to the best of our knowledge  this bill and the bill described below though perhaps under different numbers are still pending 
hr beginning on october   senator mccain chaired senate hearings on whether dshea adequately protects consumers 
also on october  cong 
susan davis and cong 
henry waxman introduced the dietary supplement access and awareness act  hr  purporting to be about safety and access for consumers to supplements  but actually recommending severe restrictions and dramatic redefinitions of what constitutes a dietary supplement 
this bill would impose several requirements for supplements  including unprecedented fda pre approval as well as strict aer reporting  and excludes only vitamins and minerals from such new requirements 
like s 
 this bill would reverse the safety burden of proof in section of dshea one of the industry s victories in  and instead require the manufacturer to demonstrate safety  rather than the burden being on the fda to show imminent hazard or unreasonable risk 
with the help of our regulatory attorney  we will continue to monitor these anti dshea bills  and determine if any of them become a serious threat to our business 
in addition  the two major trade associations of the dietary supplement industry the american herbal products association  or ahpa  and the national natural foods association  or nnfa have both been actively lobbying against any bills that would require or lead to unreasonable restraints on the manufacture and marketing of dietary supplements 

table of contents manufacturing 
pursuant to current law  dietary supplements are manufactured using food gmps  which stands for good manufacturing practices 
dshea empowered the fda to issue specialized gmps for dietary supplements  but several years passed before the fda took the next step in the rule making process 
on march   the fda published a proposed rule in the federal register which proposes comprehensive gmps 
the fda accepted public comments on the proposed gmps until june   final gmps for supplements will be promulgated after the fda has reviewed the public comments 
once final gmp regulations become effective  our manufacturer will be required to adhere to them 
the fda will most likely institute an effective date for the gmps which will allow our manufacturer a reasonable amount of time to conduct this review and  if necessary  revise its manufacturing operations to comply with the final gmp regulations 
typically  the effective date for new manufacturing and labeling regulations is months after the promulgation of the final rule or new regulation 
as of march   the fda had not yet published this final rule on gmps 
advertising and website 
the fda considers website promotional content to constitute labeling  and thus the ams website must not contain disease claims or drug claims  but only permissible structure function claims 
the ftc governs the advertising of dietary supplements  in any medium or vehicle print ads  radio spots  infomercials  etc 
including internet ads and websites 
the fundamental ftc rule is that all material advertising claims  whether express direct or implied  must be substantiated by reliable and competent scientific evidence 
because our website must comply with both fda and ftc regulations  we routinely ask our regulatory compliance counsel to review certain web pages  especially the content of new product promotions 
when necessary  our regulatory counsel also reviews the scientific substantiation for particular claims again  especially for new products such as prime one  an anti stress and weight loss product to determine if it is sufficient  and also that there are no disease claims present  the main fda issue 
ams also requires associate websites to be in compliance with fda and ftc regulations 
as such  and to ensure internet compliance  associates may only copy or link to our corporate website 
any independent websites are absolutely unauthorized  and their creators are solely liable for defending any regulatory enforcement actions 
violation of this policy may result in termination by ams 
this policy was explicitly conveyed to all associates via a formal letter notice  prepared by our chief financial officer cfo and our regulatory counsel  and signed by our cfo 
in markets outside the united states  prior to commencing operations or marketing products  we may be required to obtain approvals  licenses  or certifications from a country s ministry of health or comparable agency 
approvals or licensing may be conditioned on reformulation of ams products for the market or may be unavailable with respect to certain products or product ingredients 
we must also comply with local product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from country to country 
foreign regulatory requirements have not placed a significant burden on our ability to operate in current foreign countries 
product claims and advertising 
advertising of products is subject to regulation by the ftc under the ftc act 
section of the ftc act prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce 
section of the ftc act provides that the dissemination of  or causing to be disseminated  any false advertisement pertaining to drugs or foods  which would include dietary supplements  is an unfair or deceptive act or practice 
under the ftc s substantiation doctrine  an advertiser is required to have a reasonable basis for all objective product claims before the claims are made 
failure to adequately substantiate claims may be considered either deceptive or unfair practices 
pursuant to this ftc requirement  we are required to have adequate substantiation for all material advertising claims made for our products 
in recent years  the ftc has initiated numerous investigations of and actions against dietary supplement  weight management  and cosmetic products and companies 
the ftc issued a guidance document in november  but still current to assist companies in understanding and complying with the substantiation requirement for advertising claims for supplements 
we have organized the documentation supporting and substantiating our advertising and promotional practices in compliance with these guidelines 
our director of marketing works closely with our regulatory counsel to assure the proper 
table of contents level of substantiation of all advertising claims  regardless of vehicle or medium  eg  tv commercial  website  or testimonial  etc 
in particular  last year the ftc has been especially active  using its overlapping jurisdiction with the fda and its joint agency enforcement mechanism called cyber stings via the ftc s monitoring of supplement claims found on internet advertising  a relentless program termed operation cure all 
when the ftc finds compliance violations  the fda then sends out warning letters regarding these internet claims  called cyber letters 
in particular  as to diet products  the ftc several months ago issued specific new guidelines for permissible weight loss claims  prohibiting claims that the commission considers to be infeasible  or unable to be supported by current science 
our regulatory counsel keeps us fully apprised of all such new guidelines and regulations  via compliance updates sent twice per month 
in an action that may be pertinent to us  the ftc has recently objected to some weight loss claims involving stress and the hormone cortisol  including an enforcement action against the formulator and marketers of cortislim 
we are watching such enforcement actions closely  to determine the ftc s parameters regarding such stress and weight claims  which would affect some of our newer products 
the ftc may enforce compliance with the law in a variety of ways  both administratively and judicially  using compulsory process  cease and desist orders  and injunctions 
ftc enforcement can result in orders requiring  among other things  limits on advertising  corrective advertising  disgorgement of profits  consumer redress  divestiture of assets  rescission of contracts  and such other relief as the agency deems necessary to protect the public 
violation of these orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties 
we have not been notified that we have been  or are the subject of  any enforcement action by the ftc  but such action in the future by the ftc could materially adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products 
that is why we pay careful attention to new guidelines and recent investigations launched  complaints filed  and fines imposed by the ftc  as shown above 
compliance efforts 
we attempt to remain in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations governing the manufacture  labeling  sale  distribution and advertising of our dietary supplements 
we retain special legal counsel for advice on both fda and ftc legal issues 
in particular  we work closely with special legal counsel who specializes in dshea regulations for label revisions  content of structure function statements  advertising copy  and also the position of the fda on ephedra containing products 
network marketing system 
laws and regulations in each country in which we operate prevent the use of deceptive or fraudulent practices that have sometimes been inappropriately associated with legitimate direct selling and network marketing activities 
these laws include anti pyramiding  securities  lottery  referral selling  anti fraud and business opportunity statutes  regulations and court cases 
illegal schemes  typically referred to as pyramid  chain distribution  or endless chain schemes  compensate participants primarily or solely for the introduction or enrollment of additional participants into the scheme 
often these schemes are characterized by large up front entry or sign up fees  over priced products of low value  little or no emphasis on the sale or use of products  high pressure recruiting tactics  and claims of huge and quick financial rewards requiring little or no effort 
generally these laws are directed at ensuring that product sales ultimately are made to consumers and that advancement within sales organizations is based on sales of the enterprise s products  rather than investments in the organizations or other non retail sales related criteria or activity 
where required by law  we obtain regulatory approval of our network marketing system  or  where approval is not required or available  the favorable opinion of local counsel as to regulatory compliance 
we currently have independent associates in all states  the district of columbia  puerto rico and canada 
in addition to federal regulation in the united states  each state has enacted its own little ftc act to regulate sales and advertising 
occasionally  we receive requests to supply information regarding our network marketing plan to regulatory agencies 
although we have from time to time modified our network marketing system to comply with interpretations of various regulatory authorities  we believe that our network marketing program is in compliance with laws and regulations relating to network marketing activities in our current markets 
nevertheless  we remain subject to the risk that  in one or more of our present or future markets  the marketing system or the conduct of certain associates could be found not to be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
failure by an associate or us to comply with these laws 
table of contents and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business in a particular market or in general 
any or all of these factors could adversely affect the way we do business and could affect our ability to attract potential associates or enter new markets 
in the united states  the ftc has been active in its enforcement efforts against both pyramid schemes and legitimate network marketing organizations with certain legally problematic components  having instituted several enforcement actions resulting in signed settlement agreements and payment of large fines 
although to our knowledge  we have not been the target of an ftc investigation  there can be no assurance that the ftc will not investigate us in the future 
noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in enforcement action and imposition of penalties  require modification of our network marketing system  result in negative publicity  or have a negative effect on associate morale and loyalty 
any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our sales as well as our financial condition 
we cannot predict the nature of any future law  regulation  interpretation  or application  nor can we predict what effect additional governmental legislation or regulations  judicial decisions  or administrative orders  when and if promulgated  would have on our business in the future 
it is possible that future developments may require that we revise our network marketing program 
any or all of these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
we are subject to the risk of challenges to the legality of our network marketing system by our associates  both individually and as a class 
generally such challenges would be based on claims that our network marketing system was operated as an illegal pyramid scheme in violation of federal and state securities laws  state unfair practice and fraud laws and the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act 
two important federal trade commission cases have established legal precedent for determining whether a network marketing system constitutes an illegal pyramid scheme 
the first  in re koscot interplanetary  inc  ftc  set forth a standard for determining whether a marketing system constituted a pyramid scheme 
under the koscot standard  a pyramid scheme is characterized by the participants payment of money to a company in return for the right to sell a product  and the right to receive  in return for recruiting other participants into the program  rewards that are unrelated to sales of the product to ultimate users 
applying the koscot standard in in re amway corp  ftc  the ftc determined that a company will not be classified as operating a pyramid scheme if the company adopts and enforces policies that in fact encourage retail sales to consumers and prevent inventory loading 
inventory loading occurs when associates purchase large quantities of non returnable inventory to obtain the full amount of compensation available under the system 
in amway  the ftc found that the marketing system of amway corporation did not constitute a pyramid scheme  noting the following amway policies participants were required to buy back  from any person they recruited  any salable  unsold inventory upon the recruit leaving amway  every participant was required to sell at wholesale or retail at least of the products bought in a given month in order to receive a bonus for that month  and 
table of contents in order to receive a bonus in a month  each participant was required to submit proof of retail sales made to different consumers 
we believe that our network marketing system is not classified as a pyramid scheme under the standards set forth in koscot  amway  and other applicable law 
in particular  in most jurisdictions  we maintain an inventory buy back program to address the problem of inventory loading 
pursuant to this program  we repurchase products sold to an associate subject to a restocking charge provided that the associate resigns  and returns the product in marketable condition within months of original purchase  or longer where required by applicable state law or regulations 
our literature provided to associates describes our buy back program 
in addition  pursuant to agreements with our associates  each associate represents that at least of the products he or she buys will be sold to non associates 
however  as is the case with other network marketing companies  the bonuses paid by us to our associates are based on product purchases including purchases of products that are personally consumed by the downline associates 
basing bonuses on sales of personally consumed products may be considered an inventory loading purchase 
furthermore  associates bonuses are based on the wholesale prices received by us on product purchases or  in some cases based upon the particular product purchased  on prices less than the wholesale prices 
in the event of challenges to the legality of our network marketing system by associates  we would be required to demonstrate that our network marketing policies are enforced  and that the network marketing system and associates compensation thereunder serve as safeguards to deter inventory loading and encourage retail sales to the ultimate consumers 
in webster v 
omnitrition international  inc  f 
d th cir 
 the united states court of appeals held that a class action brought against omnitrition international  inc  a multilevel marketing seller of nutritional supplements and skin care products  should be allowed to proceed to trial 
the plaintiffs  former associates of omnitrition s products  alleged that omnitrition s selling program was an illegal pyramid scheme and claimed violations of racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act and several federal and state fraud and securities laws 
despite evidence that omnitrition complied with the amway standards  the court ruled that a jury would have to decide whether omnitrition s policies  many of which apparently were similar to compliance policies adopted by us  were adequate to ensure that omnitrition s marketing efforts resulted in a legitimate product marketing and distribution structure and not an illegal pyramid scheme 
we believe that our marketing and sales programs differ in significant respects from those of omnitrition  and that our marketing program complies with applicable law 
the two most significant differences are the omnitrition marketing plan required associates to purchase  in merchandise in order to qualify for bonuses as compared to on autoship under our marketing program  and the omnitrition inventory repurchase policy was limited to products that were less than three months old as compared to one year under our inventory repurchase policy 
lessons from the omnitrition case are that a selling program which operates to generate only the minimum purchases necessary to qualify for bonuses is suspect  and a selling program must operate to generate purchases independently of the payment of bonuses in order to have a legitimate product marketing and distribution structure 

table of contents we believe that our selling program operates to generate significant purchases for intrinsic value as demonstrated by our sales figures 
during the month of december   of our associates placed a total of  orders averaging in size  while only a single on autoship per month is necessary to qualify for bonuses 
in view of the holding of the court of appeals in the omnitrition case  however  there is no assurance that  if challenged  we would prevail against private plaintiffs alleging violations of anti pyramid and securities laws 
a final ruling against us in such a suit could result in the imposition of a material liability against us 
moreover  even if we were successful in defending against such suit  the costs of such defense  both in dollars spent and in management time  could be material and adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  the negative publicity of such a suit could adversely affect our sales and ability to attract and retain associates 
nutrition for life international  inc  one of our competitors and a multilevel seller of personal care and nutritional supplements  announced in january that it had settled class action litigation brought by associates alleging fraud in connection with the operation of a pyramid scheme 
nutrition for life paid in excess of million to settle claims brought on behalf of its associates  and related securities fraud claims brought on behalf of certain purchasers of its stock 
we believe that our marketing program is significantly different from the program allegedly promoted by nutrition for life and that our marketing program is not in violation of anti pyramid laws or regulations 
two issues in the nutrition for life matter were a  buy in urged on new recruits  and the paying of commissions on product vouchers prior to the actual delivery of product 
by design  our marketing program offers no incentive to anyone to make a large personal purchase  nor do we use product vouchers 
actual average order size in december was as stated before  there is no assurance that claims similar to the claims brought against nutrition for life and other multilevel marketing organizations will not be brought against us  or that we will prevail in the event any such claims were made 
intellectual property trademarks 
we have developed and use registered trademarks in our business  particularly relating to the corporate and product names 
we use several trademarks and trade names in connection with our products and operations 
as of december   we had federal trademark registrations with the united states patent and trademark office 
federal registration of a trademark enables the registered owner of the mark to bar the unauthorized use of the registered mark in connection with a similar product in the same channels of trade by any third party anywhere in the united states  regardless of whether the registered owner has ever used the trademark in the area where the unauthorized use occurs 
we have filed applications and own trademark registrations  and we intend to register additional trademarks in foreign countries where ams products are or may be sold in the future 
protection afforded registered trademarks in some jurisdictions may not be as extensive as the protection available in the united states 
we also claim ownership and protection of certain product names  unregistered trademarks  and service marks under common law 
common law trademark rights do not provide the same level of protection afforded by registration of a trademark 
in addition  common law trademark rights are limited to the geographic area in which the trademark is actually used 
we believe these trademarks  whether registered or claimed under common law  constitute valuable assets  adding to recognition of ams and the marketing of ams products 
we therefore believe that these proprietary rights have been  and will continue to be  important in enabling us to compete 
trade secrets 
we own certain intellectual property  including trade secrets  which we seek to protect  in part  through confidentiality agreements with employees and other parties  although some employees involved in research and development activities have not entered into these agreements 
even where these agreements exist  there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that we would have adequate remedies for any breach  or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to  or independently developed by  competitors 
our proprietary product formulations are generally considered trade secrets  but are not otherwise protected under intellectual property laws 

table of contents competition the business of developing and distributing nutritional  personal care  and weight management products such as those we sell and distribute is highly competitive 
numerous manufacturers  distributors  and retailers compete for consumers and  in the case of other network marketing companies  for associates 
we compete directly with other entities that develop  manufacture  market  and distribute products in each of our product lines 
we compete with these entities by emphasizing the underlying science  value  and high quality of our products as well as the convenience and financial benefits afforded by our network marketing system and compensation plan 
however  many of our competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial resources and broader name recognition 
our markets are highly sensitive to the introduction of new products that may rapidly capture a significant share of those markets 
the nutritional supplement market is characterized by large selections of essentially similar products that are difficult to differentiate  retail consumer emphasis on value pricing  constantly changing formulations based on evolving scientific research  low entry barriers resulting from low brand loyalty  rapid change  widely available manufacturing  low regulatory requirements  and ready access to large distribution channels  and a lack of uniform standards regarding product ingredient sources  potency  purity  absorption rate  and form 
similar factors are also characteristic of products comprising our other product lines 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively compete in this intensely competitive environment 
in addition  nutritional  personal care  and weight management products can be purchased in a wide variety of channels of distribution  including retail stores 
our product offerings in each product category are relatively few compared to the wide variety of products offered by many of our competitors  and are often premium priced 
as a result  our ability to remain competitive depends in part upon the successful introduction of new products and enhancements of existing products 
we also compete with other network marketing organizations for the time  attention  and commitment of new and current associates 
our ability to remain competitive depends  in significant part  on our success in recruiting and retaining associates 
we believe that we offer a rewarding associate compensation plan and attractive associate benefits and services 
to the extent practicable  our associate compensation plan is designed to be seamless  permitting international expansion without re qualification or re entry requirements 
we pay incentives weekly  reducing the time an associate must wait between purchase and sale of products and payment of commissions 
there can be no assurance that our programs for recruiting and retaining associates will be successful 
we also compete for the time  attention  and commitment of this independent associate force 
the pool of individuals interested in the business opportunities presented by network marketing tends to be limited in each market  and is reduced to the extent other network marketing companies successfully recruit these individuals into their businesses 
although we believe that we offer an attractive opportunity for our associates  there can be no assurance that other network marketing companies will not be able to recruit our existing associates or deplete the pool of potential associates in a given market 
we believe that the leading network marketing company in the world  based on total sales  is amway corporation and its affiliates  and that avon products  inc is the leading direct seller of beauty and related products worldwide 
leading competitors in the nutritional network marketing and nutritional product industry include herbalife international  inc  market america  inc  nature s sunshine products  inc  nbty  nu skin enterprises  inc  twinlab corporation  and weider nutrition 
we believe there are other manufacturers of competing product lines that may launch direct selling enterprises  which will 
table of contents compete with us in certain product lines and for associates 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully meet the challenges posed by this increased competition

and lifescience technologies inc  or lst 
over the years  these acquisitions and asset purchases have added  associates to our ranks and products to our product line 
lst was our most recent acquisition 
on january   we purchased the lst group of companies for million and a five year payment of  per month  or of the gross sales of lst products  whichever is greater 
as a result of this acquisition  we added products and over  associates 
we paid the balance of the acquisition note  plus accrued interest  in full on january  we have historically earned a material portion of our revenues from our am product  which contains ephedra 
in  the fda banned the use of ephedra in nutritional supplements 
while the fda s 
table of contents decision had an adverse effect on our revenues  we had been preparing for this contingency 
over the last several years  through strategic acquisitions  product redevelopment and refocus of weight loss products  we have built a multi product peak performance  weight loss and nutritional product line that is non ephedra 
we have seen positive results in converting our am customers to am ephedra free or other weight loss products 
a majority of the customers have chosen one or more of our other performance based weight loss and nutritional products

the table below reconciles free cash flow to cash flow from operations for the years ended december   and cash flow from operations capital expenditures free cash flow average monthly purchases per associates is calculated by dividing total sales by total number of associate transactions 
critical accounting policies 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the year 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
throughout this report  net sales represents the gross sales amounts reflected on our invoices to our associates  less associate discounts and sales returns 
all of our products include a customer satisfaction guarantee 
our products may be returned within days of purchase for a full refund or credit toward the purchase of another product 
we also have a buy back program whereby we repurchase products sold to an independent associate subject to a restocking fee  provided the associate terminates his her associateship agreement with us and returns the product within months of original purchase in marketable condition 
we receive our net sales price in cash or through credit card payments upon receipt of orders from associates 

table of contents our gross profit consists of net sales less commissions and bonuses  consisting of commission payments to associates based on their current associate level within their organization  and other one time incentive cash bonuses to qualifying associates  cost of products  consisting of the prices we pay to our manufacturers for products  and royalty overrides earned by qualifying associates on sales within their associate organizations  and cost of shipping  consisting of costs related to shipments  duties and tariffs  freight expenses relating to shipment of products to associates and similar expenses 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of products  training aids and promotional material to our independent associates 
all of our customers pay for sales in advance of shipment 
as such  we have no trade receivables 
we used to make loans to associates  which were repayable in five years or less  and which were secured by commissions controlled by us 
associate loans are no longer allowed 
interest rates on loans were typically two percent or more above the prime rate and were fixed 
all loans were secured by guaranteed payment sources that were within our control 
as such  there was no need for an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we were still collecting on prior associate loans as of december  in the total amount of in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this standard requires companies to stop amortizing existing goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives effective january  under the new rules  companies would only adjust the carrying amount of goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets upon an impairment of the goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets 
we implemented these standards effective january  based on an evaluation of goodwill at october   we determined that goodwill of approximately  was impaired and should be written off in its entirety 
our intangible assets consist of non compete covenants and other intangibles  which have a significant residual value 
these intangible assets are being amortized over the life of the contracts 
we evaluate all intangible assets annually for indicators of impairment 
we use an asset and liability approach to account for income taxes 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences and carryforwards by applying enacted tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is established if  in management s opinion  it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
all evidence  both positive and negative  is considered to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed for some or all of a deferred tax asset 
judgment must be used in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
the more negative evidence that exists  a the more positive evidence is necessary and b the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed

we write down our inventory to provide for estimated obsolete or unsalable inventory based on assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
if future demand and market conditions are less favorable than management s assumptions  additional inventory write downs could be required 
likewise  favorable future demand and market conditions could positively impact future operating results if written off inventory is sold 
we account for contingencies in accordance with sfas no

sfas requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable than an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements  and the amount of the loss can be reasonable estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as legal and income tax matters requires us to use 
table of contents our judgment 
many legal and tax contingencies can take years to resolve 
generally  as the time period increases over which the uncertainties are resolved  the likelihood of changes to the estimate of the ultimate outcome increases 
however  an adverse outcome in these matters could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows
