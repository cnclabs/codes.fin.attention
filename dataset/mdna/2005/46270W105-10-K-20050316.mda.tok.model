item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements  which reflect our current views about future events and financial results 
we have made these statements in reliance on the safe harbor created by that private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements include our views on future financial results  financing sources  product development  capital requirements  market growth and the like  and are generally identified by phrases such as anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  intends  plans and similar words 
forward looking statements are merely predictions and therefore inherently subject to uncertainties and other factors which could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statement 
these uncertainties and other factors include  among other things unexpected technical and marketing difficulties inherent in major product development efforts such as the new platform for our urinalysis workstation  the potential need for changes in our long term strategy in response to future developments  future advances in diagnostic testing methods and procedures  as well as potential changes in government regulations and healthcare policies  both of which could adversely affect the economics of the diagnostic testing procedures automated by our products  rapid technological change in the microelectronics and software industries  and increasing competition from imaging and non imaging based in vitro diagnostic products 
set forth below is additional significant uncertainties and other factors affecting forward looking statements 
the readers should understand that the uncertainties and other factors identified in this annual report are not a comprehensive list of all the uncertainties and other factors that may affect forward looking statements 
we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements or the list of uncertainties and other factors that could affect those statements 
overview iris international  inc originally incorporated in california in  was reincorporated in delaware in our company consists of three operating units 
our largest unit  iris diagnostics division  designs  manufactures and markets in vitro diagnostics ivd systems  consumables and supplies for urinalysis 
our statspin subsidiary markets small centrifuges and other processing equipment and accessories for rapid specimen processing  and our advanced digital imaging and research llc adir subsidiary assists in the advancement of proprietary imaging technology while conducting government sponsored research and contract development in imaging and pattern recognition 
we generate revenues primarily from three sources sales of  ivd instruments  ivd consumables and service and small laboratory device instruments and supplies 
sales of ivd consumables supplies and services represent approximately of our revenues and contribute higher gross margins than other sources of revenues 
consumables include products such as chemical reagents and urine test strips 
service revenues are derived primarily from annual service contracts purchased by our domestic customers after the initial year of sale which is covered by product warranties 
once our analyzers and systems are installed  we generate recurring revenue from sales of consumables 
consumable and service revenue will continue to expand as the installed base of related instruments expand 
sales of small laboratory devices and supplies primarily consist of centrifuge systems and related supplies sold by statspin 
sales of statspin s products are made worldwide through distributors 
sales of ivd analyzers  consumables and services are made both domestically and internationally 
domestic sales are made directly by our own sales staff to the customer  whereas international sales are made to 
table of contents independent distributors 
our international sales represented of consolidated net revenues in  compared to in and in with the launch of our new iq analyzer  we have increased our focus on the international marketplace  with the ultimate goal of balancing our urinalysis business between domestic and international markets 
since our international sales are made through independent distributors  gross profit margin is lower than domestic sales of the same products but we do not incur sales and marketing costs for such sale 
we make significant investments in research and development for new products and enhancements to existing products 
we internally fund our research and development programs  and through adir  we also receive government grants to fund various research activities 
the following table summarizes product technology expenditures for the periods indicated in thousands total product technology expenditures during year less amounts capitalized during year to software development costs as reported in the consolidated statements of cash flow less amounts reimbursed through grants for government sponsored research and development research and development expense as reported in the consolidated statements of operations critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies upon which our financial position and results of operations depend are those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  and income tax assets and liabilities 
we summarize our most critical accounting policies below 
revenue recognition revenues are derived from the sale of ivd instruments  sales of consumable supplies and services for ivd systems as well as sales of small laboratory devices and related supplies 
revenue is recognized once all of the following conditions have been met a an authorized purchase order has been received in writing with a fixed and determinable sales price  b customer credit worthiness has been established  and c delivery of the product based on shipping terms 
the majority of domestic ivd instrument sales generally require installation and training to be performed 
revenue is recorded in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf statement revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and staff accounting bulletin sab revenue recognition in financial statements which generally requires revenue earned on product sales involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements 
multiple elements of our domestic product sales include ivd instruments and training 
training elements are valued based on hourly rates  which we charge for these services when sold apart from hardware sales 
accordingly  we allocate revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based on the element s respective fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold and specifically defined in a quotation or contract 
we recognize revenues from service contracts ratably over the term of the service period  which typically ranges from twelve to sixty months 
payments for service contracts are generally received in advance 
deferred revenue represents the revenues to be recognized over the remaining term of the service contracts 

table of contents inventory valuation we value inventories at the lower of cost or market value on a first in  first out basis 
provision for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory is made based on management s analysis of inventory levels and future sales forecasts 
we recognize that although we have introduced our new iq product family of analyzers  an installed based of our legacy products still exist 
we maintain a base supply of service parts for these products  a portion of which is classified as a long term asset on our balance sheet 
management will periodically review the carrying value of such parts to ensure that they continue to have net realizable value 
capitalized software we capitalize software development costs in connection with our development of our urine analyzers in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the cost of capitalized software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
we capitalize software development costs once technological feasibility is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable against future revenues 
capitalized software development costs are expensed to cost of sales over periods up to five years 
when  in management s estimate  future revenues will not be sufficient to recover previously capitalized software development costs  we will expense such items as additional software development amortization in the period the impairment is identified 
such adjustments are normally attributable to changes in market conditions or product quality considerations 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense represents the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 

table of contents results of operations the following table summarizes results of operations data for the periods indicated 
the percentages in the table are based on total revenues with the exception of percentages for cost of goods sold which are computed on related revenue

revenues from the ivd urinalysis segment totaled million in the current year  up from million in the prior year 
sales of ivd instruments increased to million from million  an increase of million  or over our sales 
the increase is primarily due to sales of the iq analyzers and systems first introduced in august as expected  sales of our legacy models diminished during the year 
sales of ivd system consumables and services increased to million from million  an increase of million or over  primarily due to the larger installed base of instruments 
revenues from the small laboratory devices segment increased to million from million  or over this increase is primarily due to increased sales of centrifuges  parts and service within this segment 
revenues also include royalty and license fees and approximately  in as compared to  during such revenue ceased in the third quarter of  as the related license expired and we do not expect to receive any royalty or license fees during the next fiscal year 
the decrease in gross margins over the past two year results from our decision to expand our operations to international markets and lower margins on iq microscopy analyzers due to transitional costs like learning 
table of contents curves  small quantity procurement and the lag time between instrument placement and generation of consumable revenues 
conversely  during  substantially all our sales were to domestic customers 
gross profit margin decreased to in from in gross margin on ivd urinalysis segment was in and in and included gross margin on ivd instruments of in compared to in this improvement is due to a number of factors  including higher production levels in the first full year of production of the iq analyzer which resulted in greater overhead absorption  as well as other efficiencies associated with continued production of the iq the improvement in gross profit margins was offset by increased sales of our product to international independent distributors at lower margins than domestic sales and a  addition to our reserves during for possible obsolescence of slow moving legacy inventory 
gross margin of ivd consumables and services was during compared to during the decrease resulted primarily from increased sales to international independent distributors at lower margins as well as the fact that our instruments include a one year warranty during which period we don t realize service revenue but incur warranty costs 
gross margin for our small laboratory instruments segment amounted to for compared to in the slight increase was due to improved manufacturing overhead absorption due to higher volumes 
marketing and selling expenses totaled million in  compared to million in the prior year  a increase 
as a percentage of sales such expenses during were of revenues compared to the prior year 
the increase relates to additional sales and marketing personnel costs amounting to approximately million plus approximately  relating to travel costs to support the increased sales revenues during the year 
in addition we incurred  of additional costs relating to the expansion of the international distribution support organization 
general and administrative expenses decreased during to million from million in the prior year 
the decrease includes management severance costs during million which did not occur during and partially offset by the cost of compliance with section of sarbanes oxley  nasdaq listing fee  and higher legal fees net research and development expenditures decreased to million for  as compared to million in research and development expenses were net of capitalized software development costs  and reimbursed costs under research and development grants and contracts million 
expenses were down during as compared to the prior year reflecting the reduced product development activity for the iq analyzer 
current year expenditures relate to the new iq sprint product  which was released in the first quarter of  plus ongoing development activities relating to enhancements to existing product lines and research into new products 
we expect to continue to invest in research and development during at the same rate as interest expense decreased to  in from  in the prior year as a result of the outstanding debt being repaid in the second quarter and included the write off of  in deferred loan costs 
interest income for amounted to  an increase from  in and relates to our investment of excess funds during the year 
other expense during includes a permanent write down of a security held for sale in the amount of  during we incurred an income tax provision of approximately million as compared to a tax benefit of  for the year ended december  the tax provision and benefit are non cash items  since we have significant deferred tax assets  primarily relating to tax loss carryforwards 
comparison of year ended december  to net revenues for the year ended december  increased by million or over the prior year 
revenues from the ivd urinalysis segment totaled million in  up from million in the prior year 
sales of ivd instruments increased to million from million  an increase of million  or from the previous year 
the increase is primarily due to the release of the iq analyzer and system in august  and accounted for nearly million of sales in this category 
as expected  sales of our legacy models declined from the prior year 
sales of ivd system consumables and services increased to million from million  an increase of  or over last year  primarily due to the larger installed base of ivd 
table of contents instruments 
revenues from the small laboratory devices segment increased to million from million  an increase of  or over this increase is primarily due to increased sales of centrifuges  parts and service within this segment 
revenues also included royalty and license fees and approximately  in each year 
gross profit margins decreased to during compared to during cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues for the ivd urinalysis segment totaled  up from in the prior year 
cost of goods sold for ivd instruments as a percentage of related sales was in as compared to in this increase was due to a number of factors 
our lower production levels in the first seven months of provided a smaller volume of product sales to absorb overhead costs  small quantity procurements and start up costs related to the production of the new iq in addition a portion of our revenues were lower margin international sales that are made through independent distributors 
we also increased our reserves for obsolescence of slow moving inventory during by approximately  which further contributed to the increase in this segment s cost of goods 
cost of goods sold for ivd consumables and services as a percentage of related sales remained constant during both years at 
cost of goods sold for small laboratory instruments segment as a percentage of related sales totaled for as compared to in this increase was due primarily to increased costs resulting from smaller production runs in the first half of marketing and selling expenses for totaled million  compared to million for  a increase 
the increase was due primarily to the addition of sales and service personnel  additional travel costs  increased commissions due to higher revenues  and increased marketing efforts including trade shows and marketing brochures  all associated with the launch of the iq in addition  we created an international subsidiary and opened offices in milan and hong kong to assist our expansion into the international marketplace 
marketing and selling expenses as a percentage of revenues were in  up from in general and administrative expenses increased million to million in from million in the increase was due to management restructuring costs during the current year million and increased professional fees 
net research and development expenditures decreased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million in total product technology expenditures which include research and development costs  capitalized software development costs and reimbursed costs under research and development grants and contracts amounted to million  down slightly from the prior year with the completion of the iq the majority of the expenditures during related to the new iq product  which was released in the third quarter of interest expense decreased to  in from  in the prior year as a result of lower average interest rates 
the income tax benefit for the year ended december   amounted to  as compared an income tax provision of  in due to the loss experienced in and income experienced during the tax provision and benefit are non cash items  since we have significant deferred tax assets  primarily relating to tax loss carryforwards 

table of contents contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments the following table aggregates our expected minimum contractual obligations and commitments subsequent to december  totals less than year years in thousands contractual obligations capital lease commitments operating lease commitments total contractual cash commitments there were no lease commitments that extended beyond year as presented in the table above 
not included in the table above are normal recurring accounts payable or accrued expenses which are presented on the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is cash from operations  which depends heavily on sales of our ivd urinalysis systems and the subsequent sales of consumables and service for these systems as well as the sale of small laboratory devices and supplies 
during the fiscal year ended december   we also realized million in cash from financing activities  as described below 
our cash and cash equivalents increased million to million at december   up from million at december  operating cash flows 
cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december  amounted to million compared to cash used in operations of million in the prior year 
the primary reason for this change was net income in the current year as compared to a net loss in the prior year 
in addition  we also made investments in receivables and inventory to support our increased business activity  and resulted in funds used in these operating activities during in the approximate amount of million offset by million provided by deferred income taxes which is net of a million tax benefit from stock option exercises  a write down of a security held for sale plus depreciation and amortization and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately million 
the relationship of receivables to revenues has improved over the prior year 
the number of days sales in accounts receivable has improved to days in from days at the end of inventories at the end of have increased by over the prior year 
the higher inventory levels are necessary to support increased production volumes due to the increasing sales during which is anticipated to continue during investing activities 
cash used in investing activities totaled million in  as compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease is due to the reduction in expenditures for property and equipment and capitalized software development from prior year levels 

table of contents financing activities 
for the year ended december   financing activities provided million of cash  compared to million provided during the year ended december  the changes were as follows on april   we signed an agreement with an investment bank for the private placement of million shares of common stock and received net proceeds of million 
in the prior year we sold  in a private placement   shares of common stock and received net proceeds of million 
in april  we repaid all the then outstanding bank debt and notes payable in the amount of million with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of common stock on april  during the year ended december   we received million from the exercises of common stock options and warrants 
in may  we signed a new credit facility with a major bank 
the credit facility consists of a million revolving line of credit for working capital and a million line of credit for acquisitions and product opportunities 
borrowings under the revolving line of credit are limited to a percentage of eligible receivables and inventory 
the entire credit facility has variable interest rates  which will change from time to time based on changes to either the libor rate or the lender s prime rate 
as of december   there were no borrowings under the new credit facility 
we are subject to certain financial covenants under the credit facility with the bank and as of december   we were in compliance with such covenants 
we believe that our current cash on hand  together with cash generated from operations and cash available under the credit facility with the bank will be sufficient to fund normal operations 
however additional funding may be required to fund expansion of our business 
there is no assurance that such funding will be available  on terms acceptable to us 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 chapter sfas no 
clarifies the language used in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
with respect to accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expenses  freight  handling costs and spoilage 
the guidance does not result in a substantive change in accounting for these costs but eliminates inconsistencies in wording between us and international accounting standards 
as such  this pronouncement is not expected to have any material impact on our consolidated statements of operations or financial position 
in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
sfas no 
r is effective for us beginning july  and will require us to expense share based payments under the modified prospective method 
under this method  compensation expense is recognized for all share based payments granted after july  and also for all awards granted prior to july  that remain unvested on the effective date 
we will adopt sfas no 
r effective july  using the modified prospective method 
consequently  compensation expense for awards that we granted prior to july  that are not fully vested on july  will be subject to expense beginning july  under sfas no 
r 
we are currently evaluating the effects of adopting this standard on our results of operations or financial position 
inflation we do not foresee any material impact on our operations from inflation 

table of contents healthcare reform policies in recent years  an increasing number of legislative proposals have been introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures that would effect major changes in the healthcare system  nationally  at the state level or both 
future legislation  regulation or payment policies of medicare  medicaid  private health insurance plans  health maintenance organizations and other third party payors could adversely affect the demand for our current or future products and our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis 
moreover  healthcare legislation is an area of extensive and dynamic change  and we cannot predict future legislative changes in the healthcare field or their impact on our business 

table of contents risk factors risks related to our business our success depends largely on the acceptance of our new iq operating platform 
our current strategy assumes that our iq operating platform will be adopted by a large number of end users 
we have invested and continue to invest  a substantial amount of our resources in promotion and marketing of the iq operating platform in order to increase its market penetration  expand its sales into new geographic areas and enhance and expand its system features 
a failure of our iq operating platform to achieve and maintain a significant market presence  or the failure to successfully implement our promotion and marketing strategy  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
any failure to successfully introduce our future products and systems into the market could adversely affect our business 
the commercial success of our future products and systems depends upon their acceptance by the medical community 
our future product plans include capital intensive laboratory instruments 
we believe that these products can significantly reduce labor costs  improve precision and offer other distinctive benefits to the medical research community 
however  there is often market resistance to products that require significant capital expenditures or which eliminate jobs through automation 
we have no assurance that the market will accept our future products and systems  or that sales of our future products and systems will grow at the rates expected by our management 
if we fail to meet changing demands of technology  we may not continue to be able to compete successfully with our competitors 
the market for our products and systems is characterized by rapid technological advances  changes in customer requirements  and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
our future success depends upon our ability to introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments  enhance current product lines and respond to evolving customer requirements 
our failure to meet these demands could result in a loss of our market share and competitiveness and could harm our revenues and results of operations 
any failure or inability to protect our technology and confidential information could adversely affect our business 
patents 
our commercial success depends in part on our ability to protect and maintain our automated intelligent microscopy or aim and other proprietary technology 
we have received patents with respect to portions of the technologies of aim 
however  ownership of technology patents may not insulate us from potentially damaging competition 
patent litigation relating to clinical laboratory instrumentation patents like the ones we own often involves complex legal and factual questions 
therefore  we can make no assurance that claims under patents currently held by us  or our pending or future patent applications  will be sufficiently broad to adequately protect what we believe to be our proprietary rights 
additionally  one or more of our patents could be circumvented by a competitor 
we believe that our proprietary rights do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties 
however  third parties may assert infringement claims against us in the future 
if we are unsuccessful in our defense against any infringement claim our patents  or patents in which we have licensed rights  may be held invalid and unenforceable 
trade secrets 
we have trade secrets  unpatented technology and proprietary knowledge related to the sale  promotion  operation  development and manufacturing of our products 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  suppliers and consultants 
however  we cannot guarantee that our trade secrets  unpatented technology or proprietary knowledge will not become known or be independently developed by competitors 
if any of this proprietary information becomes known to third parties  we may have no practical recourse against these parties 

table of contents copyrights and trademarks 
we claim copyrights in our software and the ways in which it assembles and displays images 
we also claim trademark rights in the united states and other foreign countries 
however  we can make no assurance that we will be able to obtain enforceable copyright and trademark protection  nor that this protection will provide us a significant commercial advantage 
potential litigation expenses 
offensive or defensive litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights could be time consuming and expensive 
additionally  litigation could demand significant attention from our technical and management personnel 
any change in our ability to protect and maintain our proprietary rights could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our products could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others 
given the complete factual and legal issues associated with intellectual property rights  there can be no assurance that our current and future products do not or will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
a determination that such infringement exists or even a claim that it exists could involve us in costly litigation and have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
we operate in a consolidating industry that creates barriers to our market penetration 
the healthcare industry in recent years has been characterized by consolidation 
large hospital chains and groups of affiliated hospitals prefer to negotiate comprehensive supply contracts for all of their supply needs at once 
large suppliers can often equip an entire laboratory and offer hospital chains and groups one stop shopping for laboratory instruments  supplies and service 
larger suppliers also typically offer annual rebates to their customers based on the customer s total volume of business with the supplier 
the convenience and rebates offered by these large suppliers are administrative and financial incentives that we do not offer our customers 
our plans for further market penetration in the urinalysis market will depend in part on our ability to overcome these and any new barriers resulting from continued consolidation in the healthcare industry 
the failure to overcome such barriers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operation 
since we operate in the medical technology industry  our products are subject to government regulation that could impair our operations 
most of our products are subject to stringent government regulation in the united states and other countries 
these regulatory processes can be lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
additionally  securing necessary clearances or approvals may require the submission of extensive official data and other supporting information 
our failure to comply with applicable requirements could result in fines  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  withdrawal of existing product approvals or clearances  refusal to approve or clear new applications or notices  or criminal prosecution 
if any of these events were to occur  they could harm our business 
changes in existing federal  state or foreign laws or regulations  or in the interpretation or enforcement of these laws  could also materially and adversely affect our business 
changes in government regulation of the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business 
federal and state legislative proposals are periodically introduced or proposed that would affect major changes in the healthcare system  nationally  at the state level or both 
future legislation  regulation or payment policies of medicare  medicaid  private health insurance plans  health maintenance organizations and other third party payors could adversely affect the demand for our current or future products and our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis 
moreover  healthcare legislation is an area of extensive and dynamic change  and we cannot predict future legislative changes in the healthcare field or their impact on our industry or our business 
any impairment in our ability to market our products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation 

table of contents we may not be able to realize the deferred tax asset relating to our tax net operating loss carry forward 
as of december   iris has deferred tax assets of approximately million resulting from the differences between the financial statement and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
there is no assurance that we will be able to generate taxable income in the years that the differences reverse 
also  should the company undergo an ownership change as defined in section of the internal revenue code  the company s nol generated prior to the ownership change would be subject to an annual limitation 
if this occurs  a valuation allowance may be necessary 
our success depends largely on sales of laboratory instruments and related sales of consumables and service contracts 
historically  we derived most of our revenues from the sale of urinalysis instruments 
relatively modest declines in unit sales or gross margins for this product line could diminish our revenues and profits 
in addition  because our installed instruments utilize a large volume of consumables and produce service revenue  any decline in our installed base will diminish our revenues and profits even further 
we rely on independent and some single source suppliers for key components of our instruments 
any delay or disruption in the supply of components may prevent us from selling our products and negatively impact our operations 
certain of our components are obtained from outside vendors  and the loss or breakdown of our relationships with these outside vendors could subject us to substantial delays in the delivery of our products to our customers 
furthermore certain key components of our instruments are manufactured by only one supplier 
for example  arkray is the single source supplier for our new line of urine chemistry analyzers and related consumable products and spare parts 
roche diagnostics is the sole source for our proprietary chemstrip iristrip urine test strips and related urine test strip readers  both used in our legacy instruments  the model and udx urinalysis workstations 
because these suppliers are the only vendors with which we have a relationship for a particular component  we may be unable to sell products if one of these suppliers becomes unwilling or unable to deliver components meeting our specifications 
our inability to sell products to meet delivery schedules could have a material adverse effect on our reputation in the industry as well as our financial condition and results of operation 
one of our single source suppliers has terminated its agreement with us 
roche diagnostics has exercised its right to terminate its agreements with us relating to the supply of test strips and related urine test strip readers 
roche will continue to supply test strips and replacement readers to our installed base of legacy workstations for six years after termination of these contracts or the failure to successfully and timely complete the phase out of their strips and readers with the introduction of our new iq analyzers would have a material adverse affect on our instrument sales and the revenue growth for system supplies and service 

table of contents we face intense competition and our failure to compete effectively  particularly against larger  more established companies will cause our business to suffer 
the healthcare industry is highly competitive 
we compete in this industry based primarily on product performance  service and price 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  technical and human resources than we do  and may also have substantially greater experience in developing products  obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing and distribution 
as a result  they may be better able to compete for market share  even in areas in which our products may be superior 
further  our competitive position could be harmed by the establishment of patent protection by our competitors or other companies 
the existing competitors or other companies may succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective or affordable than those being developed by us or that would render our technology and products less competitive or obsolete 
if we are unable to effectively compete in our market  our financial condition and results of operation will materially suffer 
our success depends on our ability to attract  retain and motivate management and other skilled employees 
our success depends in significant part upon the continued services of key management and skilled personnel 
competition for qualified personnel is intense and there are a limited number of people with knowledge of  and experience in  our industry 
we do not have employment agreements with most of our key employees nor maintain life insurance polices on them 
the loss of key personnel  especially without advance notice  or our inability to hire or retain qualified personnel  could have a material adverse effect on our instrument sales and our ability to maintain our technological edge 
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to retain our key management and skilled personnel  or that we will be able to attract  assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 
defective products may subject us to liability 
our products are used to gather information for medical decisions and diagnosis 
accordingly  a defect in the design or manufacture of our products  or a failure of our products to perform for the use that we specify  could have a material adverse effect on our reputation in the industry and subject us to claims of liability arising from inaccurate or allegedly inaccurate test results 
misuse of our products by a technician that results in inaccurate or allegedly inaccurate test results could similarly subject us to claims of liability 
we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage for up to million per incident and up to an aggregate of million per year 
we also currently maintain a product liability umbrella policy for coverage of claims aggregating to million 
although management believes this liability coverage is sufficient protection against future claims  there can be no assurance of the sufficiency of these policies 
any substantial underinsured loss would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation 
furthermore  any impairment of our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our sales  revenues and prospects for future business 
we have not received any indication that our insurance carrier will not renew our product liability insurance at or near current premiums  however  we cannot guarantee that this will continue to be the case 
in addition  any failure to comply with federal drug administration regulations governing manufacturing practices could hamper our ability to defend against product liability lawsuits 
business interruptions could adversely affect our business 
products for iris diagnostics and statspin are manufactured in a single facility for each division and are vulnerable to interruption in the event of war  terrorism  fire  earthquake  power loss  floods  telecommunications failure and other events beyond our control 
if our facilities were significantly damaged or destroyed by any cause  we would experience delays in locating a new facility and equipment and qualifying the new facility with the fda 
our results would suffer 
in addition  we may not carry adequate business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us could be substantial 

table of contents if we are unable to manage our growth  our results could suffer 
we have been experiencing significant growth in the scope of our operations 
this growth has placed significant demands on our management as well as operational resources 
in order to achieve our business objectives  we anticipate that we will need to continue to grow 
if this growth occurs  it will continue to place additional significant demands on our management and our operational resources  and will require that we continue to develop and improve our operational  financial and other internal controls both in the us and internationally 
in particular  our growth rate has increased  if it continues  will increase the challenges in implementing appropriate control systems  expanding our sales and marketing infrastructure capabilities  providing adequate training and supervision to maintain high quality standards  and preserving our cultural values 
the main challenge associated with our growth has been cash flow management 
our inability to scale our business appropriately or otherwise adopt to growth  could cause our business  financial condition and results of operations to suffer 
our quarterly sales and operating results may fluctuate in future periods  and if we fail to meet expectations the price of our common stock may decline 
our quarterly sales and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to do so in the future due to a number of factors  many of which are not within our control
