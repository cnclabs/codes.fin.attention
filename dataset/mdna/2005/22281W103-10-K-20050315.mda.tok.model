table of contents in  covansys entered into a stock purchase agreement with fis and a recapitalization agreement with a private equity investment fund managed by clayton  dubilier rice  inc the cdr shareholder 
the transactions  which are more fully discussed in note of the financial statements 
the recapitalization agreement with the cdr shareholder restructured the ownership interest in the company that the cdr shareholder had acquired in critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we regularly evaluate and discuss with our audit committee the accounting policies and estimates we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method  impairment assessments of goodwill and other long lived assets  realization of deferred tax assets  allowance for doubtful accounts  and litigation related contingencies 
these estimates are based on historical experience  project management  and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable given the particular facts and circumstances 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions and judgments are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
the securities and exchange commission has defined critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies discussed below 
we have other significant accounting policies  which also involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that are integral to understanding our results of operations 
for a complete discussion of all significant accounting policies  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 for our time and materials and fixed price outsourcing contracts 
for those service contracts which are billed on a time and materials basis  we recognize revenue as the services are performed and after we have a signed contract 
in our time and materials contracts our effort  measured by our time incurred  represents the contractual milestones or output measure which is the contractual earnings pattern 
for our fixed price it outsourcing  maintenance contracts and transaction processing we recognize revenue ratably over the applicable outsourcing or maintenance period as the services are performed continuously over the contract period 
for our contracts to design  develop or modify complex information systems based upon the client s specifications  we recognize revenue on a percentage of completion basis in accordance with statement of position the percentage of completion is determined by relating the actual cost of labor performed to date to the estimated total cost of labor for each contract 
this method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and cost can be made 
estimates of total contract revenue and cost are continuously monitored during the term of the contract  and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses 
such revisions  which may result in increases or decreases to revenue and income  are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are first identified 
if the estimate indicates a loss on a particular contract  a provision is made for the entire estimated loss without reference to the percentage of completion 
covansys periodically enters into contracts that include multiple element arrangements  which may include any combination of services  software  support maintenance  and the re sale of hardware or software 
contracts entered into after june  containing multiple elements or deliverables are segmented into separate units of accounting where the separate elements represent separate earnings processes in accordance with eitf revenue is allocated among the elements based on the relative fair values of the elements 
table of contents and are recognized in accordance with our policies for the separate elements unless the undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements 
in circumstances where an undelivered element is essential to the functionality of the delivered element  no revenue is recognized for the delivered element until the undelivered element is delivered 
retainages are included in revenue earned in excess of billings in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets 
revenue earned in excess of billings is primarily comprised of revenue recognized on certain contracts in excess of contractual billings on such contracts 
billings in excess of revenue earned are classified as deferred revenue 
computer software 
we perform research to develop software for various business applications 
the cost of such research is charged to expense when incurred 
when the technological feasibility of the product is established  subsequent costs are capitalized in accordance with sfas computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
capitalized software costs are amortized on a product by product basis 
amortization is recorded on the straight line method over the estimated economic life of the product  generally five years  commencing when such product is available 
the establishment of technological feasibility and the ongoing assessment of the recoverability of these costs require considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors including  but not limited to  anticipated future gross product revenue  estimated economic product lives and changes in software and hardware technology 
these assumptions are reevaluated and adjusted as necessary at the end of each accounting period 
management reviews the valuation and amortization of capitalized development costs 
we periodically consider the value of future cash flows attributable to the capitalized development costs in evaluating potential impairment of the asset 
amounts charged to expense for research and development of computer software were not material in the periods indicated 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets related to businesses acquired and the acquisition of shares of a subsidiary 
the company continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of goodwill may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable 
the company tests for impairment of its reporting units by comparing fair value to carrying value 
fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology 
the results of the company s annual impairment analysis concluded that no impairment existed at december  income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
realization of deferred tax assets associated with the company s future deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration 
although realization of the deferred tax assets is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable income 
the company utilized domestic net operating loss carryforwards during the effective tax rate was for the full year on a quarterly basis  management assesses whether it remains more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized

table of contents compared to revenue 
revenue in was million  down from million in the decline is primarily due to a continued decline in our public sector and european businesses from million in to million in and million in to million in  respectively 
the decline in these segments was offset by increases in revenue in our commercial and india businesses  including an increase of million of revenue recorded in in connection with an agreement signed with sirva related to services previously provided and a decrease of approximately million in related to the company s determination not to recognize revenue for services provided to a significant customer after reaching the authorized spending limit on the related time and material contract

during we made adjustments to the estimated cost to complete for certain fixed price contracts for which we recognize revenue on the percentage of completion basis 
revenue was negatively impacted by million related to our reassessment of the collectability of outstanding billed and unbilled receivables associated with two troubled projects 
in accordance with the application of percentage of completion accounting  we reflected the changes as a contract price adjustment  and accordingly  as a reduction in revenue 
revenue from india asia on a full attribution basis increased for over to million as compared with million  respectively 
this is due to additional resources added and a higher utilization of indian resources on existing customer relationships and the transfer of certain commercial segment customer relationships to this region 
the company anticipates  based on its current strategic plan  that the majority of its revenue growth in the next few years will be in this segment 
the company had approximately million in revenue in from a customer that is in the process of a merger 
while the company has not been informed of any intent to do so  the customer or its acquirer have the right to terminate the arrangement 
the company believes that should such a termination occur  the customer would need to transition the services either in house or to another provider over some period of time

table of contents the following table presents a summary of payments due for our contractual obligations for operating leases and debt as of december  period after december  within total year to years to years after years in thousands operating leases debt the company anticipates that it will use cash on hand to pay its contractual obligations in factors that may affect future results internal control weaknesses the company has identified a number of internal control weaknesses where its existing internal controls do not reduce to a relatively low level the risk that a misstatement caused by an accounting error may occur in an amount that would be material relative to the financial statements see item a 
such a misstatement may not be detected timely by employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions 
the company s financial reporting process contains a number of systems which are not fully integrated and rely on manual processes 
the loss of key financial personnel exposes the company to the risk that key internal controls may not operate effectively during the transition to new personnel 
impact of changes in estimates on fixed price projects the company realized approximately of its revenue from fixed price contracts percentage of completion as well as fixed price it outsourcing and maintenance 
approximately of the company s revenue was realized from fixed price contracts with respect to which we recognize revenue on a percentage of completion basis 
changes in estimated costs to complete could be unfavorable and change our estimates of the ultimate profitability on these projects 
these projects generally contain payment terms that are tied to the successful achievement of delivered milestones 
these milestones frequently require a substantial level of work and thus expose the company to large unbilled balances 
the ultimate payment of these balances is dependent on the acceptance of the deliverables contractually agreed to relative to each milestone 
these unbilled balances are frequently very large and create collection risk if project milestones are not accepted by the customer 
variability of operating results our revenue and operating results can vary from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors  including the timing and number of client projects commenced and completed during a quarter  changes in the rates we charge clients for services  employee hiring  attrition  utilization and billing rates  progress on fixed price projects during a quarter  and our ability to obtain a written contract prior to the end of a quarter 
because a high percentage of our expenses are fixed  such as personnel and facilities costs  a variation in revenues may cause a significant variation in our quarterly operating results and could result in losses 

table of contents failure to recruit  train and retain skilled it professionals could increase costs or limit growth our continued success depends upon our ability to attract  develop  motivate and retain highly skilled it professionals and project managers with the necessary technical skills and experience who may be in high demand worldwide 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to attract or retain the it professionals that we seek 
exposure to regulatory  political and general economic conditions in india and asia revenue generated by our india and asia operations  as calculated on a full attribution basis  from both direct services provided to clients in india and asia as well as services provided to customers in the united states and europe accounted for of our revenue 
in addition  over of our workforce is located in india and asia 
we benefit directly from certain incentives provided by the indian government to encourage foreign investment  including tax holidays temporary exemptions from taxation on operating income and liberalized import and export duties 
if the indian government changes any of these incentives  it could negatively impact the profitability of our indian operations 
changes in interest rates  inflation rates  tax rates and policies  or other social  political  economic or diplomatic developments affecting india in the future could have an adverse effect on our business 
our operations in europe and india are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations  foreign exchange restrictions and related issues that may adversely impact our operating results 
in addition  if we fail to manage our geographically dispersed operations we may not meet our financial objectives 
our contracts are short term and contain termination provisions many of our contracts have terms of less than one year 
a client may choose not to renew its contract when it terminates 
under some of our contracts  clients may unilaterally reduce the use of our services with little or no notice and without penalty 
many of our contracts have termination provisions and contracts with our public sector state and local clients typically allow for termination for convenience which is required by law 
if we are unable to retain our existing clients  our business could be adversely affected 
an unanticipated termination of a major project could result in a loss of revenues and could require us to pay a number of unassigned it professionals until new engagements can be obtained 
we operate in highly competitive markets the it services industry is highly competitive  undergoing consolidation and is served by many national  regional and local firms  all of which are either existing or potential competitors 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources and greater name recognition than we do 
in addition  there are relatively few barriers to entry into our markets 
we have faced  and we expect to continue to face  additional competition from new entrants into our markets as well as intensive pricing pressures from that competition 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully with existing or new competitors 
some of our clients may experience unique economic conditions that are specific to their particular industry we provide services to clients in a wide variety of industries 
many of the industries are subject to factors and economic conditions that are unique to the particular industry and may not be reflected in the overall health of the economy in general 
our revenue growth and the realizability of our accounts receivable could be adversely affected if our clients in these particular industries encounter economic difficulties 
such difficulties could include the inability of participants in the industry to access the capital or credit markets  business slowdowns due to excess inventory  and shortfalls in demand for the product or service produced by a particular industry

limited protection of intellectual property rights our success depends in part upon certain of our solutions and methodologies that we utilize in providing it services to our clients 
we rely upon a combination of nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and trade secret  copyright and trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights and the proprietary rights of third parties from whom we license intellectual property 
however  these may not be adequate to protect our rights 
failure to properly manage acquisitions and strategic investments we have expanded  and plan to continue to expand our operations through acquisitions of additional businesses 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including diversion of management s attention  failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business  assumption of unanticipated legal liabilities and other problems  and difficulties in integrating systems  operations and cultures we have previously made investments in start up companies that have the potential to be successful and to complement our current business 
investing in these companies is a highly risky strategy 
these companies frequently have a limited operating history  unproven business plans and are exposed to high start up costs
