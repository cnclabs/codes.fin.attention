restatement of financial statements on february   the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission sec issued a letter to the american institute of certified public accountants expressing its views regarding certain operating lease accounting issues and their application under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in light of this letter  the company s management initiated a review of its lease related accounting methods and determined that the company s methods of accounting for amortization of leasehold improvements  leasehold improvements funded by landlord incentives and rent expense prior to commencement of operations and rent payments  while in line with common industry practice  were not in accordance with gaap 
as a result  the company restated its consolidated financial statements for each of the fiscal years ended december  and december   and the first three quarters of fiscal included in this report 
previously the company had amortized its leasehold improvements over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset  or the lease term  including the first five year renewal option for initial term leases of years or less 
management determined that the appropriate interpretation of the lease term under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases  sfas is the sum of the fixed noncancellable term and any options where  at the inception of the lease  renewal is reasonably assured 
management determined that renewal of the majority of lease terms associated with leasehold improvements whose useful lives included the option period  while expected  were not reasonably assured under sfas accordingly  the company accelerated the amortization of those leasehold improvements to coincide with the end of the fixed noncancellable term of the lease 
additionally  the company had historically accounted for leasehold improvements funded by landlord incentives as reductions in the cost of the related leasehold improvements reflected in the consolidated balance sheets and the capital expenditures reflected in investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
management determined that the appropriate interpretation of financial accounting standards board technical bulletin no 
 issues relating to accounting for leases  requires these incentives to be recorded as deferred rent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and as a component of operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
additionally  this adjustment resulted in a reclassification of the deferred rent amortization from depreciation and amortization expense to selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income and included as an additional cost component of capital expenditures in investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
finally  the company had historically recognized rent holiday periods on a straight line basis over the lease term commencing on the related retail store opening date 
the store opening date coincides with the commencement of business operations  which is the intended use of the property 
management re evaluated financial accounting standards board technical bulletin no 
 accounting for operating leases with scheduled rent increases  and determined that  consistent with the letter issued by the office of the chief accountant  the lease term should include the pre opening period of construction  renovation  fixturing and merchandise placement typically two to six months prior to store opening 
the correction of this error requires the company to record additional deferred rent in other accrued expenses and other long term liabilities and to adjust retained earnings in the consolidated balance sheets  as well as to restate rent expense in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
the cumulative effect of these corrections is a reduction to retained earnings of million net of taxes of million as of the beginning of fiscal and reductions to retained earnings of million net of taxes of million  million net of taxes of million and million net of taxes of million for the fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
these adjustments did not have any impact on the overall cash flows of the company 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the effects of this restatement on the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december   as well as the company s consolidated statements of income and cash flows for fiscal years and the accompanying discussion in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations gives effect to these corrections 
seasonality and weather the company s business is highly seasonal 
historically  the company s sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of each year due to the sale of seasonal products 
the company typically operates at approximately break even in the first fiscal quarter of each year 
unseasonable weather  excessive rain  drought  and early or late frosts may also affect the company s sales 
the company believes  however  that the impact of adverse weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of its stores 
the company experiences a buildup of inventory and accounts payable during its first fiscal quarter each year for purchases of seasonal product in anticipation of the april through june spring selling season and again during its third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the october through december winter selling season 
significant accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial position and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company s significant accounting policies  including areas of critical management judgments and estimates  have primary impact on the following financial statement areas inventory valuation self insurance sales returns the company s critical accounting policies are subject to judgments and uncertainties  which affect the application of such policies 
see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report for a discussion of the company s critical accounting policies 
the company s financial position and or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
quarterly financial data as more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company changed its accounting methods for the amortization of leasehold improvements  leasehold improvements funded by landlord incentives  and rent expense prior to commencement of operations and rent payments 
the company s unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of and  restated to reflect this change  are shown below in thousands  except per share amounts first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter total net sales      gross margin      income from operations      net income      net income per share basic diluted same store sales increase first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter total net sales      gross margin      income from operations      net income before cumulative effect of accounting change      net income including cumulative effect of accounting change     net income per share  before cumulative effect of accounting change basic diluted net income per share  including cumulative effect of accounting change basic diluted same store sales increase the previously reported unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of and are shown below in thousands  except per share amounts first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter total net sales      gross margin      income from operations      net income      net income per share basic diluted a same store sales increase a due to a miscalculation in the determination of diluted shares  the company previously reported diluted shares of   and  for the first  second and third quarters of fiscal which resulted in diluted earnings per share of   and  respectively

results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in the company s consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales 
the table reflects actual and pro forma information 
the pro forma information provides results as if the fiscal adoption of eitf had occurred prior to fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
pro forma net sales cost of merchandise sold gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization income from operations interest expense  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales increased to  million in fiscal from  million in fiscal this increase resulted from the opening of new stores as well as a same store sales improvement of 
the company s favorable performance versus prior year was driven primarily by the opening of new stores  market share gains in certain markets  continued improvement in merchandising programs and successful implementation of new initiatives in presentation  purchasing and product selection 
same store sales increases were generally experienced across all product lines  with equine  pet and animal products representing the strongest category 
the company s average ticket increased to for the twelve months ended fiscal increased average transaction counts also contributed to the increase in same store sales 
the same store sales increase includes an approximate gain for fiscal year which is attributed to increases in selling prices resulting from rising steel  grain and petroleum related product costs 
in fiscal  the company opened new stores compared to in the prior year  relocated stores compared to in the prior year and closed one store compared to one in the prior year 
as a percent of sales  gross margin decreased basis points to for fiscal from for fiscal gross margin was negatively impacted primarily by higher than anticipated freight costs caused primarily by increased fuel costs and demand in the freight industry and absorption of some of the impact of higher steel and other commodity costs 
the impact of cost increases was partially recovered through higher selling prices 
as a percent of sales  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were and for fiscal and  respectively 
the loss in sg a leverage was due primarily to approximately million in expenses incurred for the consolidation and relocation of the company s store support center 
additionally  new store openings trailed behind schedule during the middle of the year  resulting in a reduction of sales leverage for related expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense increased in fiscal over the prior year due mainly to costs associated with new and relocated stores  remodeled existing stores and new distribution facilities 
net interest expense decreased in fiscal from the prior year 
this decrease reflects stronger cash flow and less cash requirements for store openings  which resulted in reduced average long term borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement 
the company s effective tax rate was for fiscal compared to in the prior year  resulting primarily from a lower effective state income tax rate due to the allocation of income by state 
as a result of the foregoing factors  net income for fiscal increased to million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in the prior year 
exclusive of the cumulative effect of the change in in the company s method of accounting for consideration received from vendors  net income for fiscal was million or per diluted share 
the increase in net income for fiscal is primarily a result of the factors discussed above and leveraging operating costs with the opening of new stores 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales increased to  million in fiscal from  million in fiscal this increase resulted from the opening of new stores as well as a same store sales improvement of 
the company s favorable performance versus prior year was driven primarily by the opening of new stores  market share gains in certain markets  continued improvement in merchandising programs  improved in store execution and the first full year of operations for the stores opened in fiscal in fiscal  the company opened new stores compared to in the prior year  closed one store compared to three in the prior year and relocated stores compared to in the prior year 
the company substantially expanded its store base during due to its purchase of property and lease rights from quality stores  inc as a percent of sales  gross margin increased basis points to for fiscal from for fiscal assuming the provisions of eitf had been applied prior to fiscal  fiscal gross margin would have decreased basis points from in fiscal the majority of this decline is attributable to a return to a more normal level of vendor funding in fiscal specifically  vendors provided additional funds in fiscal in connection with the opening of new stores as a result of the purchase of certain properties and lease rights from quality stores  inc as a percent of sales  sg a expenses were and for fiscal and  respectively 
assuming the provisions of eitf had been applied prior to fiscal and exclusive of non recurring expansion costs of million experienced in fiscal these costs include pre opening transition and training costs related to the new stores  costs for store relocations and three store closings as a result of the purchase of the aforementioned properties and lease rights from quality stores  inc  fiscal sg a expenses as a percent of sales decreased basis points from for fiscal this decrease is primarily a result of controlled spending and greater leverage from increased sales 
depreciation and amortization expense increased in fiscal over the prior year due mainly to costs associated with new and relocated stores  as well as remodeled existing stores 
net interest expense decreased in fiscal over the prior year 
this decrease reflects stronger cash flow and less cash requirements for store openings  which resulted in reduced average long term borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement 
the company s effective tax rate increased to for fiscal compared with for fiscal this increase is due to increased income in states with higher tax rates 
as a result of the foregoing factors  net income for fiscal increased to million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in the prior year 
exclusive of the cumulative effect of the accounting change  net income for fiscal was million or per diluted share 
this increase is primarily a result of increased leverage from increased sales at both new and existing stores 
additionally  certain store expansion costs incurred in the company s significant expansion in  which was primarily the result of the purchase of property and lease rights from quality stores  inc in the first quarter of  were non recurring 
the expansion increased the size of the company by over and was completed in a very compressed timeframe 
as such  the company incurred significant incremental costs to achieve the state of readiness required to enable all stores to open within the desired time frame and such costs are not considered by management to be indicative of normal pre opening or recurring expenses 
management believes that disclosing the effect of the significant store expansion improves the investor s ability to reasonably evaluate the company s longer term business trends 
change in accounting principle emerging issue task force issue no 
eitf  accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor provides guidance for the accounting treatment and income statement classification for consideration given by a vendor to a retailer in connection with the sale of the vendor s products or for the promotion of sales of the vendor s products 
the eitf concluded that such consideration received from vendors should be reflected as a decrease in prices paid for inventory and recognized in cost of sales as the related inventory is sold 
prior to adopting this pronouncement  the company classified all vendor provided marketing support funds as a reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the effect of applying eitf on prior period financial statements would have resulted in a change to previously reported net income  thus  the company has reported the adoption of eitf as a cumulative effect adjustment 
accordingly  in the first quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change of million million net of income taxes for the impact of this adoption on prior fiscal years 
the following pro forma financial information for the fiscal year ended december  reflects the impact of eitf as if it had been adopted prior to fiscal in thousands  except per share amounts as reported pro forma of of sales sales net sales   cost of merchandise sold   gross margin   selling  general and administrative expenses   depreciation and amortization   income from operations   interest expense  net   income before income taxes   income tax provision   net income   net income per share basic diluted weighted average shares outstanding basic   diluted   liquidity and capital resources in addition to normal operating expenses  the company s primary ongoing cash requirements are for expansion  remodeling and relocation programs  including inventory purchases and capital expenditures 
the company s primary ongoing sources of liquidity are funds provided from operations  commitments available under its revolving credit agreement  capital and operating leases and normal trade credit 
the company s inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the spring and winter selling seasons  respectively 
working capital at december   the company had working capital of million  a million increase from december  this increase is primarily attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities in millions variance current assets cash and cash equivalents inventories prepaid expenses and other current assets other  net current liabilities accounts payable accrued expenses other  net working capital the increases in cash and cash equivalents  prepaid expenses and other current assets  and accrued expenses is generally due to the increase in the number of stores in operation and resulting increases in sales  growth in operations  and timing of payments 
the increase in inventories and related increase in accounts payable resulted primarily from additional inventory for new stores and an increase in average inventory per store due to increased sales expectations and increased cost of certain products containing steel  grain or petroleum 
trade credit arises from the company s vendors granting extended payment terms for inventory purchases 
payment terms generally vary from days to days depending on the inventory product 
borrowings and credit facilities in november  the company entered into a three year unsecured senior revolving credit agreement with bank of america  na  as agent for a lender group  whereby the company was permitted to borrow up to million 
in august  the company entered into a replacement credit agreement with bank of america  na  as agent for a lender group the credit agreement  expanding the maximum available borrowing from million to million  extending the maturity to february and increasing the number of participating banks from seven to ten 
the outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement totaled million at december  and million at december  the balance of funds available under the credit agreement may be utilized for borrowings and up to million for letters of credit  of which million and million were outstanding at december  and december   respectively 
these letters of credit were issued primarily for the purchase of inventory 
the credit agreement bears interest at either the bank s base rate at december  or the london inter bank offer rate libor at december  plus an additional amount ranging from to per annum  adjusted quarterly based on company performance at december  
the company is also required to pay  quarterly in arrears  a commitment fee ranging from to per annum at december  and adjusted quarterly based on company performance  on the average daily unused portion of the credit line 
there are no compensating balance requirements associated with the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains certain restrictions regarding additional indebtedness  capital expenditures  business operations  guarantees  investments  mergers  consolidations and sales of assets  transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates  and liens 
in addition  the company must comply with certain quarterly restrictions based on a rolling four quarters basis regarding net worth  leverage ratio  fixed charge coverage  current ratio requirements and spending limits on capital expenditures 
the company was in compliance with all covenants at december  the credit agreement was amended on january  and september  both amendments included changes to certain financial covenants  primarily to provide flexibility for capital expenditures 
the january amendment extended the maturity to february  and the september amendment extended the maturity to february  sources and uses of cash the company s primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations 
principal uses of cash for investing and financing activities are capital expenditures and payments on debt  respectively 
the following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years in thousands net cash provided by operations net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities the million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal over fiscal is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities in millions variance net income depreciation and amortization deferred income taxes inventories and accounts payable prepaid expenses and other current assets accrued expenses other  net net cash provided by operations the increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal compared with fiscal is primarily due to the improvement in net earnings exclusive of depreciation and amortization  offset by a net increase in inventory and accounts payable 
increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued expenses also contributed to the growth in cash provided by operations 
these increases were primarily due to the growth in the company s business during the year and the timing of payments 
the million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal from fiscal is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities in millions variance net income depreciation and amortization deferred income taxes inventories and accounts payable prepaid expenses and other current assets accrued expenses other  net net cash provided by operations the increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal compared with fiscal is primarily due to the increase in the number of stores in operation 
in addition to the stores opened in  it was also the first full year of operations for the stores opened in as a result of this aggressive expansion  the company experienced a dramatic increase in all working capital components 
strong sales performance generated increased cash flows and inventory requirements thereby driving proportionate increases in operating expenses 
investing activities investing activities used million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the majority of this cash requirement relates to the company s capital expenditures 
the company s significant store expansion  coupled with required investment in infrastructure costs  required the following capital expenditures in thousands new and relocated stores and stores not yet opened    existing stores    distribution center capacity and improvements   information technology    corporate and other  the company s long term growth strategy anticipates continued geographic market expansion  further concentration within existing markets and additional investment in distribution facilities 
this growth will require continuing investment in information technology and people 
the costs reflected are typically building improvements as the company leases the majority of its facilities 
the company currently estimates that capital expenditures will be approximately million in fiscal  as follows in thousands new and relocated stores and stores not yet opened  existing stores  distribution center capacity and improvements  information technology  corporate and other financing activities financing activities provided million  used million  and provided million in fiscal  and  respectively  largely as a result of borrowing requirements created by operations  partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of stock under stock incentive programs 
the company believes that its cash flow from operations  borrowings available under the credit agreement  and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund the company s operations and its capital expenditure needs  including store openings  relocations and renovations  over the next several years

the company has outstanding standby letters of credit of million as of december  off balance sheet arrangements the extent of the company s off balance sheet arrangements is operating leases and outstanding letters of credit 
the balances for these arrangements are discussed above 
leasing buildings and equipment for retail stores and offices rather than acquiring these significant assets allows the company to utilize financial capital to operate the business rather than maintain assets 
letters of credit allow the company to purchase inventory in a timely manner 
known trends  events  demands  commitments and uncertainties litigation and internal investigation in july  a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the chancery court for davidson county  tennessee by the hawaii laborers pension plan against each of the company s directors  certain of its officers and one former director 
the company was named as a nominal defendant 
on september   the plaintiff filed an amended complaint which alleged breaches of fiduciary duty  acts of bad faith  abuse of control  mismanagement  waste of corporate assets  unjust enrichment and other violations of tennessee law relating to the preparation of the company s financial statements 
the amended complaint sought  on behalf of the company  unspecified damages  a constructive trust on certain of the defendant s proceeds from selling company stock  injunctive relief  restitution  the plaintiff s costs and disbursements and such other relief as the court deemed proper 
on october   the company moved to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to make a pre suit demand on the board of directors 
on december   the court granted the company s motion to dismiss and ordered that all claims in the amended complaint be dismissed without prejudice 
on february   the court entered an order denying a motion by the plaintiff to alter or amend the december  order and judgment dismissing the amended complaint 
the plaintiff has until march  to file a notice of appeal of the order 
the audit committee of the board of directors has completed its previously disclosed investigation of the claims set forth in the derivative lawsuit 
in july  shortly after the company learned of the derivative lawsuit  the board of directors directed the audit committee to conduct an investigation of the allegations 
these allegations concerned the company s accounting accruals and reserves for inventory  employee bonuses  payroll related liabilities and vendor credits 
the audit committee promptly retained independent legal counsel with no prior connection to the company to assist the audit committee in evaluating these issues 
the audit committee and its advisors were provided with full access to company employees and documents 
during the course of the audit committee s investigation  independent counsel  with the assistance of accountants that they retained  interviewed company employees  met with the company s external auditors  and reviewed a substantial amount of documentation related to the issues described above 
the audit committee later expanded the review to encompass the company s other reserves or accruals that involved management judgment 
based on the investigation of the allegations described above  the audit committee determined that there were no material errors requiring restatement of the company s previously reported financial statements as they relate to such matters and found no evidence of fraud or misconduct by any of the company s employees 
in reaching its conclusion that restatement of the company s previously reported financial statements was not required  the audit committee considered the impact of the documentation insufficiencies and or errors on each of the periods affected  the lack of any material changes in prior period trends or earnings  the nature of the documentation insufficiencies and errors  and the age of financial statements impacted 
the audit committee has reported its findings to the company s board of directors and management  both of whom concurred with the audit committee s determination 
the company s external auditors have also concurred with the determination 
while the audit committee determined that restatement of the company s prior reported financial statements was not required for such matters  the audit committee found the following documentation insufficiencies and or errors o in fiscal  management calculated a total accrual of million for the company s excess and slow moving inventory valuation reserve 
a million portion of this reserve representing approximately of the total year end inventory balance relating to costs anticipated to be incurred to move inventory from one store location to another was not sufficiently supported 
in fiscal  the rationale and calculation of this portion of the reserve was changed to a mechanical formula  but a million portion of the reserve representing of the total year end inventory was still not sufficiently supported 
by the third quarter of fiscal  the entire inventory valuation reserve was properly supported 
o due to larger than typical performance based bonuses in fiscal  the maximum limits on certain fringe benefits were met  resulting in a lower than estimated fringe benefit expense being incurred 
this circumstance resulted in the year end estimate being overstated by  also  due to forfeitures resulting from employee terminations after the end of year  the company s ultimate incentive payments for fiscal were reduced by  the combination of these two circumstances resulted in the company s incentive expense for the first quarter of fiscal being reduced by  o in estimating certain payroll related liabilities for fiscal through the second quarter of fiscal  management did not sufficiently document its rationale and support for certain judgments concerning estimated claims incurred but not reported for medical costs  workers compensation and general liability 
since the second quarter of fiscal  the rationale and support for these liabilities have been fully documented 
the audit committee concluded that the items addressed above have been fully corrected  also noting that management has dedicated additional accounting and other resources to these areas to further enhance controls 
following the december dismissal of the derivative suit  attorneys representing the plaintiff in the shareholder derivative suit wrote the company s board of directors demanding that the company commence legal proceedings against the directors and officers whom the plaintiff had unsuccessfully sued for essentially the same matters alleged in the derivative suit 
the company s board of directors engaged the independent legal counsel and legal counsel retained the accountants which assisted the audit committee in its investigation of the allegations in the derivative suit to advise the board with respect to the demand 
following a review of the investigation of the allegations set forth in the demand letter and the derivative suit  the non employee members of the company s board of directors determined that the claims proposed in the demand letter and derivative suit have no merit and that pursuing such claims would not be in the best interests of the company 
based on this determination  the company s board of directors refused the shareholder s demand to pursue legal action 
self insurance during the third fiscal quarter of  the company determined  through assistance with insurance industry analysts  that one of its former insurance carriers appears insolvent 
the carrier insures the company for both workers compensation and general liability claims for policy years through the company s exposure to related claims are at risk of not being limited to previously established stop loss aggregates 
a charge of million was recognized in the current year for the estimated additional cost to the company due to the expected loss of stop loss coverage 
this additional estimated liability was determined using a third party actuary service 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur additional claims in excess of the estimated amounts 
sales tax compliance a portion of the company s sales are with tax exempt customers 
the company obtains exemption information as a necessary part of each tax exempt transaction 
many of the states in which the company conducts business will audit the company to verify its compliance with applicable sales tax laws 
the business activities of the company s customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by the company create a challenging and complex environment of compliance 
these circumstances also create some risk that the company could be challenged as to the propriety of its sales tax compliance 
while the company believes it reasonably enforces sales tax compliance with its customers and endeavors to fully comply with all applicable sales tax regulations  there can be no assurance that the company  upon final completion of such audits  would not have a significant liability for disallowed exemptions 
management believes it has adequately provided for such liability based on known assessments and expected settlements 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb published fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r or the statement 
sfas r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
sfas r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including stock options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans

the statement will have no impact on the company s overall financial position 
the impact of this statement on the company s results of operations in fiscal and beyond is expected to be significant and will depend upon various factors  among them being future compensation strategies 
the impact of adoption of this statement cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
the pro forma compensation costs presented in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements and in prior filings for the company have been calculated using a black scholes option pricing model and may not be indicative of amounts which should be expected in future years 
as of the date of this filing  the company has not determined which option pricing model is most appropriate for future option grants or which method of adoption the company will apply

risk factors effect of inflation on operations although the company cannot accurately determine the full effect of inflation on its operations  it believes its sales and results of operations have been affected by inflation 
during fiscal  the company recognized a lifo charge of approximately million relating to inflation in certain product categories such as steel  grain and petroleum based products 
the company has also experienced inflation in transportation and other costs 
the company increased its retail prices to recoup a portion of this inflation  resulting in a positive impact on same store sales of an estimated 
the company is subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services  which include  among other items  steel  grain  petroleum  corn  soybean and other commodities as well as transportation services 
if prices of these materials and services continue to increase in a significant manner  consumer demand may fall and or the company may not be able to pass such increases on to its customers and  as a result  sales and or gross margins could decline 
the company has been successful in reducing or mitigating the effects of inflation  principally through selective buying from the most competitive vendors and by increasing retail prices 
due to the competitive environment  such conditions have and may continue to adversely impact the company s gross margins 
growth through opening new stores the company s key business strategy is to expand its base of tractor supply company stores 
if the company is unable to implement this strategy  the company s ability to increase its sales  profitability  and cash flow could be impaired significantly 
to the extent that the company is unable to open new stores as the company anticipates due to unforeseen delays in construction or site approval  the company s sales growth would be dependent on increases in same store sales 
management of growth even if the company is able to implement  to a significant degree  its key business strategy of expanding its store base  it may experience managerial or operational problems  which may prevent any significant increase in profitability or negatively impact its cash flow 
competition the company operates in a highly competitive market 
the principal competitive factors include location of stores  price and quality of merchandise  in stock consistency  merchandise assortment and presentation  and customer service 
the company believes it has successfully differentiated itself from general merchandise  home center retailers and other specialty and discount retailers by focusing on its specialized market niche ie  supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle  as well as tradesmen and small businesses 
however  the company does face select competition from these entities  as well as competition from independently owned retail farm and ranch stores  several privately held regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives 
some of these competitors are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater financial and other resources than the company 
improvements to the company s supply chain may not be fully successful an important part of the company s efforts to achieve efficiencies  cost reductions  and sales and cash flow growth is the identification and implementation of improvements to the company s supply chain  including inventory replenishment systems  merchandise ordering  transportation  and receipt processing 
significant changes to the company s supply chain could have a materially adverse impact on operating results 
changes in customer demands could materially adversely affect the company s sales  operating results and cash flow the company s success depends on its ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demand and preferences for products and supplies used in recreational farming and ranching 
if the company misjudges the market  the company may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced to take significant inventory markdowns 
however  shortages of key items could also have a materially adverse impact on operating results 
risks relating to foreign suppliers the company relies on foreign manufacturers for various products that we sell 
in addition  many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources 
this reliance increases the risk of inadequate and untimely supplies of various products due to local political  economic  social  or environmental conditions  transportation delays  restrictive actions by foreign governments  or changes in united states laws and regulations affecting imports or domestic distribution 
seasonality and weather the company s business is highly seasonal 
historically  the company s sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of each year due to the sale of seasonal products 
the company typically operates at approximately break even in the first quarter of each year 
unseasonable weather  excessive rain  drought  and early or late frosts during the second or fourth quarters of each year could have a significant affect the company s sales and results of operations 
the company believes  however  that the impact of adverse weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of its stores 
our information systems may prove inadequate the company depends on management information systems for many aspects of its business 
the company will be materially adversely affected if management information systems are disrupted or it is unable to improve  upgrade  maintain  and expand systems  particularly in light of the continued significant increases in the number of stores
