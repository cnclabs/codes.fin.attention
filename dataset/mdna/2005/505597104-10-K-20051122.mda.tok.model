the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
results of operations laclede group s earnings are primarily derived from the regulated activities of its largest subsidiary  laclede gas company laclede gas or the utility  missouri s largest natural gas distribution company 
laclede gas is regulated by the missouri public service commission mopsc or commission and serves the metropolitan st 
louis area and several other counties in eastern missouri 
laclede gas delivers natural gas to retail customers at rates  and in accordance with tariffs  authorized by the mopsc 
the utility s earnings are primarily generated by the sale of heating energy  which historically had been heavily influenced by the weather 
however  as part of the rate case settlement  the utility initiated  effective november   an innovative weather mitigation rate design that lessens the impact of weather volatility on laclede gas customers during cold winters and stabilizes the utility s earnings by recovering fixed costs more evenly during the heating season 
the weather mitigation rate design minimizes the impact of weather volatility during the peak cold months of december through march and reduces the impact of weather volatility  to a lesser extent  during the months of november and april 
due to the seasonal nature of the business of laclede gas  earnings are typically concentrated in the november through april period  which generally corresponds with the heating season 
the utility typically experiences losses during the non heating season 
the seasonal effect of the utility s earnings on laclede group is generally expected to be tempered somewhat by the results of sm p utility resources  inc sm p  a non regulated underground facility locating and marking service business  whose operations tend to be counter seasonal to those of laclede gas 
laclede energy resources  inc ler  is engaged in non regulated efforts to market natural gas and related activities 
other non regulated subsidiaries provide less than of consolidated revenues 
laclede group s strategy continues to include efforts to stabilize and improve performance of its core utility  while developing non regulated businesses and taking a measured approach in the pursuit of additional growth opportunities that complement the utility business 
as for the utility  mitigating the impact of weather fluctuations on laclede gas customers while improving the ability to recover its authorized distribution costs and return continues to be a fundamental component of the laclede group strategy 
the utility s distribution costs are the essential  primarily fixed expenditures it must incur to operate and maintain a more than  mile natural gas distribution system and related storage facilities 
in addition  laclede gas is working to continually improve its ability to provide reliable natural gas service at a reasonable cost  while maintaining and building a secure and dependable infrastructure 
the utility s income from off system sales remains subject to fluctuations in market conditions 
some of the factors impacting the level of off system sales include the availability and cost of its natural gas supply  the weather in the utility s service area  and the weather in other markets 
when laclede gas service area experiences warmer than normal weather while other markets experience colder weather or supply constraints  some of the utility s natural gas supply is available for off system sales and there may be a demand for such supply in other markets 
wholesale natural gas prices have recently risen to unprecedented levels across the nation 
laclede gas is continuing to work actively to reduce the impact of such increases by strategically structuring its natural gas supply portfolio and through the use of financial instruments 
nevertheless  the costs of purchased gas are anticipated to increase substantially 
the utility s purchased gas adjustment clause pga allows laclede gas to flow through to customers  subject to prudence review  the cost of purchased gas supplies  including costs  cost reductions  and related carrying costs associated with the use of financial instruments to hedge the purchase price of natural gas 
while the utility believes it will continue to be able to obtain sufficient gas supply  the higher natural gas prices nationwide may affect sales volumes due to the conservation efforts of customers and cash flows associated with the timing of collection of gas costs and related accounts receivable from customers 
laclede group continues to develop its non regulated subsidiaries 
sm p is working to further the logical expansion of its business in both new and existing markets  having already made notable gains by adding business in several key markets after experiencing setbacks in fiscal year ler continues to focus on growing its markets on a long term and sustainable basis by providing both on system utility transportation customers and customers outside of laclede gas traditional service area with another choice in unregulated natural gas suppliers

labor agreement laclede gas had a labor agreement that expired july  with locals and of the paper  allied industrial  chemical energy workers international union  two locals that represent approximately of laclede gas employees 
on august   laclede gas and union representatives reached a new four year labor agreement replacing the prior agreement

on april   missouri natural gas and union representatives reached a new four year agreement replacing the prior agreement 
the new contract applies through april  critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following represent the more significant items requiring the use of judgment and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements allowances for doubtful accounts estimates of the collectibility of trade accounts receivable are based on historical trends  age of receivables  economic conditions  credit risk of specific customers  and other factors 
employee benefits and postretirement obligations pension and postretirement obligations are calculated by actuarial consultants that utilize several statistical factors and other assumptions related to future events  such as discount rates  returns on plan assets  compensation increases  and mortality rates 
the amount of expense recognized by the utility is dependent on the regulatory treatment provided for such costs 
certain liabilities related to group medical benefits and workers compensation claims  portions of which are self insured and or contain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit exposure  are established based on historical trends 
goodwill valuation in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances occur that may reduce the value of goodwill 
in performing impairment tests  valuation techniques require the use of estimates with regard to discounted future cash flows of operations  involving judgments based on a broad range of information and historical results 
if the test indicates impairment has occurred  goodwill would be reduced  adversely impacting earnings 
laclede gas accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
this statement sets forth the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for those companies whose rates are established by or are subject to approval by an independent third party regulator 
the provisions of sfas no 
require  among other things  that financial statements of a regulated enterprise reflect the actions of regulators  where appropriate 
these actions may result in the recognition of revenues and expenses in time periods that are different than non regulated enterprises 
when this occurs  costs are deferred as assets in the balance sheet regulatory assets and recorded as expenses when those amounts are reflected in rates 
also  regulators can impose liabilities upon a regulated company for amounts previously collected from customers and for recovery of costs that are expected to be incurred in the future regulatory liabilities 
management believes that the current regulatory environment supports the continued use of sfas no 
and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable through the regulatory process 
we believe the following represent the more significant items recorded through the application of sfas no 
the utility s purchased gas adjustment pga clause allows laclede gas to flow through to customers  subject to prudence review  the cost of purchased gas supplies  including the costs  cost reductions and related carrying costs associated with the utility s use of natural gas financial instruments to hedge the purchase price of natural gas 
the difference between actual costs incurred and costs recovered through the application of the pga are recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities that are recovered or refunded in a subsequent period 
the company records deferred tax liabilities and assets measured by enacted tax rates for the net tax effect of all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes  and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
changes in enacted tax rates  if any  and certain property basis differences will be reflected by entries to regulatory asset or liability accounts for regulated companies  and will be reflected as income or loss for non regulated companies 
pursuant to the direction of the mopsc  laclede gas provision for income tax expense for financial reporting purposes reflects an open ended method of tax depreciation 
laclede gas provision for income tax expense also records the income tax effect associated with the difference between overheads capitalized to construction for financial reporting purposes and those recognized for tax purposes without recording an offsetting deferred income tax expense 
these two methods are consistent with the regulatory treatment prescribed by the mopsc 
for further discussion of significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report on form k on page regulatory matters at the state level  there have been several important developments during the fiscal year affecting laclede gas 
laclede gas previously appealed the mopsc s decision in its rate case relative to the calculation of its depreciation rates 
the circuit court remanded the decision to the mopsc based on inadequate findings of fact 
the mopsc upheld its previous order and laclede gas appealed this second order to the circuit court 
in  the circuit court ruled that the mopsc s second order was lawful and reasonable  and laclede gas appealed the circuit court s decision to the missouri court of appeals for the western district 
on march  the court of appeals issued an opinion remanding the decision to the mopsc based on the mopsc s failure to support and explain its decision with adequate findings of fact 
in may  the court of appeals rejected the mopsc s request that the court reconsider its opinion or transfer this matter to the missouri supreme court 
on january   the commission issued an order ruling in favor of laclede gas on the depreciation issue 
as a direct result of the commission s order ruling in favor of the utility s position  laclede gas increased certain of its depreciation rates effective february  resulting in higher annual depreciation expense totaling million  as it originally requested 
that same order also required that operating expenses related to actual removal costs  which the utility began expensing as incurred during fiscal year pursuant to a previous commission order  be reduced by million annually 
as such  the commission s decision had no effect on net income or the utility s recovery of depreciation expenses during fiscal year however  the commission s confirmation of laclede gas position on the proper method for calculating depreciation rates will result in increased cash flows from capital recovery upon implementation of new base rates effective october  resulting from settlement of the utility s rate proceeding 
on june   the staff of the mopsc filed its recommendation in a proceeding established to review laclede gas gas costs for fiscal year in its recommendation  the staff proposed to disallow approximately million in pre tax gains achieved by laclede gas in its incentive based price stabilization program 
this program was discontinued at the end of the heating season 
laclede gas vigorously opposed the adjustment in proceedings before the mopsc  including a formal hearing that was held on this matter in february nevertheless  on april   the mopsc decided by a vote to disallow the million in pre tax gains achieved by laclede gas  and directed laclede gas to flow through such amount to its customers in its november pga filing 
laclede gas appealed the mopsc s decision through various courts ultimately resulting in the missouri western district court of appeals reversing the commission s decision on the grounds that it was unlawful and not supported by competent and substantial evidence on the record 
consistent with the court of appeals decision  on april   the commission issued its order on remand reversing its april  decision and directing that laclede gas be permitted to retain the million 
the commission s order on remand is now final and unappealable 
the return of the pre tax gains  however  was previously recorded as income in the fiscal year  so the decision had no effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
laclede gas filed its first infrastructure system replacement surcharge isrs filing with the mopsc on march  to increase revenues by approximately million annually 
the filing was made pursuant to a missouri law  enacted in  that allows gas utilities to adjust their rates up to twice a year to recover certain facility related expenditures that are made to comply with state and federal safety requirements or to relocate facilities in connection with public improvement projects 
on june   the mopsc approved a stipulation and agreement s a between laclede gas and the staff of the commission that provided for a million annual surcharge effective june  laclede gas made its second isrs filing on october  to increase revenues by approximately an additional million annually 
on january   the mopsc approved an s a between laclede gas and the staff of the commission that provided for a million annual increase in isrs revenues effective january  laclede gas made its third isrs filing on april  to increase revenues by approximately an additional million annually 
on june   the mopsc approved an s a between laclede gas and the staff of the commission that provided for a million annual increase in isrs revenues effective july  these surcharges  totaling million annually  were reset to zero effective october  as the isrs related costs were included in new base rates established in the utility s rate proceeding 
the utility will continue to adjust rates up to twice per year to recover such costs in the future 
on february   laclede gas filed tariff sheets with the mopsc requesting a general rate increase of approximately million 
although the filing requested an annual increase of million  as of the date of the filing million of that amount was already being billed to customers through the isrs  which would cease upon the effective date of new rate schedules approved by the mopsc 
on august   laclede and several parties to the rate proceeding filed an s a that resolved all issues in the rate case 
the mopsc approved the s a on september   to be effective october  the approved s a provided for an increase in base rates for the utility by million  million of which was already being billed to customers under the isrs  resulting in a million net increase compared to the company s previous rates 
in addition  the approved s a provided that laclede s purchased gas adjustment pga rates would be increased by million to recover the costs laclede incurs to finance its investment in gas supplies that it injects underground in the summer for sale during the winter 
together  the base and pga rate increases raised the company s rates by million annually  net of the isrs which by law was reset to zero effective upon implementation of the new rates 
under the approved settlement  laclede gas will provide approximately million annually to fund a new low income energy assistance program to help the utility s most vulnerable customers with their utility bills in exchange for their commitment to conserve energy and improve their payment performance  and will increase the funding for the utility s existing low income weatherization program from million to million annually 
laclede gas will also contribute million annually to fund an expansion of the number and size of various energy efficiency programs that customers can use to reduce consumption of natural gas and save on their utility bills 
the settlement approved by the commission also allows laclede gas to retain certain revenues it realizes from the release of pipeline capacity and the sale of gas to off system customers  provides an opportunity to retain a portion of any savings the utility is able to achieve in connection with the procurement of gas supplies and related financial hedging instruments  continues its present weather mitigation rate design  and fully implements the utility s depreciation method  which was affirmed by the commission in january pursuant to the terms of the s a  higher depreciation rates will become effective january  on july   missouri governor matt blunt signed senate bill into law 
this law  which becomes effective january   authorizes the missouri public service commission to implement rules and tariff provisions through which rates can be adjusted between general rate case proceedings to reflect increases and decreases in certain costs and revenues 
for gas utilities like laclede gas  these include rate adjustments to reflect revenue changes resulting from the impact of weather and conservation on customer usage and to reflect changes in the costs to comply with environmental laws  rules and regulations 
on october   laclede gas filed an application requesting authority for the purchase of certain assets of fidelity natural gas  inc  located in sullivan  missouri 
the purchase  contingent on the approval of the mopsc as well as other conditions  will add approximately  natural gas customers to laclede gas service area

inflation the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the historical costs of events and transactions  regardless of the purchasing power of the dollar at the time 
due to the capital intensive nature of the business of laclede gas  the most significant impact of inflation is on the depreciation of utility plant 
rate regulation  to which laclede gas is subject  allows recovery through its rates of only the historical cost of utility plant as depreciation 
while no plans exist to undertake replacements of plant in service other than normal replacements and those under existing replacement programs  laclede gas believes that any higher costs experienced upon replacement of existing facilities would be recovered through the normal regulatory process

these ratings remain subject to review and change by the rating agencies 
cash flows the company s short term borrowing requirements typically peak during colder months when laclede gas borrows money to cover the gap between when it purchases its natural gas and when its customers pay for that gas 
changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas  variations in the timing of collections of gas costs under the utility s pga clause  the seasonality of accounts receivable balances  and the utilization of storage gas inventories cause short term cash requirements to vary during the year  and can cause significant variations in the utility s cash provided by or used in operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended was million  an million increase  compared with fiscal year the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to the net effects of changes in accounts payable  accounts receivable  deferred purchased gas cost  and the cost of natural gas storage inventories  all of which were impacted by changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas 
net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended was million  compared with cash used in operating activities in fiscal year totaling million

market risk laclede gas adopted a risk management policy that provides for the purchase of natural gas financial instruments with the goal of managing price risk associated with purchasing natural gas on behalf of its customers 
this policy prohibits speculation 
costs and cost reductions  including carrying costs  associated with the utility s use of natural gas financial instruments are allowed to be passed on to the utility s customers through the operation of its purchased gas adjustment clause  through which the mopsc allows the utility to recover gas supply costs 
accordingly  laclede gas does not expect any adverse earnings impact as a result of the use of these financial instruments 
at september   the utility held approximately million mmbtu of futures contracts at an average price of per mmbtu 
additionally  approximately million mmbtu of other price risk mitigation was in place through the use of option based strategies 
these positions have various expiration dates  the longest of which extends through march in the course of its business  laclede group s non regulated marketing affiliate  ler  enters into fixed price commitments associated with the purchase or sale of natural gas 
ler manages the price risk associated with these commitments by either closely matching the offsetting physical purchase or sale of natural gas at fixed prices or through the use of exchange traded futures contracts to lock in margins 
at september   ler s open positions were not material to laclede group s financial position or results of operations 
environmental matters laclede gas owns and operates natural gas distribution  transmission and storage facilities  the operations of which are subject to various environmental laws  regulations and interpretations 
while environmental issues resulting from such operations arise in the ordinary course of business  such issues have not materially affected the company s or laclede gas financial position and results of operations 
as environmental laws  regulations  and their interpretations change  however  laclede gas may be required to incur additional costs 
environmental issues have arisen in the past  and may arise in the future  associated with sites formerly owned or operated by laclede gas and or its predecessor companies  including facilities at which manufactured gas operations took place 
laclede gas has been advised of the existence of three former manufactured gas plant mgp sites that may require remediation and has worked with federal and state environmental regulators to address two of the three sites 
with regard to a former mgp site located in shrewsbury  missouri  laclede gas and state and federal environmental regulators have agreed upon certain remedial actions and those actions are essentially complete 
laclede gas currently estimates the overall costs of these actions will be approximately million 
as of september   laclede gas has paid or reserved for these actions 
if regulators require additional remedial actions or assert additional claims  laclede gas will incur additional costs 
laclede gas enrolled a second former mgp site into the missouri voluntary cleanup program vcp 
the vcp provides potential opportunities to minimize the cost of site cleanup while maximizing possibilities for site development 
this site is located in  and is presently owned by  the city of st 
louis  missouri 
the city is exploring development options for the site 
laclede gas also continues to evaluate options concerning this site 
laclede gas currently estimates that the cost of site investigations  agency oversight and related legal and engineering consulting to be approximately  laclede gas has paid or reserved for these actions 
laclede gas has requested that other former site owners and operators share in these costs 
one party has agreed to participate and has reimbursed laclede gas to date for  laclede gas plans to seek proportionate reimbursement of all costs relative to this site from other potentially responsible parties to the extent practicable 
laclede gas has been advised that a third former mgp site may require remediation 
laclede gas has not owned this site for many years 
at this time  it is not known whether laclede gas will incur any costs in connection with environmental investigations of or remediation at the site  and if it does incur any such costs  what the amount of those costs would be 
while the amount of future costs relative to the actions laclede gas has taken at the shrewsbury site pursuant to the current agreement with state and federal regulators may not be significant  the amount of costs relative to future remedial actions regulators may require at the shrewsbury site and at the other sites is unknown and may be material 
laclede gas has notified its insurers that it seeks reimbursement for costs incurred in the past and future potential liabilities associated with the three mgp sites identified above 
in response  the majority of insurers have reserved their rights 
while some of the insurers have denied coverage  laclede gas continues to seek reimbursement from them 
in june  an outside consultant retained by laclede gas completed an analysis of the mgp sites to determine cost estimates for a one time contractual transfer of risk from the insurers to the company of environmental coverage for the mgp sites 
that analysis demonstrated a range of possible future expenditures to investigate  monitor and remediate these mgp sites from million to million 
this analysis is based upon currently available facts  existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations 
the actual costs that laclede gas may incur could be materially higher or lower depending upon several factors  including whether remedial actions will be required  final determination of any remedial actions  changing technologies and governmental regulations  the ultimate ability of other potentially responsible parties to pay and any insurance recoveries 
costs associated with environmental remediation activities are accrued when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable 
as of the date of this report  laclede gas has recorded all such costs 
however  it is possible that future events may require some level of additional remedial activities that  in turn  would require laclede gas to record additional costs 
laclede gas anticipates that any costs it may incur in the future to remediate these sites  less any amounts received as insurance proceeds or as contributions from other potentially responsible parties  would be deferred and recovered in rates through periodic adjustments approved by the mopsc 
accordingly  potential liabilities associated with remediating the mgp sites are not expected to have a material impact on the future financial position and results of operations of laclede gas or the company 
off balance sheet arrangements laclede group has no off balance sheet arrangements
