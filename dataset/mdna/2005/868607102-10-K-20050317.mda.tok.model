item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
comparison of with revenue includes net sales and other income 
net sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million over the million for the year ended december  all of the company s major product lines increased over the levels experienced in the largest increase in net sales was in the company s dry freight product line which grew million over the balance of the increase in net sales was spread over its remaining product lines 
the opening of the company s northwest production facility in oregon contributed million to the increase in net sales  primarily in the dry freight area 
the improving market conditions experienced in the fourth quarter of carried over into on a unit basis  new orders increased approximately  and backlog grew to a record million 
the company anticipates demand to remain strong barring any negative repercussions from the significant price increases passed on to its customers during the year 
while the company implemented several price increases during the year  these price increases only impacted revenues by an estimated to due to the company s significant backlog and policy of honoring quotes outstanding at the time of the increase 
other income decreased million to 
million in from million in gains on sale of property  plant and equipment were  in compared to million in and this accounted for most of the decrease in other income 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined in to from in the startup and training costs of approximately million at the company s new oregon manufacturing facility impacted margins  however  the most significant cause for the decrease in gross profit was the unprecedented rise in the company s raw material costs 
the following table presents the components of cost of sales as a percentage of net sales and their change from year to year 
december  december  percent change materials direct labor 
overhead delivery 
gross profit the company experienced rapidly escalating raw material costs throughout the most significant increases were encountered in the company s steel purchases which aggregate approximately of total raw material purchases 
steel costs  on average  increased approximately during from the levels paid during cost of all other major raw material items also increased significantly in from the levels experienced in cost of resins and gelcoats used in the company s composites products increased and  respectively 
plywood costs spiked as high as  but leveled off at over prices paid in other items experiencing cost increases as compared with were flooring at and aluminum at to 
the company s major suppliers indicated that they do not see an end to escalating raw material costs 
raw materials anticipated to be most affected in are steel  resins and gelcoats 
the company is seeking to purchase its raw material requirements at the best terms and prices possible and is expanding vendor relationships both domestically and internationally 
page of the slight increase in direct labor of 
was attributed primarily to startup and training costs at the company s bus operation in california  its new oregon facility and  to a lesser extent  the armored plant startup in texas 
both overhead and delivery expenses improved as a percentage of net sales in when compared to the improvement in overhead was due to the fixed nature of certain expenses that do not fluctuate when volume changes 
the company has been unfavorably impacted since by rising overhead expenses that the company has been unable to pass on due to competitive market conditions 
the categories that have felt the most pressure are commercial and general liability insurance  workers compensation insurance and group health insurance 
to improve gross profit and mitigate rising material costs  the company implemented a series of price increases beginning in march the most recent price increase was effective january  the cumulative effect of these price increases now totals approximately 
product lines containing large amounts of steel and composite materials had price increases significantly above average 
prior to the march increases  the company had not had a price increase since june industry practice is such that price increases take effect approximately days after announcement 
in addition  firm backlogged orders historically have been honored and not subject to price increases for either escalating material cost increases or otherwise 
as a result of significant backlogs approximately to days throughout the year  each of the price increases did not take effect for to months after announcement 
therefore  we estimate that approximately million of material cost increases were not recovered through price increases in to help eliminate the effect of the above industry practices  the company now makes its price increases effective immediately  while attempting to include escalation provisions in large fleet orders 
with regard to dealer and direct non fleet backlogged business  the company is evaluating various strategies for more post order pricing flexibility 
changing historical industry practices is a long te rm effort and therefore should material costs continue to escalate  there will continue to be a degree of material cost increase absorption due to the delay in effectiveness of price increases 
in addition  competitive conditions in certain markets and products affect the net selling price the company may realize and it is difficult to predict the effect our price increases may have on customer demand 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million or of net sales in compared to million or of net sales in the largest component of selling  general and administrative expense was compensation related expense which comprised approximately and of total selling  general and administrative expenses in and  respectively 
the dollar increase in relates to additional commission expense on increased net sales  additional incentive programs that resulted in higher volume and investment in upgrading the company s sales literature 
the company benefited from cooperative marketing income in both and in approximately the same dollar amounts 
these cooperative marketing funds  received from original equipment manufacturers oem  are used to offset marketing and promotional expenses for the company s products 
there is no assurance that these programs will continue or that the company will benefi t from these programs as the oem tend to reduce them as their business improves 
interest expense increased  in to  from  in the increase in interest expense was primarily the result of gradually increasing interest rates and additional borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement to fund increases in accounts receivable and inventories associated with substantially higher net sales throughout page of the company s effective income tax rate was for compared to in the favorable rate reduction in resulted from federal and state research and development tax credits claimed on amended tax filings 
additionally  other tax reserves were credited to income as they were no longer required as the result of the favorable conclusion of tax audits or the expiration of the statute of limitations on open years see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
net income for was million  or 
per diluted share compared to million  or 
per diluted share in net income was negatively impacted principally by raw material cost increases and positively impacted by the lower effective tax rate as previously discussed 
liquidity and capital resources the company s revolving line of credit  net income and depreciation and amortization were the major sources of cash flows during the company increased the availability under its revolving credit agreement from million to million for the period january through june of each year 
the availability returns to million for the period july through december of each year 
the increase is necessary to fund the company s working capital needs during the first six months of the year when its large consumer rental customers require the bulk of their deliveries 
inventories were up million and accounts receivables were up million at december  from december  an increase of million in accounts payable at december  helped fund the working capital requirements 
the company invested million in property  plant and equipment during major additions were made in texas  pennsylvania and georgia 
the company purchased acres and a  sq 
ft 
building for million to support its growing armored truck business in cleburne  texas 
it also invested 
million in machinery and equipment for this facility  that will be utilized for the truck product lines as well as the armored truck business 
this will give the company processing abilities it previously had to purchase from others  reduce the labor content of its products as well as reduce the amount of inventory on hand 
the company purchased acres and a  sq 
ft 
manufacturing facility adjacent to its primary facility in jonestown  pennsylvania for million 
this purchase will enable us to consolidate operations that will enhance efficiency  provide needed chassis storage space and increase capacity 
an additional 
million was spent to b ring the facility to a production ready state 
we also invested million in equipment for the pennsylvania plant 
the major item was a combination turret laser for 
million which will allow us to reduce the labor content of our product as well as reduce inventories and scrap 
the other major capacity addition was in our georgia facility for additional capacity for the southeast 
we invested 
million for acres adjacent to our existing georgia property 
we are currently constructing a  sq 
ft 
manufacturing facility that is in process 
we invested 
million in this facility during the cost to complete this facility in is estimated to be 
million and production is expected to begin late first quarter or early second quarter of the company s former manufacturing facility in wilson  north carolina closed in the third quarter of continues to be listed for sale  however  we have been unable to sell this facility because of economic conditions and excess buildings in this region 
we expect the ultimate net sales price will exceed the million carrying value and the sales proceeds would provide additional liquidity 
the company believes that cash flow generated from operations and funds available under the company s revolving line of credit will be sufficient to meet the company s cash needs during page of comparison of with revenue includes net sales and other income 
for the year ended december   net sales increased million to million from million for the year ended december  other income increased million to million from 
million in the prior year 
supreme s dry freight product lines  which represented of net sales in  were responsible for the majority of the increase in net sales 
sales of supreme s line of specialty transit buses and trolley replicas decreased slightly during when compared to while a small decrease of sales was realized in these bus product lines on a year over year basis  the company was encouraged as each quarter showed gains when compared to the immediately preceding quarter 
these bus product lines represented of net sales in compared to in the company s specialized line of spartan service and cargo products showed a slight revenue decline of million in when compared to the company was the first to introduce these specialized products to the market 
these products have since been duplicated by virtually every competitor  accounting for the slight decline in net sales 
the company s line of refrigerated products declined 
million in when compared to this decline was due to the closing of the wilson  north carolina plant  which primarily manufactured refrigerated product lines  in the third quarter of the company s smaller niche product lines  armored vehicles and fiberglass bodies  showed improvement in over the company experienced improving market conditions primarily during the last quarter of for the year  new orders increased compared to the company has also received a  unit  million order for products to be manufactured and delivered during the first six months of the million increase in other income was principally attributable to gains on the sale of two properties 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in compared to in the gross profit margin for was negatively impacted by 
as a result of a 
million impairment charge included in cost of sales for the north carolina facility held for sale 
material costs as a percentage of net sales increased in compared to primarily as a result of extremely competitive pricing conditions in virtually all of the company s product lines brought about by excess industry capacity 
the company and its competitors are experiencing improving market conditions which should reduce the excess capacity that was available in the company has not experienced any significant material cost increase over the last two years but is anticipating both rising material cost and  in certain instances  availability issues as market conditions improve 
the company experienced a slight decline in direct labor as a percentage of net sales in as compared to this decline is attributed to a shift in product mix in compared to the company s frp van product line  which is less labor intensive than the aluminum van product line  increased significantly in compared to resulting in the improvement in direct labor as a percentage of net sales 
overhead expenses as a percentage of net sales were down slightly in as compared to overhead expenses have been unfavorably impacted over the last three years as the company has incurred increases in their costs but could not pass them through to the customer due to the extremely competitive market conditions 
commercial and general liability insurance  workers compensation insurance and group health insurance have been under intense upward pressure 
while there is some indication the pressure in commercial insurance is abating  the areas of group health and workers compensation insurance are still under intense upward pressure 
page of selling  general and administrative expenses were million or of net sales in compared to million or of net sales in the largest components of selling  general and administrative expenses were compensation related expenses which comprised approximately and of total selling  general and administrative expenses in and  respectively 
incentive and commission compensation  as well as a concerted effort to improve the company s product research and development  were responsible for the slight increase in selling  general and administrative compensation costs 
these efforts will continue in the company s efforts in promoting its products through special marketing programs  combined with oem cooperative advertising income  are a substantial part of the company s marketing efforts 
oem marketing income accounted for of the total spent on selling  general and administrative expenses in and in 
with improving economic conditions there can be no assurance that the company will continue to benefit from these incentives 
interest expense declined  in when compared to this decline resulted from favorable interest rates combined with less borrowing during most of the improved market conditions experienced at the end of  which are expected to continue through  will likely result in increased revolving line of credit borrowings that could result in higher interest expense in the company s effective income tax rate was and for and  respectively 
the provision for state income taxes had increased primarily the result of fluctuations in state taxable income and varying tax rates in the states in which the company transacts business 
contractual obligations our fixed  noncancelable obligations as of december  were as follows payments due by period less than more than total year years years years debt a      operating leases b    total      a amounts are included on the consolidated balance sheets

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in management s opinion  the company s critical accounting policies include allowance for doubtful accounts  excess and obsolete inventories  inventory relief  accrued insurance and accrued warranty 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would affect our future operating results 
page of excess and obsolete inventories the company must make estimates regarding the future use of products and provides a provision for obsolete or slow moving inventories 
if actual product life cycles  product demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required which would affect future operating results 
inventory relief for monthly and quarterly financial reporting  cost of sales is recorded and inventories are relieved by the use of standard bills of material 
because of the customized nature of the company s products  it is difficult to place full reliance on the bills of material for accurate relief of inventories 
although the company continues to refine the process of creating accurate bills of materials  manual adjustments  which are based on estimates  are necessary to assure correct relief of inventories for products sold 
the estimate calculations consider the customized nature of products  historical inventory relief percentages  scrap variances and other factors which could impact inventory relief 
the accuracy of the inventory relief is not known until the annual physical inventories and it is not practical to consider more frequent physical inventories because of the sales order backlog and the costs associated with ceasing production for the p urpose of conducting physical inventories 
if the annual physical inventories result in significant favorable or unfavorable adjustments  such adjustments would affect future operating results 
accrued insurance the company has a self insured retention against product liability claims with insurance coverage over and above the retention 
the company is also self insured for a portion of its employee medical benefits and workers compensation 
product liability claims are routinely reviewed by the company s insurance carrier and management routinely reviews other self insurance risks for purposes of establishing ultimate loss estimates 
in addition  management must determine estimated liability for claims incurred but not reported 
such estimates and any subsequent changes in estimates may result in adjustments to our operating results in the future 
accrued warranty the company provides limited warranties for periods of up to five years from the date of retail sale 
estimated warranty costs are provided at the time of sale and are based upon historical experience 
pending accounting policies see new accounting standards to be adopted in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements  other than historical facts  which reflect the view of the company s management with respect to future events 
when used in this report  words such as believe  expect  anticipate  estimate  intend  and similar expressions  as they relate to the company or its plans or operations  identify forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements are based on assumptions made by  and information currently available to  the company s management 
although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  and it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such expectations include  without limitation  limitations on the availability of ch assis on which the company s product is dependent  availability of raw materials  raw material cost increases and severe interest rate increases 
furthermore  the company can provide no assurance that such raw material cost increases can be passed on to its customers through implementation of price increases for the company s products 
the forward looking statements contained herein reflect the current view of the company s management with respect to future events and are subject to those factors and other risks  uncertainties and assumptions relating to the operations  results of operations  cash flows and financial position of the company

page of control risks while the company believes its control systems are effective  there are inherent limitations in all control systems  and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
the company continues to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls  disclosure controls  and other requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of our management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors or all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
in addition  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within the company have been detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
further  controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more persons  or by management override of the controls 
the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
over time  a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
because of inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  operations of the company are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
these fluctuations can vary the cost of investing  financing and operating 
the company s primary risk exposure results from changes in short term interest rates 
in an effort to manage risk exposures  the company strives to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions 
the company s revolving line of credit is floating rate debt and bears interest at the bank s prime rate or libor plus certain basis points depending on the pricing option selected and the company s leverage ratio 
the company has been party to interest rate swap agreements  which exchanged floating rate for fixed rate interest payments 
the final interest rate swap agreement matured in may and there were none in existence at december  based on the company s overall interest rate exposure at december   a hypothetical percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the financial instruments as of december   would have no material impact on earnings  cash flows or fair values of interest rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period
