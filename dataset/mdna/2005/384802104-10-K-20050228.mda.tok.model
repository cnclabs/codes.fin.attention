grainger serves customers through a network of branches  distribution centers and multiple web sites 
beginning january   grainger s integrated supply business will no longer offer on site integrated purchasing and tool crib management services and will be merged into grainger s industrial supply division within the branch based distribution segment 
grainger industrial supply plans to fulfill  but not renew  existing integrated supply contracts 
as such  in integrated supply will no longer be reported as a separate segment and grainger will report its operating results in two segments branch based distribution and lab safety 
business environment 
several economic factors and industry trends shape grainger s business environment 
the current overall economy and leading economic indicators forecast by economists provide insight into anticipated economic factors for the near term and help in the development of projections for the upcoming year 
at the start of  the consensus forecast usa is predicting gdp and industrial production growth of to percent for in  grainger benefited from the economic recovery in the united states 
grainger s sales correlate positively with production growth 
with the improvement in industrial production and general growth in the economy  grainger realized an increase in sales across all customer segments 
grainger s sales also tend to increase when non farm payrolls grow  especially during economic recoveries 
non farm payrolls increased approximately  on average  in over for  grainger benefited from the combination of increased industrial production and non farm payroll growth 
the light and heavy manufacturing customer segments  which comprised over of grainger s total sales  have historically correlated with manufacturing employment levels and manufacturing production 
manufacturing employment levels increased less than during  while manufacturing output increased approximately 
this contributed to the double digit sales growth in the light and heavy manufacturing customer segments for grainger in economic forecasts suggest that the manufacturing sector will continue to expand in in  grainger launched a multiyear initiative to strengthen its presence in top metropolitan markets and better position itself to serve the local customer 
the success of the market expansion program is expected to be a driver of growth in and beyond 
three phases of the market expansion program were in progress at december   and are scheduled for completion in additional phases are scheduled for and beyond 
the customer s buying behavior is also important in grainger s business environment 
grainger believes that customers will continue to focus on reducing their cost to procure facilities maintenance products 
grainger is therefore increasing product information available to employees for improved service to customers by installing an upgraded sap operating system and accelerating the replacement of its legacy information systems with a new integrated software package also provided by sap  starting with the us branch based businesses 
integration  volume and user acceptance testing is currently scheduled for the third quarter of grainger s financial strength  including its low debt and strong cash flow  leaves it well positioned to fund major initiatives  improve effectiveness and accelerate top line growth 
capital spending in related to the branch network and information technology was approximately million  with total capital expenditures of nearly million 
capital spending was approximately million higher than the most recent forecast due to the acceleration of the replacement and upgrade of the branch communication systems and the ongoing sap initiatives 
in  total capital expenditures of to million are anticipated 
grainger intends to continue its investment in the market expansion program and information technology enhancements with spending planned for the following major projects to million for continued market expansion  to million for information technology  and to million for canadian branch programs 
capital spending for the market expansion program may be affected by lease or purchase decisions  based on availability of facilities

the increase in net sales was realized in the branch based distribution and lab safety segments of the business  while net sales in the integrated supply segment were essentially flat year over year 
the gross profit margin of in improved percentage points over the gross profit margin of in  principally due to product cost reduction programs  including the global sourcing of products  combined with selected price increases in and the positive effect of product mix

operating earnings of million in declined by million  or  as compared with the increase in operating expenses year over year more than offset the improvement in gross profit margin 
lab safety net sales at lab safety increased by million to million in  a increase over the sales growth was attributable to incremental sales from gempler s  acquired on april  excluding the results of gempler s  year over year net sales decreased as a result of weakness in the manufacturing sector of the us economy 
a major portion of lab safety s sales are to manufacturers 
the overall decline in the manufacturing sector was partially offset by increased sales to customers in the forestry and public safety markets 
the gross profit margin of decreased percentage point due to incremental sales of gempler s products  which have lower gross margins than the rest of lab safety s products 
in addition  in there was a shift in sales mix to lower margin new product sales 
lab safety operating expenses of million increased in  when compared with million for the primary driver of the year over year increase was the incremental costs associated with the addition of gempler s during the year and higher spending on catalog media 
as a result  operating earnings of million for lab safety in declined from operating earnings of million in integrated supply integrated supply net sales of million in were million lower than million of net sales in the decrease in net sales resulted from six site disengagements  as well as lower volumes from existing customers

cumulative effect of accounting change effective january   grainger adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in the second quarter of  grainger completed the initial process of evaluating goodwill for impairment under sfas no 
fair values of reporting units were estimated using a present value method that discounted future cash flows 
when available and as appropriate  comparative market multiples were used to corroborate results of the discounted cash flows 
as a result of the application of the impairment methodology introduced by sfas no 
 grainger recorded a noncash charge to earnings of million million after tax  or per diluted share related to the write down of goodwill of its canadian subsidiary  acklands 
previous accounting rules required a comparison of book value to undiscounted cash flows  whereas the new rules require a comparison of book value to discounted cash flows  which are lower 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
financial condition grainger expects its strong working capital position and cash flows from operations to continue  allowing it to fund its operations including growth initiatives and capital expenditures  as well as the payment of long term debt  the repurchases of shares and the payment of cash dividends at or above historical levels 
cash flow net cash flows from operations of million in  million in and million in continued to improve grainger s financial position and serve as the primary source of funding 
net cash provided by operations increased million in over driven primarily by increased net earnings 
the change in operating assets and liabilities net of business acquisition and joint venture contributions generated cash of million in trade accounts payable increased due to higher inventory purchases in the fourth quarter of increases in profit sharing and bonus accruals  driven by an improved performance  resulted in an increase in other current liabilities 
these changes were essentially offset by increases in inventory  as well as trade accounts receivable  which were up due to higher december sales 
the increase in net cash flows from operations from to was primarily attributable to increased net earnings and an improvement in working capital management 
a reduction in inventory  resulting from efficiencies realized from the redesigned logistics network  was partially offset by a decrease in trade accounts payable from lower inventory purchases during the fourth quarter of net cash flows used in investing activities were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
capital expenditures for property  buildings  equipment and capitalized software were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
additional information regarding capital spending is detailed in the capital expenditures section below 
in  grainger also funded million to purchase gempler s  which is part of the lab safety segment 
the results of operations for gempler s have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date of april  net cash flows used in financing activities for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
during  grainger liquidated its cross currency swap and related commercial paper debt with payments totaling million 
grainger s funding of treasury stock purchases increased million in  as grainger repurchased  shares in  compared with  shares in treasury stock purchases were  in as of december   approximately million shares of common stock remained available under grainger s repurchase authorization 
dividends paid to shareholders were million in  million in and million in partially offsetting these cash outlays were proceeds from stock options exercised of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
working capital internally generated funds have been the primary source of working capital and for funds used in business expansion  supplemented by debt as circumstances dictated 
in addition  funds were expended for facilities optimization and enhancements to support growth initiatives  as well as for business and systems development and other infrastructure improvements 
working capital was  million at december   compared with million at december   and million at december  at these dates  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was  and  respectively 
the current ratio increased in principally due to grainger s liquidation of the cross currency swap and related commercial paper debt that had been classified in current liabilities in capital expenditures in each of the past three years  a portion of operating cash flow has been used for additions to property  buildings  equipment and capitalized software as summarized in the following table for the years ended december  in thousands of dollars land  buildings  structures and improvements   furniture  fixtures  machinery and equipment   subtotal    capitalized software    total    in  grainger s investments included the market expansion program  which is designed to re align branches in several metropolitan markets  ongoing sap initiatives  an upgrade of the branch communication systems and expenditures related to canadian branch and systems projects 
capital expenditures in related to grainger s investment in its logistics network  which was completed in march  spending for information technology upgrades  as well as the normal  recurring replacement of equipment 
capital spending in reflects incremental spending for the logistics network project that began in capital expenditures are expected to range between to million in and include investments for the ongoing market expansion program  information technology and canadian branch programs  as well as other general projects including the normal  recurring replacement of equipment 
grainger believes that cash flows from operations will remain strong and expects to fund the capital investments from existing working capital 
debt grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and long term cash requirements 
in addition to internally generated funds  grainger has various sources of financing available  including commercial paper sales and bank borrowings under lines of credit 
at december   grainger s long term debt rating by standard poor s was aa 
grainger s available lines of credit  as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  were million  million and million  as of december   and  respectively 
total debt as a percent of total capitalization was  and as of the same dates 
in september  grainger received net proceeds of million from the issuance of commercial paper 
the proceeds were used to repay outstanding long term debt in the amount of c million 
the long term debt that was repaid with the proceeds of the commercial paper issuance had been designated by grainger as a nonderivative hedge of grainger s net investment in its canadian subsidiary 
grainger entered into a two year cross currency swap on september   which replaced the canadian dollar long term debt as a hedge of the net investment in grainger s canadian subsidiary 
the counterparty to the financial instrument was an investment grade financial institution 
grainger did not incur any loss from nonperformance by this counterparty 
since grainger had the ability to refinance the commercial paper with debt having a longer maturity  and its intent was to keep the debt outstanding for the two year period of the cross currency swap  the commercial paper was originally classified as long term debt 
at december   grainger had not determined if it would renew the cross currency swap when it came due in and as a result the commercial paper debt was classified as current maturities of long term debt 
on september   the cross currency swap and related commercial paper debt matured and were liquidated with payments totaling million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
grainger believes any circumstances that would trigger early payment or acceleration with respect to any outstanding debt securities would not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition 
holders of industrial revenue bonds have various rights to require grainger to redeem these bonds  thus they are classified as current maturities of long term debt 
commitments and other contractual obligations at december   grainger s contractual obligations  including estimated payments due by period  are as follows payments due by period total amounts committed less than year years years more than years in thousands of dollars long term debt obligations   capital lease obligations operating lease obligations     purchase obligations uncompleted additions to property  buildings and equipment    commitments to purchase inventory   other purchase obligations     other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet total      purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs 
while purchase orders for both inventory purchases and noninventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty  certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract 
the commitments and other contractual obligations table does not include million of accrued employment related benefits costs  of which million is related to grainger s postretirement benefits 
these amounts are excluded because a portion of the projected benefit payments has already been funded by grainger and the timing of future funding requirements is not known 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
see also notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements grainger does not have any material exposures to off balance sheet arrangements 
grainger does not have any variable interest entities or activities that include nonexchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses in the financial statements 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions  which it believes are reasonable 
if actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates  the revisions are included in grainger s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and when different estimates than those management reasonably could have made have a material impact on the presentation of grainger s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow 
actual results in these areas could differ materially from management s estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
postretirement healthcare benefits 
postretirement obligation and net periodic cost are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts 
the assumptions used include  among others  discount rates  assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates 
changes in assumptions caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience  for example could have a material effect on grainger s postretirement benefit obligations and expense  and could affect its results of operations and financial condition 
these changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation 
the discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on high quality fixed income debt instruments as of december  the measurement date  of each year in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic postretirement benefit costs 
as of december   grainger reduced the discount rate used in the calculation of its postretirement plan obligation from to to reflect the decline in interest rates 
grainger estimates that the reduction in the expected discount rate will decrease pretax earnings by approximately million 
grainger considers the long term historical actual return on plan assets and the historical performance of the standard poor s index to develop its expected long term return on plan assets 
in  grainger maintained the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of net of tax at based on the historical average of long term rates of return 
grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time  subject to the provisions of the employee retirement income security act of erisa and the internal revenue code  as amended 
in the event the postretirement plan is terminated  all assets of the group benefit trust inure to the benefit of the participants 
the foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue 
were the postretirement plan to terminate  different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable 
while grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates  and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate  changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience and new trends and therefore  may affect grainger s retirement plan obligations and future expense 
for additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
insurance reserves 
grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers compensation  general liability and property losses through the utilization of deductibles and self insured retentions 
there are also certain other risk areas for which grainger does not maintain insurance 
grainger is responsible for establishing policies on insurance reserves 
although it relies on outside parties to project future claims costs  it retains control over actuarial assumptions  including loss development factors and claim payment patterns 
grainger performs ongoing reviews of its insured and uninsured risks  which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve level 
the use of assumptions in the analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time 
any change in the required reserve balance is reflected in the current period s results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
grainger uses several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including the age of the receivable and the historical ratio of actual write offs to the age of the receivable 
the analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry  group of customers or a specific customer 
write offs could be materially different than the reserves provided if economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends 
inventory reserves 
grainger establishes inventory reserves for shrinkage and excess and obsolete inventory 
provisions for inventory shrinkage are based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage or loss 
actual inventory shrinkage could be materially different from these estimates affecting grainger s inventory values and cost of merchandise sold 
grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities of inventory 
grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value 
estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand  market conditions and liquidation values 
actual results differing from these projections could have a material effect on grainger s results of operations 
income taxes 
grainger accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the tax balances and income tax expense recognized by grainger are based on management s interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions 
income tax expense reflects grainger s best estimates and assumptions regarding  among other items  the level of future taxable income  interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities 
future tax authorities rulings and future changes in tax laws and their interpretation  changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by grainger 
other 
other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
policies relating to revenue recognition  depreciation  intangibles  long lived assets and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission 
possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of grainger 
more information on these additional accounting policies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
inflation and changing prices inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations 
the predominant use of the last in  first out lifo method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements 
the major impact of inflation is on buildings and improvements  where the gap between historic cost and replacement cost continues for these long lived assets 
the related depreciation expense associated with these assets increases if adjustments were to be made for the cumulative effect of inflation 
grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lies in the continued application of basic business principles  which include improving productivity  increasing working capital turnover and offering products and services which can command appropriate prices in the marketplace 
forward looking statements this document contains forward looking statements under the federal securities laws 
the forward looking statements relate to grainger s expected future financial results and business plans  strategies and objectives and are not historical facts 
they are often identified by qualifiers such as will  expects  intends  is likely  anticipated  scheduled  believes  positioned to  continue  estimates  forecast  predicting  projection  potential  assumption or similar expressions 
there are risks and uncertainties the outcome of which could cause grainger s results to differ materially from what is projected 
factors that may affect forward looking statements include the following higher product costs or other expenses  a major loss of customers  increased competitive pricing pressure on grainger s businesses  failure to develop or implement new technologies or other business strategies  the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings  changes in laws and regulations  facilities disruptions or shutdowns  disruptions in transportation services  natural and other catastrophes  unanticipated weather conditions  and other difficulties in achieving or improving margins or financial performance 
trends and projections could also be affected by general industry and market conditions  gross domestic product growth rates  general economic conditions including interest rate and currency rate fluctuations  global and other conflicts  employment levels and other factors 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk grainger is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to its transactions  assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
during a portion of and all of  grainger partially hedged its net canadian dollar investment in acklands with a cross currency swap agreement 
this agreement was terminated in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
for  a uniform strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect grainger and its joint ventures would have resulted in a million decrease in net income 
comparatively  in a uniform strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect grainger and its joint ventures would have resulted in a million decrease in net income 
a uniform weakening of the us dollar would have resulted in a million increase in net income for  as compared with an increase in net income of million for this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices 
grainger does not hold derivatives for trading purposes 
grainger is also exposed to interest rate risk in its debt portfolio 
during and  all of its long term debt was variable rate debt 
a one percentage point increase in interest rates paid by grainger would have resulted in a decrease to income of approximately million for and million for a corresponding increase in net income for the noted periods would have resulted had the interest rates paid decreased by one percentage point 
this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in interest rates on long term debt does not factor in potential changes in exchange rates or long term debt levels 
grainger s level of interest rate risk has been reduced due to the liquidation of the cross currency swap and related commercial paper debt during see note to the consolidated financial statements 
grainger is not exposed to commodity price risk since it purchases its goods for resale and does not purchase commodities directly
