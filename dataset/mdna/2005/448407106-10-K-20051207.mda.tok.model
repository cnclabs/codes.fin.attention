item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected historical consolidated financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
general since the late s  we have derived virtually all of our revenue from the sale of suspension assemblies to a small number of customers 
we currently supply a variety of suspension assemblies and suspension assembly components to nearly all manufacturers of disk drives and manufacturers of disk drive components for all sizes of disk drives 
suspension assemblies are a critical component of disk drives and our results of operations are highly dependent on the disk drive industry 
the disk drive industry is intensely competitive  and demand for disk drive components fluctuates 
our results of 
table of contents operations are affected from time to time due to disk drive industry demand changes  adjustments in inventory levels throughout the disk drive supply chain  technological changes that impact suspension assembly demand  shifts in our market position and our customers market position  our customers production yields and our own product transitions and production capacity utilization 
our shipments of suspension assemblies in were million  higher than our shipments in this increase was due to strong demand for suspension assemblies resulting from increased shipments for disk drives  demand for data storage outpacing the rate of improvement in data density for disk drives in mass production and our share positions on types of disk drives in particularly high demand 
for calendar disk drive shipments are expected to reach million units  an increase of about from calendar the growth in disk drive shipments is resulting from increased demand for data storage in traditional computing applications as well as in consumer electronics applications 
in calendar  demand for storage is outpacing the rate of improvement in data density for disk drives in mass production 
the rate of data density improvement in calendar has remained about flat with the prior year at approximately 
as a result  achieving the higher storage capacities necessary for many disk drive applications has required using both sides of a single disk in a disk drive or adding disks 
we estimate this caused the number of suspension assemblies required per disk drive to increase from an average of about in calendar to an average of about in calendar in contrast  when the rate of data density improvement outpaces demand for storage  the average number of suspension assemblies required per disk drive decreases 
for example  from calendar to  the average number of suspension assemblies required per disk drive declined from approximately to approximately our suspension assembly shipments in also benefited from our share position on types of disk drives in particularly high demand 
these included higher capacity disk drives for computing applications such as near line storage  as well as consumer electronics applications such as personal video recorders 
shipments of suspension assemblies in the first three quarters of were million  million and million  respectively 
we believe that we experienced an increase in shipments of about million suspension assemblies in the first quarter of  primarily from an increase in demand and an increase in the average number of suspension assemblies per disk drive 
during the second and third quarters of  shipments continued to increase due to strong demand for suspension assemblies for higher capacity disk drives used in server and consumer electronics applications  such as personal video recorders 
during the fourth quarter of  we shipped million suspension assemblies as some customers reduced their demand due to their excess suspension assembly inventory levels 
we expect demand to increase in the first quarter of as the excess inventory is worked off 
we anticipate shipments to range from million to million units for the first quarter of we continue to have limited visibility for future demand 
our selling prices are subject to market pressure from our competitors and pricing pressure from our customers 
in  our average selling prices declined as a result of planned price reductions triggered by higher volumes of certain suspension assemblies  as well as changes in the mix of products we sold 
in  our average selling prices increased as a result of ramp ups on new customer programs and a mix of products richer in value added features 
we anticipate that they will modestly increase in based upon a greater mix of products with finer electrical conductors and value added features  such as dual stage actuation  clad unamount arms  plated grounds  electrostatic protection measures  formed and polished headlifts  a variety of limiter configurations  dampers and laminated loadbeams 
our selling prices also are affected by changes in overall demand for our products  changes in the specific products our customers buy and a product s life cycle 
a typical life cycle for our products begins with higher pricing when products are introduced and decreasing prices as they mature 
to offset price decreases during a product s life  we rely primarily on higher sales volume and improving our manufacturing yields and efficiencies to reduce our cost 
if we cannot reduce our manufacturing costs as prices decline during our products life cycles  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we typically allow customers to change or cancel orders on short notice 
we plan our production and inventory based primarily on forecasts of customer demand  including forecasts of customer pulls of product out of our vendor managed inventory vmi facilities 
certain agreements with our customers provide that we maintain minimum finished goods inventory levels 
due to the higher demand we experienced during the first three quarters of  our finished goods inventory levels were low 
during the fourth quarter of  we were able to improve our finished goods inventory by 
table of contents building additional suspension assemblies beyond our customers immediate demand 
our customers often prefer a dual source supply and  therefore  may allocate their demand among suppliers 
both customer demand and the resulting forecasts often fluctuate substantially 
these factors  among others  create an environment where scheduled production and capacity utilization can vary significantly from week to week  leading to variability in gross margins and difficulty in estimating our position in the marketplace 
our gross margins have fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate based upon a variety of factors such as changes in demand or customer requirements  manufacturing yields or efficiencies  utilization of our production capacity  production and engineering costs associated with production of new products and features  product and feature mix  depreciation expense associated with adding production capacity  selling prices  infrastructure and expedited production and shipping costs  and costs of materials 
gross margins were in both and higher production efficiencies during the first half of were offset by lower production efficiencies resulting from a shift in product mix during the second half of the year toward advanced suspension assembly products that are typically more costly to produce in the ramp up to higher volume 
although we continue to have limited visibility for future demand  we expect our gross margin to range from to of net sales for the first quarter of our gross margins are typically better when customer demand is slightly below our full production capacity 
customer demand for particular products changes frequently  and when we run production at full capacity as we did in the first three quarters of  we may not be able to run each production unit long enough on a single product to reach peak production efficiency 
in addition  production inefficiencies often occur when we lose the flexibility to use excess capacity for tooling and equipment changes 
these inefficiencies at peak production capacity result in somewhat lower gross margins 
our suspension assembly business is capital intensive 
to meet expected demand growth  we plan to increase our equipment capacity from approximately million suspension assemblies per week at the beginning of to approximately million suspension assemblies per week by the end of the first quarter of in addition  we are expanding our manufacturing facility located in eau claire  wisconsin by approximately  square feet 
for  capital expenditures for the year totaled  we expect our capital expenditure to be approximately  in primarily for additions to manufacturing capacity  facilities  tooling and for development of new process technology 
we expect to fund these expenditures with cash generated from operations  our current cash  cash equivalents  securities available for sale and additional financing 
our operating results and gross margins have been  and will continue to be  favorably impacted by lower depreciation and lease expenses as a result of asset impairment charges in and totaling  and  respectively 
commencing in  consumption of suspension assemblies has exceeded the industry estimates for long term suspension assembly demand used in determining the impairment charges and a majority of the previously impaired assets have been placed back in service 
we estimate our annual savings in depreciation and lease costs due to these asset impairment charges were approximately  in and will total an aggregate of approximately  in additional savings in future years 
in  we significantly increased our research and development spending over the prior year to develop new process technologies for next generation products and equipment 
we spent  on research and development in compared to  in the disk drive industry is intensely competitive  and our customers operating results are dependent on being the first to market and first to volume with new products at a low cost 
our development efforts typically enable us to shorten development cycles and achieve high volume output per manufacturing unit more quickly than our competitors  and are an important factor in our success 
the next generation of smaller disk drives and next generation read write head sizes will require finer electrical conductors on the suspension assembly 
we are continuing to invest in extending the capabilities of our existing processes and adding associated capital equipment for manufacturing tsa suspension assemblies to meet escalating customer requirements for precision and performance 

table of contents we are developing an additive process and adding associated capital equipment for producing future generations of suspension assemblies  known as tsa suspension assemblies 
additive processing involves depositing a thin seed layer of metal onto a polyimide surface and then imaging and chemically plating up that seed layer to form the suspension s electrical conductors 
our ability to develop this process to accommodate further conductor miniaturization  and the rate at which our customers adopt smaller next generation read write heads  will largely determine the pace of our transition to an additive process and the volume of products we manufacture using the process 
we do not expect to begin volume production of tsa suspension assemblies during in the interim  if any of our customers require that the suspension assembly used in their products contain flexures manufactured through additive processing  we believe we will need to purchase these components from one of our competitors 
if our development of additive process capabilities is delayed for any reason or if suspension assemblies cannot be produced profitably in the quantities and to the specifications required by our customers  we also may need to purchase some components manufactured through additive processing from one of our competitors 
new manufacturing processes for advanced suspension assembly features and suspension assembly types  such as those currently under development  initially have lower manufacturing yields than those for more mature products and processes 
manufacturing yields generally improve as the process and product matures and production volumes increase 
manufacturing yields also vary depending on the complexity and uniqueness of products 
small variations in manufacturing yields can have a significant impact on gross margins 
we are in the process of implementing a new erp system throughout our company and have experienced some delays  extra costs and inefficiency 
we anticipate that  once implemented  this system will allow us to better manage our production capacity and respond more quickly to changes in demand 
we expect this implementation to be substantially complete during because erp systems are highly complex  implementation and the transition to the new system has been costly and may initially result in additional unexpected cost or difficulties  including failure or inefficient operation of the new system 
a failure in the new system could impair our ability to access certain business and financial information 
in addition  we may experience difficulties in the transition to our new erp system that could affect our internal control systems  processes and procedures 
we will continue to assess and mitigate these potential risks  however  should we experience such difficulties as a result of our new erp system  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in addition to increases in suspension assembly demand  improvements to our gross margins and operating margins will depend  in part  on the successful management of our corporate infrastructure and our suspension assembly production capacity 
our business is capital intensive and requires a high level of fixed costs 
our margins are sensitive to our level of fixed costs as well as changes in volume  product mix and capacity utilization 
as part of our efforts to improve our operating results  we may need to increase or decrease our overall employment level to meet customer requirements 
our overall employment level was  at the end of and has increased to  at the end of we increased the number of additional production workers supplied by temporary staffing agencies from at the end of to at the end of market trends we expect that the expanding use of enterprise computing and storage  desktop and mobile computers  increasingly complex software and the growth of new applications for disk storage  such as personal video recorders  audio players and digital cameras  together with emerging opportunities in cell phones  guidance systems for automobiles and other consumer electronics applications  will increase disk drive demand and  therefore  suspension assembly demand in the future 
we also believe demand for disk drives will continue to be subject  as it has in the past  to rapid or unforeseen changes resulting from  among other things  changes in disk drive inventory levels  technological advances  responses to competitive price changes and unpredicted high or low market acceptance of new drive models 
idc currently projects that disk drive shipments for calendar will increase by about compared with calendar in addition  we believe the average number of suspension assemblies used per disk drive has increased to approximately per drive in calendar compared to per drive in calendar increased demand for higher capacity drives  coupled with a slower rate of improvement in data density  tends to result in more disks  heads and suspension assemblies per disk drive 
the forecasted growth in calendar disk drive 
table of contents shipments and in suspension assemblies used per disk drive is expected to result in a worldwide calendar increase in suspension assembly shipments of about 
as in past years  disk drives continue to be the storage device of choice for applications requiring shorter access times and higher capacities because of their speed and low cost per gigabyte of stored data 
the cost of storing data on disk drives continues to decrease primarily due to increasing data density  thereby increasing storage capacity in disk drives  or reducing the number of components  including suspension assemblies  required in a disk drive 
the continual pursuit of increasing data density and lower storage costs is leading to suspension assemblies with finer electrical conductors and further adoption of value added features for suspension assemblies  such as clad unamount arms  plated grounds  electrostatic protection measures  formed and polished headlifts  a variety of limiter configurations  dampers and laminated loadbeams 
our suspension assemblies also allow for dual stage actuation  which incorporates a second stage actuator on the suspension to improve head positioning over increasingly tighter data tracks 
the miniaturization of disk drives  the development of smaller read write heads  continuing improvement in data density and the increasing use of disk drives in consumer electronics applications will require even finer electrical conductors on the suspension assembly 
newer disk drives also may require additional electrical conductors 
our current tsa suspensions are produced using a subtractive process  and we are investing in extending our current process capabilities and in developing a new additive process and equipment to meet emerging industry specifications 
while we do not expect to generate revenue from suspension assemblies produced utilizing additive processes in  we will invest significantly in developing this capability and related capital equipment 
the introduction of new types or sizes of read write heads and disk drives tends to initially decrease our customers yields with the result that we may experience temporary elevations of demand for some types of suspension assemblies 
we believe reduced yields at some of our customers due to their transition to higher density recording heads resulted in increased shipments of our suspension assemblies in and the first half of as programs mature  higher customer yields decrease the demand for suspension assemblies 
the advent of new heads and new drive designs may require rapid development and implementation of new suspension assembly types which temporarily may increase our development spending and reduce our manufacturing yields and efficiencies 
these changes will continue to affect us

the increase in 
table of contents suspension assembly unit shipments was due to an increase in disk drive shipments year over year  an increase in the average number of suspension assemblies used per disk drive and our share positions on types of disk drives in particularly high demand 
the increase in average selling prices for suspension assemblies was the result of product mix changes 
sales of suspension assembly components to other suspension assembly manufacturers decreased  or  compared to gross profit for was  compared to  for the increase primarily was due to the increase in net sales discussed above 
gross profit as a percent of net sales was in both and higher production efficiencies during the first half of the year were offset by lower production efficiencies resulting from a shift in product mix during the second half of the year toward advanced suspension assembly products that are typically more costly to produce in the ramp up to higher volume 
research and development expenses for were  compared to  for the increased research and development expenses primarily were due to a  increase in labor expenses resulting from hiring additional personnel to support increased customer specific suspension assembly development efforts and to develop process technologies for next generation products  a  increase in expenses for our biomeasurement division  primarily for clinical studies  and  in higher supply expenses 
research and development expenses as a percent of net sales were in both and selling  general and administrative expenses for were  compared to  for the increased selling  general and administrative expenses primarily were attributable to  in higher labor expenses   in higher incentive compensation expenses   in higher supply expenses   in higher travel and training expenses and  in higher professional services expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales decreased from in to in income from operations for was  compared to  for the increase primarily was due to the increase in net sales discussed above  partially offset by the increased research and development expenses and selling and general administrative expenses discussed above 
income from operations for included a  loss from operations for our biomeasurement division segment  compared to a  loss for interest income for was  an increase of  from this primarily was a result of higher investment yields  interest received on a tax refund noted below and a loss on the sale of certain securities during other income  net of other expenses  for was  an increase of  from  primarily due to increased royalty income 
interest expense for was  a decrease of  from  primarily due to an increase in the amount of interest expense capitalized as capital expenditures increased in the income tax provisions for and resulted in estimated annual effective tax rates of and  respectively 
the annual effective tax rate excludes the tax refund noted below and related tax contingency reserve adjustments 
the annual effective tax rate excludes the release of a valuation allowance discussed below and under critical accounting policies income taxes 
these rates are below the statutory federal rate primarily due to our estimate of the benefit derived from the foreign sales corporation fsc repeal and extraterritorial income exclusion act of eie provisions related to export of us products 
during the third quarter of  based on a court decision  we were awarded a refund  with interest  of certain minnesota corporate income taxes paid for the years through as a result of the court s decision  we also reversed a related tax contingency reserve 
these items were partially offset by an adjustment to the carrying value of future tax benefits on certain net operating loss nol carryforwards 
these items resulted in a net income tax benefit of  for we were also awarded a refund  with interest  of certain minnesota corporate income taxes paid for the years through during  we reduced  of the valuation allowance related to the future tax benefits of nol carryforwards  resulting in a net income tax benefit of  for and an increase to shareholders equity of  related to the exercise of certain unqualified or early disposition of certain qualified stock options by employees 
based on our taxable income in prior years  our operating results and our estimates of future taxable income  we concluded that it was more likely than not that a significant portion of our nol carryforwards would be realized

operations to operations net sales for were  a decrease of  or  compared to suspension assembly sales decreased  or  compared to  primarily as a result of a decline in average selling prices for suspension assemblies partially offset by a increase in suspension assembly unit shipments 
the decline in average selling prices for suspension assemblies was the result of product mix changes and typical price reductions as products mature over increasingly longer product lives 
the increase in suspension assembly unit shipments was due to an increase in disk drive shipments year over year 
additionally  sales of suspension assembly components to other suspension assembly manufacturers decreased  or  compared to gross profit for was  compared to  for the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in net sales discussed above

table of contents during  based on our review of various factors  including historical taxable income  our operating results and our estimates of future taxable income  we concluded that it was more likely than not that a significant portion of our nol and credit carryforwards would be realized 
as a result  we reduced  of the valuation allowance related to the future tax benefits of nol and credit carryforwards  resulting in a net income tax benefit of  for and an increase to shareholders equity of  related to the exercise of certain unqualified or early disposition of certain qualified stock options by employees 
net income was  or of net sales for  compared to net income of  or of net sales for net income for included the above mentioned  tax adjustment  and net income for included the above mentioned  pre tax loss on debt extinguishment 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents  securities available for sale  cash flow from operations and additional financing capacity 
our cash and cash equivalents remained relatively flat at  at september  and  at september  our securities available for sale decreased from  to  during the same period 
overall  this reflects a  decrease in our cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale  primarily due to capital expenditures of  offset by  generated from operations 
on january   we entered into a loan agreement with lasalle bank national association  establishing a  unsecured credit facility 
as of september   we had no outstanding loans under this facility 
letters of credit outstanding under this facility totaled approximately  as of such date  resulting in approximately  of remaining availability 
cash used for capital expenditures totaled  for compared to  in and  in the capital expenditures during were primarily for both tsa suspension and tsa suspension production capacity  process technology and capability improvements  new program tooling  new business systems and facility construction 
we anticipate capital expenditures to be approximately  in primarily for both tsa suspension and tsa suspension manufacturing capacity  facilities and tooling  and for the development of new process technology 
financing of these capital expenditures will be principally from internally generated funds  cash and cash equivalents  securities available for sale  our credit facility and new financing 
on july   our board of directors approved an expansion of our manufacturing facility located in eau claire  wisconsin 
we plan to add up to  square feet to our manufacturing facility and expect the expansion to cost between  and  we currently expect to complete this expansion in july in july  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to two million shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions  subject to market conditions  share price and other factors 
in  we repurchased a total of  shares for a total cost of  the average price paid per share was 
in  we repurchased a total of  shares for a total cost of  the average price paid per share was 
we may still repurchase up to  shares under this program 
certain of our existing financing agreements contain financial covenants as well as covenants which  among other things  restrict our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders and restrict our ability to enter into certain types of financing 
as of september   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
if  however  we are not in compliance with the covenants in our financing agreements at the end of any future quarter and cannot obtain amendments on terms acceptable to us  our future financial results and liquidity could be materially adversely affected 
we currently believe that our cash and cash equivalents  securities available for sale  cash generated from operations  our credit facility and additional financing will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses  debt service requirements and capital expenditures through our ability to obtain additional financing will depend upon a number of factors  including our future performance and financial results and general economic and capital market conditions 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to raise additional capital on reasonable terms or at all  if needed 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table presents our contractual obligations at september  in thousands payments due by period less than one to three to more than total one year three years five years five years long term debt interest expense operating leases total at september   we were not party to any significant purchase obligations for goods or services 
off balance sheet arrangements on january   we entered into a loan agreement with lasalle bank national association  establishing a  unsecured credit facility 
as of september   we had no outstanding loans under this facility 
letters of credit outstanding under this facility totaled approximately  as of such date  resulting in approximately  of remaining availability 
we currently have no unconsolidated special purpose entity arrangements 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
following are our most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and involve judgment and estimates 
if these estimates differ materially from actual results  the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material 
revenue recognition in recognizing revenue in any period  we apply the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling costs associated with products sold are classified as revenue 
for all sales  we use a binding purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 
delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier 
certain of our products are delivered on an fob destination basis 
we defer our revenue associated with these transactions until the delivery has occurred to the customers premises 
we also store inventory in warehouses vendor managed inventory vmi facilities that are located close to certain of our customer s manufacturing facilities 
revenue is recognized on sales from vmi facilities upon the transfer of title and risk of loss  following the customer s acknowledgement of the receipt of the goods 
we also enter into reimbursement arrangements with customers that provide for reimbursement of guaranteed capacity 
we recognize the associated revenue over the estimated life of the program for which the capacity is guaranteed 
accounts receivable we are dependent on a limited number of customers  and as a result  our trade accounts receivable is highly concentrated 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of uncollectability based on past transaction history with the customer and the customer s financial condition 
while we perform ongoing credit reviews of our customers and have established an allowance for doubtful accounts  a significant deterioration in the financial condition of any significant customer may result in additional charges to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts or to write off certain accounts 

table of contents we record a provision against revenue for estimated sales returns on sales of our products in the same period that the related revenues are recognized 
we base the allowance on historical returns as well as existing product return authorizations 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market by analyzing market conditions  current sales prices  inventory costs and inventory balances 
we are dependent on a limited number of customers and a limited number of product programs for each customer 
because our products are custom built  we typically cannot shift work in process or finished goods from customer to customer  or from one program to another for a particular customer 
we evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing backlog  estimated demand  inventory on hand  sales levels and other information 
we write down excess and obsolete inventory to the lower of cost or market based on the analysis 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a prolonged industry downturn or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  the assets will be written down based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
fair value would generally be determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows 
changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the assessment of long lived assets 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change this allowance in a period  we must include an expense or a benefit within the tax provision in our statement of operations 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
at september  we had a valuation allowance of  due to the uncertainty of realizing the benefits of certain tax credits and nol carryforwards before they expire 
the valuation allowance was based on our historical taxable income and our estimates of future taxable income in each jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
at june   based on our continued review of various factors  including our recent historical taxable income  year to date operating results and our estimates of future taxable income  we determined that it was more likely than not that a significant portion of these deferred tax assets would be realized 
accordingly  the valuation allowance was reduced by  resulting in a net income tax benefit of  for and an increase to shareholders equity of  which relates to the exercise and or sale of stock options by employees 
at september  and september   we had a remaining valuation allowance of  and  respectively  related primarily to certain tax credits and the uncertainty of realizing these benefits before they expire due to certain limitations 
we will continue to assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realizable and the valuation allowance will be adjusted accordingly  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
other matters we are involved in certain legal matters which may result in additional future cash requirements 
see the discussion of these matters in note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we are subject to certain recent accounting pronouncements 
see the discussion of these matters in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the american jobs creation act of ajca was signed into law on october  the ajca contained two provisions that affect us 
the first provision is the repeal of the eie provisions  which will be phased out on a calendar year basis with the benefit ending december  due to the new law  it is expected that we will have a decreased benefit from eie 
the second provision is the introduction of a deduction for a percentage of income from domestic production activities 
the deduction is phased in on a taxable year basis with the benefit beginning for us with the tax year for our fiscal year ending september  and being fully phased in with the tax year for our fiscal year ending september  there will be no impact to us from this new deduction in  and the benefit starting in fiscal is expected to offset some of the lost eie benefit inflation management believes inflation has not had a material effect on our operations or on our financial condition
