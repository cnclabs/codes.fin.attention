overview during the past year  si international experienced growth in our four key focus areas defense transformation  homeland defense  federal it modernization  and mission critical outsourcing 
in terms of customer concentration  the department of defense has continued to grow more rapidly than other customers 
this can be attributed to two primary factors that have yielded an overall increase in spending by the department of defense during fiscal year the dod budget was approved well before its civilian budget counterparts  and the push for defense transformation has resulted in mission critical work  the completion of which is considered imperative by the federal government 
the early approval of the dod budget was a catalyst for early adoption of defense appropriation legislation and a smooth allocation of the associated funding 
this process has allowed our customers to effectively execute their it and network solution plans 
this pattern has occurred in each of the past two years and appears to be a trend that will continue for the next three to five years 
virtually all of the dod efforts in which si international is engaged either directly support or are closely related to dod transformation goals 
however  we will continue to segment our focus areas in terms of homeland defense  federal it modernization  mission critical outsourcing  and defense transformation 
it is important that we reflect our customer s evolving priorities through our characterization of the programs in each focus area 
we are  first and foremost  a provider of information technology and network solutions to the federal government 
our clients include the us air force space command  us army  the department of state  the department of homeland security  and the defense intelligence community 
the addition of matcom has allowed us to continue to support our existing customer base  while strengthening our position with the us army  us navy  us air force electronic systems center  and us department of agriculture  and opening new client relationships with the federal retirement thrift investment board  and national institutes of health 
we combine our technology and industry expertise to provide a full spectrum of state of the practice solutions and services  from design and development to implementation and operations  which assist our clients in achieving mission success 
because we acquired bridge technology on december   the acquisition had a negligible effect on the company s fiscal results 
going forward  we expect that the addition of bridge technology  and the more recent acquisition of sei  which closed on february   will have a significant impact on si international as we continue to focus on the high growth areas within the federal government 
the establishment of a director of national intelligence and the focus on the war on terror  place increasing demands on the contractor community to support our country s national intelligence assets 
our mission aligns closely with the mission of the department of homeland security  for which the president has proposed a budget increase of over to meet the vital needs of this department 
bridge technology brings a focus on the defense intelligence agencies that will provide us with a vantage point from which we can grow our intelligence business as we better support our customers growing requirements 
we believe that sei will provide a stronger base of business supporting homeland security in areas that will benefit from the increased government spending 
in fiscal and fiscal  we received and  respectively  of our revenues from services we provided to various departments and agencies of the federal government  both directly and through other prime contractors  and and  respectively  of our total revenues from work performed for commercial entities 
the following table shows our revenues from the client groups listed as a percentage of total revenue 
revenue data for the department of defense includes revenue generated from work performed under engagements for both the department of defense and the intelligence community 
fiscal year department of defense federal civilian agencies commercial entities total revenue while a substantial percentage of the revenues of bridge technology are attributable to the department of defense or defense intelligence agencies  a far larger percentage of the revenues of sei are attributable to the federal civilian agencies 
as a result and based upon the size of sei relative to bridge technology  we believe that the percentage of our revenues attributable to the department of defense should decrease  the percentage of our revenue attributable to federal civilian agencies should increase  and the percentage of our revenue attributable to commercial entities  including international operations  should decrease marginally 
we have derived a substantial majority of our revenues from governmental contracts under which we act as a prime contractor 
we also provide services indirectly as a subcontractor 
the following table shows our revenues as prime contractor and as subcontractor as a percentage of our total revenue for the following periods fiscal year prime contract revenue subcontract revenue total revenue as a result of the acquisition of bridge technologies and sei  we believe the percentage of our prime contract revenue may decrease 
our services are provided under three types of contracts cost reimbursable  time and materials and fixed price contracts 
the following table shows our revenues from each of these types of contracts as a percentage of our total revenue for the following periods fiscal year cost reimbursable time and materials fixed price total as a result of the acquisition of bridge technology and sei  we anticipate that during fiscal year that the percentage of our revenue attributable to time and materials contracts may increase marginally  that the percentage of our revenue attributable to fixed price contracts may increase meaningfully  and that the percentage of our revenue attributable to cost reimbursable contracts may decrease meaningfully 
under cost reimbursable contracts  we are reimbursed for costs that are determined to be reasonable  allowable and allocable to the contract  and paid a fee representing the profit margin negotiated between us and the contracting agency  which may be fixed or performance based 
under cost reimbursable contracts we recognize revenues and an estimate of applicable fees earned as costs are incurred 
we consider fixed fees under cost reimbursable contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract 
for performance based fees under cost reimbursable contracts  we recognize the relevant portion of the expected fee to be awarded by the client at the time such fee can be reasonably estimated  based on factors such as our prior award experience and communications with the client regarding performance 
in general  cost reimbursable contracts are the least profitable of our government contracts 
under time and materials contracts  we are reimbursed for labor at fixed hourly rates and generally reimbursed separately for allowable materials  costs and expenses 
to the extent that our actual labor costs under a time and materials contract are higher or lower than the billing rates under the contract  our profit under the contract may either be greater or less than we anticipated or we may suffer a loss under the contract 
we recognize revenues under time and materials contracts by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended by the contract billing rates and adding the effect of other billable direct costs 
in general  we realize a higher profit margin on work performed under time and materials contracts than cost reimbursable contracts 
under fixed price contracts  we perform specific tasks for a fixed price 
compared to cost reimbursable and time and materials contracts  fixed price contracts generally offer higher profit margin opportunities but involve greater financial risk because we bear the impact of cost overruns in return for the full benefit of any cost savings 
we generally do not undertake complex  high risk work  such as long term software development  under fixed price terms 
fixed price contracts may include either a product delivery or specific service performance over a defined period 
revenue on fixed price contracts that provide for the company to render services throughout a period is recognized as earned according to contract terms as the service is provided on a proportionate performance basis 
while a substantial number of these contracts are generally less than six months in duration  we have several multi year contracts of this type in which the customer has the option to extend the contractual term beyond the current term 
if we anticipate a loss on a contract  we provide for the full amount of anticipated loss at the time of that determination 
our most significant expense is direct cost  which consists primarily of direct labor costs for program personnel and direct expenses incurred to complete contracts  including cost of materials and subcontract efforts 
our ability to predict accurately the number and types of personnel  their salaries  and other costs  can have a significant impact on our direct cost 
the allowability of certain direct and indirect costs in federal contracts is subject to audit by the client  usually through the dcaa 
certain indirect costs are charged to contracts and paid by the client using provisional  or estimated  indirect rates  which are subject to later revision  based on the government audits of those costs 
approximately of our revenue recognized during fiscal was derived from contracts that we expect will become subject to competitive bids prior to the end of government fiscal as a result of the acquisition of bridge technology and sei  we believe the percentage of our revenue subject to competitive bids prior to the end of the government fiscal year will increase 
we actively monitor our relationships with our clients during our engagements  as well as the quality of the service we provide  to assist in our efforts to win recompetition bids 
in addition  we strive to maintain good relationships with a wide variety of government contractors 
recent events on february   we completed the purchase of sei 
sei is a provider of critical business process outsourcing primarily for the department of homeland security 
sei s services include data and records management  applications processing  file and mail management  analytical support services  and secure optical card processing at one of the largest facilities of its kind 
under the terms of the definitive stock purchase agreement  we acquired sei for million in cash  subject to certain adjustments relating to the level of working capital

in connection with our acquisition of sei  we borrowed million in long term debt which will be repaid in twenty three consecutive quarterly payments of  each  starting from june  through december   and a final payment of million on february  critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting policies related to revenue recognition to be critical to the understanding of our results of operations 
our critical accounting policies also include the areas where we have made what we consider to be particularly difficult  subjective or complex judgments in making estimates  and where these estimates can significantly impact our financial results under different assumptions and conditions 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results could be different from these estimates 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue under its contracts when a contract has been executed  the contract price is fixed and determinable  delivery of services or products has occurred  and collectibility of the contract price is considered probable and can be reasonably estimated 
revenue is earned under cost reimbursable  time and materials and fixed price contracts 
direct contract costs are expensed as incurred 
under cost reimbursable contracts  the company is reimbursed for allowable costs  and paid a fee  which may be fixed or performance based 
revenues on cost reimbursable contracts are recognized as costs are incurred plus an estimate of applicable fees earned 
the company considers fixed fees under cost reimbursable contracts to be earned in proportion of the allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract 
for cost reimbursable contracts that include performance based fee incentives  the company recognizes the relevant portion of the expected fee to be awarded by the customer at the time such fee can be reasonably estimated  based on factors such as the company s prior award experience and communications with the customer regarding performance 
revenue on time and materials contracts are recognized based on direct labor hours expended at contract billing rates and adding other billable direct costs 
fixed price contracts may include either a product delivery or specific service performance throughout a period 
for fixed price contracts that are based on unit pricing  the company recognizes revenue for the number of units delivered in any given fiscal period 
for fixed price contracts that are based on the proportionate performance method and involve a specified number of similar acts  the company recognizes revenue based on the proportion of those acts completed compared to the number of total specified acts required by the contract 
for fixed price contracts that are based on the proportionate performance method and involve a specified number of defined but not similar acts  the company recognizes revenue based on the proportion of the project s percentage total costs incurred compared to the estimated total costs associated with the entire transaction 
for fixed price contracts that provide for the delivery of a specific product with related customer acceptance provisions  revenues and associated contract costs are recognized upon product delivery and customer acceptance 
the company s contracts with agencies of the government are subject to periodic funding by the respective contracting agency 
funding for a contract may be provided in full at inception of the contract or ratably throughout the contract as the services are provided 
in evaluating the probability of funding for purposes of assessing collectibility of the contract price  the company considers its previous experiences with its customers  communications with its customers regarding funding status  and the company s knowledge of available funding for the contract or program 
if funding is not assessed as probable  revenue recognition is deferred until realization is deemed probable 
contract revenue recognition inherently involves estimation  including the contemplated level of effort to accomplish the tasks under contract  the cost of the effort  and an ongoing assessment of progress toward completing the contract 
from time to time  as part of the normal management processes  facts develop that require revisions to estimated total costs or revenues expected 
the cumulative impact of any revisions to estimates and the full impact of anticipated losses on any type of contract are recognized in the period in which they become known 
the allowability of certain costs under government contracts is subject to audit by the government 
certain indirect costs are charged to contracts using provisional or estimated indirect rates  which are subject to later revision based on government audits of those costs 
management is of the opinion that costs subsequently disallowed  if any  would not be significant 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb opinion no 
and related interpretations 
accordingly  compensation expense for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the fair market value of the company s stock at the date of the grant over the exercise price of the related option 
we have adopted the annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
in our financial reports for the year ended december  the disclosures determine compensation cost for the company s stock options based on sfas no 
 which reflects the fair value of each option estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
r revised  share based payment 
statement r addressesthe accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
statement r requires an entity to recognize the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees in the income statement 
the revised statement generally requires that an entity account for those transactions using the fair value based method  and eliminates the intrinsic value method of accounting in apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  which was permitted under statement  as originally issued 
the revised statement requires entities to disclose information about the nature of the share based payment transactions and the effects of those transactions on the financial statements 
statement r is effective for the company after june  all public companies must use either the modified prospective or the modified retrospective transition method 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this pronouncement  which must be adopted in the third quarter of fiscal year item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk historically  our investment positions have been relatively small and short term in nature 
we have typically made investments in a fund with an effective average maturity of fewer than days having a portfolio make up consisting primarily of commercial paper and notes and variable rate instruments  and to a much smaller extent overnight securities and bank instruments 
since our initial public offering  the board of directors approved an investment policy that requires we invest in relatively short term  high quality  and high liquidity obligations
