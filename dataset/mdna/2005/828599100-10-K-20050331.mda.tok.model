item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and overview in  we experienced a strong year on year sales increase and improved earnings significantly from during this period  we continued to focus on the following key priorities expanding our customer base through our alliance with simclar group  seeking to develop strong  long term alliances with major growth oems  and developing the opportunities arising from our acquisition of simclar mexico in july during  we continued to see new business awards from existing and new customers 
as discussed in more detail throughout this item o our revenues increased by during compared to  following sales growth in compared to  o gross margin in increased by approximately  compared to  primarily due to sales growth  o we continued to leverage selling  general and administrative expenses and reduced these to of sales in from in o net income of approximately  in substantially exceeded net income of approximately  in  o cash flows used in investing activities were approximately  in  mainly for earn out consideration in connection with the acquisition of simclar mexico  the purchase of the land and building occupied by our dayton  ohio plant and purchases of machinery and equipment for our new manufacturing facility in mexico  and o increased bank borrowing facilities of  were negotiated in with bank of scotland to fund our investing activities and the increased working capital requirements resulting from the increase in sales in the year 
our operations have continued to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue 
significant reductions in sales to any of our large customers would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the level and timing of orders placed by a customer vary due to the customer s attempts to balance its inventory  design modifications  changes in a customer s manufacturing strategy  acquisitions of or consolidations among customers  and variation in demand for a customer s products due to  among other things  product life cycles  competitive conditions and general economic conditions 
termination of manufacturing relationships or changes  reductions or delays in orders could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  as has occurred in the past 
our results also depend to a substantial extent on the success of our oem customers in marketing their products 
we continue to seek to diversify our customer base to reduce our reliance on our few major customers 
see business strategy and customers under item  business 
the industry segments we serve  and the electronics industry as a whole  are subject to rapid technological change and product obsolescence 
discontinuance or modification of products containing components manufactured by our company could adversely affect our results of operations 
the electronics industry is also subject to economic cycles and has in the past experienced  and is likely in the future to experience  recessionary periods 
a prolonged worldwide recession in the electronics industry  as we experienced from through  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
during periods of recession in the electronics industry  our competitive advantages in the areas of quick turnaround manufacturing and responsive customer service may be of reduced importance to electronic oems  who may become more price sensitive 
we typically do not obtain long term volume purchase contracts from our customers  but rather we work with our customers to anticipate future volumes of orders 
based upon such anticipated future orders  we will make commitments regarding the level of business we want and can accomplish given the current timing of production schedules and the levels of and utilization of facilities and personnel 
occasionally  we purchase raw materials without a customer order or commitment 
customers may cancel  delay or reduce orders  usually without penalty  for a variety of reasons  whether relating to the customer or the industry in general  which orders are already made or anticipated 
any significant cancellations  reductions or order delays could adversely affect our results of operations 
we use electronic data interchange edi with both our customers and our suppliers in our efforts to continuously develop accurate forecasts of customer volume requirements  as well as sharing our future requirements with our suppliers 
we depend on the timely availability of many components 
component shortages could result in manufacturing and shipping delays or increased component prices  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
it is important for us to efficiently manage inventory  proper timing of expenditures and allocations of physical and personnel resources in anticipation of future sales  the evaluation of economic conditions in the electronics industry and the mix of products  whether pcbs  wire harnesses  cables  or turnkey products  for manufacture 
see electronic manufacturing industry and supplies and materials management under item  business and results of operations below 
we must continuously develop improved manufacturing procedures to accommodate our customers needs for increasingly complex products 
to continue to grow and be a successful competitor  we must be able to maintain and enhance our technological capabilities  develop and market manufacturing services which meet changing customer needs and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost effective and timely basis 
although we believe that our operations utilize the assembly and testing technologies and equipment currently required by our customers  there can be no assurance that our process development efforts will be successful or that the emergence of new technologies  industry standards or customer requirements will not render our technology  equipment or processes obsolete or noncompetitive 
in addition  to the extent that we determine that new assembly and testing technologies and equipment are required to remain competitive  the acquisition and implementation of such technologies and equipment are likely to require significant capital investment 
our results of operations are also affected by other factors  including price competition  the level and timing of customer orders  fluctuations in material costs due to availability  the overhead efficiencies achieved by management in managing the costs of our operations  our experience in manufacturing a particular product  the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased orders  selling  and general and administrative expenses 
accordingly  gross margins and operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high volume and high capacity utilization 
we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating margins during periods of lower volume production 
key financial performance measures we manage and assess the performance of our business primarily through the following measures orders booked and backlog the ratio of orders booked to sales is reviewed on a monthly basis for each of the company s five manufacturing plants 
sales monthly sales for each plant are compared against budget and the same month in the previous year 
gross margin the gross margin achieved by each plant each month is compared against budget and the same month in the previous year 
selling  general and administrative expenses the ratio of these expenses as a percentage of sales for each plant each month is compared against budget 
working capital movements in the balance sheet amounts of inventory  accounts receivable and accounts payable for each plant are reviewed on a monthly basis 
bank borrowings movements in the company s working capital facility with the bank are reviewed on a weekly basis 
in the event that any of the above measures indicate unusual movements or trends  further review is undertaken by management to ensure that satisfactory explanations are obtained  and  where necessary  appropriate corrective action is taken 
results of operations the following is a discussion of the key factors that have affected our business over the last three years 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related footnotes included herein 
compared to consolidated revenues increased approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year 
the acquisition of simclar mexico in july generated  of the increase in sales in continual improvements in our sales to the computer peripherals  instrumentation  power equipment  telecommunications and food preparation equipment industries provided the additional  of increased sales in  compared to the preceding year 
only our sales to the military government sector declined in  when compared to our best sales improvements in were in our sales to computer peripherals industry of  and to the instrumentation industry of  interest and other income decreased approximately  in the year ended december   compared to the preceding year 
the decrease was due to gain on the disposition of a building in scotland in the year ending december  approximately of our consolidated sales for were made to five customers 
illinois tool works itw is the only customer that accounts for more than of our total sales 
the loss of or substantial reduction of sales to any major customer would have an adverse effect on our operations if such sales were not replaced 
see item  business customers 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales amounted to for the year ended december  and for the preceding year 
the company experienced higher material costs as a percentage of sales  at percent of sales for the products manufactured in  compared to in the preceding year 
the higher material cost was due to price increases from suppliers of electronic components and higher cost bills of materials for certain products manufactured in the second half of the year 
the labor content of our manufactured products remained steady at of sales for and for the overhead component of cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales was in  compared to in the preceding year 
this was due mainly to the higher volume production in our four us manufacturing locations in selling  general and administrative expenses increased by approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year  and amounted to approximately and of sales for and  respectively 
the acquisition of simclar mexico in july contributed approximately  of the increase in compared to increased employee costs were the primary drivers of the remaining expense increase in compared to interest expense decreased approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year  reflecting the decreased borrowings until october when we restructure our credit facilities to acquire the land and building of our dayton  ohio facility  which we formerly had leased 
the three month libor was and at december  and  respectively 
compared to consolidated revenues increased approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year 
the acquisition of simclar mexico in july generated  of increased sales 
improvements in the computer peripherals and telecommunication industries provided an increase in sales of  in over soft demand in the food preparation industry decreased sales by  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  interest and other income increased approximately  primarily due to the gain on the disposition of a building in scotland in the year ended december   compared to the preceding year 
approximately of our consolidated sales for were made to five customers 
illinois tool works itw was the only customer that accounted for more than of our total sales in cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales amounted to for the year ended december   and for the preceding year 
the increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales was attributable to the slightly higher cost structure of our matamoros  mexico facility 
at the remaining four manufacturing locations  cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales remained the same at for the years ended december  and selling  general and administrative expenses increased by approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year  and amounted to approximately of sales for and  respectively 
the increase in was due primarily to the cost added with the acquisition of simclar mexico in july we recorded a one time charge of approximately  in related to the write off of the accumulated foreign currency transaction account due to the substantial liquidation of our wholly owned subsidiary  techdyne europe in the fourth quarter of interest expense decreased approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year  reflecting the decreased borrowings due to our profitable operations  along with declining interest rates during the year 
the three month libor was and at december  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents balances at december  were approximately  compared to approximately  at december  net cash provided by operating activities was approximately  in compared to approximately  in the increase in cash provided from operating activities in as compared to was due primarily to an increase in net income in compared to with a slight offset due to increased working capital to support our increase in sales in over at december   our average outstanding sales days was days as compared to days at december  the increase in our average outstanding sales days is primarily the result of the nature of the customer base that we are servicing from our mexican facilities 
the overall trend we experienced over the last two years is that the majority of our customers are stretching out payment terms 
average inventory turnover was and times for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in inventory turnover is primarily due to our increased sales in across all of the industries that we service  with the exception of the military government sector 
cash flows used in investing activities were approximately  in as compared to approximately  in cash used in investing activities was primarily for additional consideration paid as an earn out in connection with the acquisition of simclar mexico  the purchase of the land and building occupied by our manufacturing operation in dayton  ohio  and purchases of machinery and equipment for our new manufacturing facility in mexico 
we have a capital expenditure budget of  for cash flow provided from financing activities was approximately  in as compared to cash flow used in of approximately  the cash flow provided was from the restructuring of our two credit facilities with the bank of scotland as discussed below 
on october   the company entered into two credit facilities with bank of scotland in edinburgh  scotland for an aggregate borrowing of  the financing included a  line of credit  with an interest rate at libor plus for a one  three or six month period  at the company s election 
the financing also included a seven year term loan of  at the same interest rate as the line of credit 
the term loan specified quarterly payments of  due in january  april  july and october of each year 
on october   the company restructured its existing term loan and working capital facilities with the bank 
the term loan was made pursuant to an amended and restated facility letter providing for a term loan of  of which tranche a represents outstanding borrowings of  and tranche b represents the  loan to acquire the property located at stanley avenue  dayton  ohio 
the principal of tranche a is repayable in quarterly installments of  in january  april  july and october of each year from through  with the final payment due in october the principal of tranche b is payable in twenty eight equal quarterly installments of  with the first installment payable on january  interest on each advance accrues at an annual rate equal to libor plus  plus an amount  rounded to the nearest eighth of a percent  to cover any increases in certain regulatory costs incurred by the bank 
the company may elect to pay interest on advances every one  three or six months  with libor adjusted to correspond to the interest payment period selected by the company 
the company elected the three month interest period at until january  after this date the rate is until april  the term loan had an outstanding balance of  at december  the company s existing working capital facility with the bank was also amended on october  to increase the amount of the facility from  to  advances bear interest  and interest is payable  on the same terms as under the amended term loan facility 
this line of credit had an outstanding balance of  at december   and expires on september  the company intends to renew this credit facility prior to its expiration date 
all of the assets of the company collateralize the credit facilities 
the credit facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants 
certain of the affirmative covenants require maintenance of a consolidated adjusted net worth greater than  a ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated net borrowing not less than to  a ratio of consolidated trade receivables to consolidated net borrowings not less than 
to  and a ratio of consolidated net income before interest and income taxes to total consolidated interest costs not less than to some of the negative covenants  among others  include granting or permitting a security agreement against the consolidated assets of the companies other than permitted security agreements  declaring or paying any dividends or making any other payments on the company s capital stock  consolidating or merging with any other entity or acquiring or purchasing any equity interest in any other entity  or assuming any obligations of any other entity  except for notes and receivables acquired in the ordinary course of business  incurring  assuming  guarantying  or remaining liable with respect to any indebtedness  except for certain existing indebtedness disclosed in these financial statements  or undertaking any capital expenditure in excess of  in any one fiscal year 
the agreements also preclude  without the bank s prior written consent  changes in ownership in the companies  any mergers or acquisitions  any material change in any of our business objectives  purposes  operations and tax residence or any other circumstances or events which will have a material adverse effect as defined by the agreements 
the bank consented to the simclar mexico acquisition in our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by changes in our business condition or results of our operations  or other events beyond our control 
the breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under our debt agreements 
at december   the company was not in compliance with one of these covenants as a result of having capital expenditures for the year in excess of the  limit specified in the covenant 
however  we obtained from the bank a waiver of the non compliance  and we believe that we will remain in compliance with our covenants for the remainder of  but there can be no assurance that defaults in any of the covenants will not occur in the future  nor can there be any assurance that our lender will waive future covenant violations 
a default of the covenants would permit our lender to accelerate the maturity of our credit facilities and to sell the assets securing them  which would cause us to cease operations and seek bankruptcy protection 
on october   techdyne europe entered into a credit facility with bank of scotland for an amount of pound  
this facility comprised an eight year term loan repayable in quarterly payments of pound   due in january  april  july and october of each year  with an interest rate of bank of scotland base rate plus effectively at december  
this term loan in the amount of pound  was paid off on september  we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements with related or unrelated parties and no unconsolidated subsidiaries 
in the normal course of business  we enter into various contractual and other commercial commitments that impact or can impact the liquidity of our operations 
the following table outlines our commitments at december  total less than over in thousands amounts year years years years long term debt with interest     operating leases non cancelable     bank line of credit with interest   vendor open line of credit   total commitments      effect of recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which would require all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values  effective for public companies for interim periods beginning after june  sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using either the modified prospective or retrospective method 
the company will adopt this statement in the third quarter of fiscal year and currently does not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  and cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter inventory pricing 
sfas no 
requires idle facility costs  abnormal freight  handling costs  and amounts of wasted materials spoilage be treated as current period costs 
under this concept  if the costs associated with the actual level of spoilage or production defects are greater than the costs associated with the range of normal spoilage or defects  the difference would be charged to current period expense  not included in inventory costs 
sfas no 
also requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we will adopt this statement for fiscal year and currently do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  and cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
the amendments made by sfas no 
are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in apb opinion no 
provided an exception to this basic measurement principle for exchanges of similar productive assets 
that exception required that some nonmonetary exchanges be recorded on a carryover basis 
sfas no 
eliminates this exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
an exchange would lack commercial substance if our future cash flows are not expected to change significantly as a result of that exchange 
sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  earlier application is permitted 
we will adopt this new standard for fiscal year and do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  and cash flows 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
based on historical information  we believe that our allowance is adequate 
however  changes in general economic  business and market conditions could affect the ability of customers to make their required payments  therefore  the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed monthly and changes to the allowance are updated as new information is received 
allowance for inventory obsolescence we maintain an allowance for inventory obsolescence for losses resulting from inventory items becoming unusable in the manufacturing operations due to loss of a specific customer or a customer s product changes or discontinuations 
based on historical and projected sales information and concentration of customers  we believe that the allowance is adequate 
however  changes in general economic  business and market conditions could cause customers to cancel  reduce or reschedule orders 
these changes could affect the company inventory turnover  therefore  the allowance for inventory obsolescence is reviewed monthly and changes to the allowance are updated as new information is received 
income taxes deferred income taxes at the end of each period are determined by applying enacted tax rates applicable to future periods in which the taxes are expected to be paid or recovered to differences between the financial accounting and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
when required  impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized based on the fair value of the asset 
the fair value of these assets is determined based upon estimates of future cash flows  market value of similar assets  if available  or independent appraisals  if required 
in analyzing the fair value and recoverability using future cash flows  we make projections based on a number of assumptions and estimates of growth rates  future economic conditions  assignment of discount rates and estimates of terminal values 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows 
the measurement of impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset 
long lived assets to be disposed of and or held for sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
we determine the fair value of these assets in the same manner as described for assets held and used 
see long lived asset impairment in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are required to be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  using a fair value based test that compares the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
fair values are typically calculated using discounted expected future cash flows  using a risk adjusted discount rate 
the company performed the annual test for goodwill impairment related to the lytton and simclar mexico acquisitions 
these tests were performed at the reporting unit level 
in the test  we determined that the discounted sum of the expected future cash flows from the assets exceeded the carrying value of those assets  therefore  no impairment of goodwill was recognized 
in performing the tests for impairment  we made assumptions about future sales and profitability 
in estimating expected future cash flows related to the lytton and simclar mexico assets  we used internal forecasts that were based upon actual results  assuming an average revenue growth of and per year  respectively  and minimal increases in gross margin 
at the time of the impairment test  the carrying value of the net assets acquired in the lytton and simclar mexico transactions was and million  respectively 
if our estimate of expected future cash flows had been lower  the expected future cash flows would still have exceeded the carrying value of the assets by million for lytton and by million for simclar mexico  including goodwill 
the most critical estimates  in order of significance  used in the impairment test include estimated revenue growth  the terminal value assumed  and the discount rate applied 
we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering events nor the impact such events might have on reported asset values 
such events may include strategic decisions made in response to economic conditions relative to operations and the impact of technology  economic conditions  and industry trends on our customer base 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable the company s sales are primarily derived from product manufacturing including  but not limited to  finished molded and non molded cables  wiring harnesses  printed circuit board assemblies  electro mechanical and electronic assemblies 
revenue is recognized upon shipment of the product to the customer  under contractual terms  which are generally fob shipping point 
upon shipment  title transfers and the customer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership of the product 
the selling price of the product is fixed and the ability to collect for the sale to the customer is reasonably assured when the product is shipped 
revenue from contract manufacturing  rework and refurbishing is recognized upon shipment of the product to the customer  under contractual terms  which are generally fob shipping point 
business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired business to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on their estimated fair values 
such valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially related to intangible assets 
we used outside sources of information to complete a valuation to assist in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the simclar mexico acquisition completed during the purchased intangible assets were recorded by us at the fair value assigned 
critical estimates were used in valuing certain intangible assets and plant and equipment include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired customers continuing sales  and the expected useful life of plant and equipment 
our estimates are based upon assumptions we believe are reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable  as a result  actual results may differ from estimates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
sensitivity of results of operations to interest rate risks on our investments is managed by conservatively investing liquid funds in short term government securities and interest bearing accounts at financial institutions in which we had approximately  invested at december  interest rate risks on debt are managed by negotiation of appropriate rates on new financing obligations based on current market rates 
there is an interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt agreements which totaled approximately  at december  we have exposure to both rising and falling interest rates 
a decrease in rates on our year end investments would have an insignificant impact on our results of operations 
a increase in rates on our year end variable rate debt would result in a negative impact of approximately  on our operations 
our exposure to market risks from foreign currency exchange rates is minimal
