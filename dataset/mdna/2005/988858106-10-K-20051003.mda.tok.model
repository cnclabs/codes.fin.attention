consignment merchandise can be returned to the vendor at any time 
the company had approximately million and million 
table of contents of consignment inventory on hand at july  and  respectively 
during fiscal years and  the company purchased approximately percent and percent  respectively  of its merchandise from its top five vendors  including more than percent from its top vendor in fiscal year if supply between the company and these top vendors were disrupted  particularly at certain critical times during the year  the company s sales could be adversely affected in the short term until alternative supply arrangements could be established 
in fiscal year  purchases of internally produced merchandise represented approximately percent of total purchases 
the company historically has engaged in a limited amount of hedging activity with respect to merchandise held in inventory  as commodity prices have remained relatively stable

the supply and prices of diamonds in the principle world markets are significantly influenced by a single entity  the diamond trading company  which has traditionally controlled the marketing of a substantial majority of the world s supply of diamonds and sells rough diamonds to worldwide diamond cutters at prices determined in its sole discretion 
the availability of diamonds to the diamond trading company and the company s suppliers is to some extent dependent on the political situation in diamond producing countries and on continuation of prevailing supply and marketing arrangements for raw diamonds 
until alternate sources could be developed  any sustained interruption in the supply of diamonds or any oversupply from the producing countries could adversely affect the company and the retail jewelry industry as a whole 
within the jewelry industry there has been continued focus on conflict diamonds  which are allegedly extracted from war torn regions and sold by organizations to fund insurrection 
through an international system of certification and legislative initiatives  the diamond trade has taken steps to ensure the exclusion from the supply chain of these diamonds  which represent a small fraction of the world s supply 
it is not expected that such efforts  if successful  will substantially affect the supply of diamonds 
however  in the near term  efforts by non governmental organizations to increase consumer awareness of the issue and encourage legislative response could affect consumer demand for diamonds

table of contents cautionary notice regarding forward looking statements the company makes forward looking statements in this annual report on form k and in other reports the company files with the sec 
in addition  members of the company s senior management may make forward looking statements orally in presentations to analysts  investors  the media and others 
forward looking statements include statements regarding the company s objectives and expectations with respect to sales and earnings  merchandising and marketing strategies  store renovation  remodeling and expansion  inventory management and performance  liquidity and cash flows  capital structure  capital expenditures  development of its information technology plan and related management information systems  e commerce initiatives  human resource initiatives and other statements regarding the company s plans and objectives 
in addition  the words anticipate  estimate  project  intend  expect  believe  forecast  can  could  should  will  may  or similar expressions may identify forward looking statements  but some of these statements may use other phrasing 
these forward looking statements are intended to relay the company s expectations about the future  and speak only as of the date they are made 
the company disclaims any obligation to update or revise publicly or otherwise any forward looking statements to reflect subsequent events  new information or future circumstances 
forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and a variety of factors could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from the anticipated or expected results expressed in or suggested by these forward looking statements 
some of these factors are described below 
many of these factors  both described and not described  are beyond the company s control 
if the general economy performs poorly  discretionary spending on goods that are  or are perceived to be  luxuries may not grow and may even decrease 
jewelry purchases are discretionary and may be affected by adverse trends in the general economy and consumer perceptions of those trends 
in addition  a number of other factors affecting disposable consumer income such as employment  wages and salaries  business conditions  energy costs  credit availability and taxation policies  for the economy as a whole and in regional and local markets where the company operates  can impact sales and earnings 
the concentration of a substantial portion of the company s sales in three  relatively brief selling seasons means that the company s performance is more susceptible to disruptions 
a substantial portion of the company s sales are derived from three selling seasons holiday christmas  valentine s day  and mother s day 
because of the briefness of these three selling seasons  the opportunity for sales to recover in the event of a disruption or other difficulty is limited  and the impact of disruptions and difficulties can be significant 
for instance  adverse weather such as a blizzard  a significant interruption in the receipt of products whether because of vendor or other product problems  or a sharp decline in mall traffic occurring during one of these selling seasons  could materially impact sales for the affected season and  because of the importance of each of these selling seasons  commensurately impact overall sales and earnings 
most of the company s sales are of products that include diamonds  precious metals and other commodities  and fluctuations in the availability and pricing of commodities could impact the company s ability to obtain and produce products at favorable prices 
the supply and price of diamonds in the principal world markets are significantly influenced by a single entity  which has traditionally controlled the marketing of a substantial majority of the world s supply of diamonds and sells rough diamonds to worldwide diamond cutters at prices determined in its sole discretion 
the availability of diamonds also is somewhat dependent on the political conditions in diamond producing countries and on continuing supply of arrangements for raw diamonds 
any sustained interruption in this supply could have an adverse affect on the company 
the company also is affected by fluctuations in the price of diamonds  gold and other commodities 
the company historically has engaged in only a limited amount of hedging against fluctuations in the costs of gold 
a significant change in prices of key commodities could adversely affect the company s business by reducing operating margins or decreasing consumer demand if retail prices are increased significantly 

table of contents the company s sales are dependent upon mall traffic 
the company s stores  kiosks  and carts are located primarily in shopping malls throughout the us  canada and puerto rico 
the company s success is in part dependent upon the continued popularity of malls as a shopping destination and the ability of malls  their tenants and other mall attractions to generate customer traffic 
accordingly  a significant decline in this popularity  especially if it is sustained  would substantially harm the company s sales and earnings 
the company operates in a highly competitive industry 
the retail jewelry business is highly competitive  and the company competes with nationally recognized jewelry chains as well as a large number of independent regional and local jewelry retailers and other types of retailers who sell jewelry and gift items  such as department stores  mass merchandisers and catalog showrooms 
the company also is beginning to compete with internet sellers of jewelry 
because of the breadth and depth of this competition  the company constantly is under competitive pressure that both constrains pricing and requires extensive merchandising efforts in order for the company to remain competitive 
any failure by the company to manage its inventory effectively will negatively impact sales and earnings 
the company purchases much of its inventory well in advance of each selling season 
in the event the company misjudges consumer preferences or demand  the company will experience lower sales than expected and will have excessive inventory that may need to be written down in value or sold at prices that are less than expected 
because of the company s dependence upon a small number of landlords for a substantial number of the company s locations  any significant erosion of the company s relationships with those landlords would negatively impact the company s ability to obtain and retain store locations 
the company is significantly dependent on its ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs that allow the company to earn a reasonable return on its locations 
the company depends on the leasing market and its landlords to determine supply  demand  lease cost and operating costs and conditions 
the company cannot be certain as to when or whether desirable store locations will become or remain available to the company at reasonable lease and operating costs 
further  several large landlords dominate the ownership of prime malls  and the company is dependent upon maintaining good relations with those landlords in order to obtain and retain store locations on optimal terms 
from time to time the company does have disagreements with its landlords  and a significant disagreement  if not resolved  could have an adverse impact on the company 
changes in regulatory requirements relating to the extension of credit may increase the cost of or adversely affect the company s operations 
the company s operations are affected by numerous federal and state laws that impose disclosure and other requirements upon the origination  servicing and enforcement of credit accounts and limitations on the maximum aggregate amount of finance charges that may be charged by a credit provider 
any change in the regulation of credit including changes in the application of current laws which would materially limit the availability of credit to the company s customer base could adversely affect the company s sales and earnings 
any disruption in  or changes to  the company s private label credit card arrangement with citi may adversely affect the company s ability to provide consumer credit and write credit insurance 
the company s agreement with citi  through which citi provides financing for the company s customers to purchase merchandise through private label credit cards  enhances the company s ability to provide consumer credit and write credit insurance 
any disruption in  or change to  this agreement could have an adverse effect on the company  especially to the extent that it materially limits credit availability to the company s customer base 

table of contents acquisitions involve special risks  including the possibility that the company may not be able to integrate acquisitions into its existing operations 
the company has made significant acquisitions in the past and may in the future make additional acquisitions 
difficulty integrating an acquisition into the company s existing infrastructure and operations may cause the company to fail to realize expected return on investment through revenue increases  cost savings  increases in geographic or product presence and customer reach  and or other projected benefits from the acquisition 
additionally  attractive acquisition opportunities may not be available at the time or pursuant to terms acceptable to the company

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the accounting and financial reporting policies of the company are in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting policies requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
for example  unexpected changes in market conditions or a downturn in the economy could adversely affect actual results 
estimates are used in accounting for  among other things  inventory obsolescence  goodwill and long lived asset valuation  lifo inventory retail method  legal liability  credit insurance liability  product warranty  depreciation  employee benefits  tax  and contingencies 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
management believes the following accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
substantially all us inventories represent finished goods which are valued using the last in  first out lifo retail inventory method 
merchandise inventory of peoples jewellers and mappins jewellers of canada is valued using the first in  first out fifo retail inventory method 
under the retail method  inventory is segregated into categories of merchandise with similar characteristics at its current retail selling value 
the determination of inventory at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying an average cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventory 
the company is required to determine the lifo cost on an interim basis by estimating annual inflation trends  annual purchases and ending inventory levels for the fiscal year 
actual annual inflation rates and inventory balances as of the end of any fiscal year may differ from interim estimates 
the company applies internally developed indices that the company believes more consistently measure inflation or deflation in the components of its merchandise ie  diamonds  gold and other metals and precious stones and its merchandise mix 
the company believes the internally developed indices more accurately reflect inflation or deflation in its own prices than the us bureau of labor statistics bls producer price indices or other published indices 
the company also writes down its inventory for discontinued  slow moving and damaged inventory 
this write down is equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value based upon assumptions of targeted inventory turn rates  future demand  management strategy  and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or management strategy changes  additional inventory write downs may be required and  in the case of a major change in strategy or downturn in market conditions  such write downs could be significant 
for example  in fiscal year  in connection with a change in strategic direction  the company incurred an inventory charge of million 
shrinkage is estimated for the period from the last inventory date to the end of the fiscal year on a store by store basis 
such estimates are based on experience and the shrinkage results from the last physical inventory 
physical inventories are taken at least once annually for all store locations and for the distribution centers 
the shrinkage rate from the most recent physical inventory  in combination with historical experience and significant changes in physical inventory results could impact the shrinkage reserve 
long lived assets and goodwill long lived assets are periodically reviewed for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the assets with their estimated undiscounted future cashflows 
if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  the potential impairment is measured based on a projected discounted cash flow method  using a discount rate that is considered to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the company s current business model 
assumptions are made with respect to cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets based upon updated projections 
any changes in key assumptions  particularly store performance  or market conditions could result in an unanticipated impairment charge 
for instance  in the event of a major market downturn  individual stores may become 
table of contents unprofitable  which could result in a write down of the carrying value of the assets located in those stores 
any impairment would be recognized in operating results if a permanent reduction were to occur 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company tests goodwill for impairment annually  at the end of its second quarter  or more frequently if events occur which indicate a potential reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit s net assets below its carrying value 
an impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
the company calculates estimated fair value using the present value of future cash flows expected to be generated using a weighted average cost of capital and updated financial projections 
based upon the amounts currently recorded as goodwill  recent performance and estimated projections  the company believes the likelihood of additional impairment would not be material 
however  a significant change in the related brand s performance  such as the closing of a majority of the brand s stores  could result in additional impairment 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  the company performed its annual review for impairment of goodwill related to its piercing pagoda inc  people s jewellers and other smaller acquisitions 
the company concluded that there was no evidence of impairment related to the goodwill of approximately million for piercing pagoda  million recorded for the people s acquisition and million for other smaller acquisitions 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition 
revenue related to merchandise sales  which is approximately percent of total revenues  is recognized at the time of the sale  reduced by a provision for returns 
the provision for sales returns is based on historical evidence of the company s return rate 
repair revenues are recognized when the service is complete and the merchandise is delivered to the customers 
total revenues include extended service agreements that are recognized over the two year period in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing services under the agreements 
any significant change in the proportion of costs expected to be incurred in performing services under the agreements could result in a change in the amount of revenue recognized 
for instance  a percent change on an annual basis in the timing of services under these agreements could result in a percent change in the revenue recognized 
revenues also include premiums from the company s insurance businesses  principally related to credit insurance policies sold to customers who purchase the company s merchandise under the proprietary credit program 
insurance premiums are recognized over the coverage period 
other reserves the company is involved in a number of legal and governmental proceedings as part of the normal course of business 
reserves are established based on management s best estimates of the company s potential liability in these matters 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with in house and outside counsel and are based on a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
income taxes are estimated for each jurisdiction in which the company operates 
this involves assessing the current tax exposure together with temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial statement accounting purposes 
any resulting deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability based on estimated future taxable income 
to the extent that recovery is deemed not likely  a valuation allowance is recorded 
the company believes that as of july   the realization of its gross deferred tax assets is more likely than not and thus there was no valuation reserve recorded 
other matters in connection with the views expressed by the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission the sec on february   regarding certain lease accounting issues  the company  like many retailers  began a review of its lease accounting practices 
the sec letter clarified existing generally accepted accounting principles applicable to leases and leasehold improvements primarily related to accounting for construction allowances received from landlords and the period over which rent payments were amortized 
in prior periods  and consistent with industry practice  the company recognized the minimum rent payments evenly across the period beginning with the commencement date of the lease through the end of 
table of contents the lease term  typically months 
this period excludes the construction period  typically two to three months  in which the company had access to the property but which preceded the lease term 
the sec s views clarified that the construction period should be included in the period over which the company amortizes the minimum rent payments 
the company reviewed its lease portfolio 
based upon this review  the company determined that the cumulative impact as of january   of correcting this error by commencing the amortization period earlier was additional expense related to prior periods of approximately million before taxes  or million and per share after taxes
