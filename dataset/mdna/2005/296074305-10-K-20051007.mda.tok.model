as of june   escalon complied with these requirements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that impact amounts reported therein 
the most significant of those involve the application of statement of accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  discussed further in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and  as such  include amounts based on informed estimates and judgments of management 
for example  estimates are used in determining valuation allowances for deferred income taxes  uncollectible receivables  obsolete inventory  sales returns and rebates and purchased intangible assets 
actual results achieved in the future could differ from current estimates 
the company used what it believes are reasonable assumptions and  where applicable  established valuation techniques in making its estimates 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products at the time of shipment  when title and risk of loss transfer 
the company provides products to its distributors at agreed wholesale prices and to the balance of its customers at set retail prices 
distributors can receive discounts for accepting high volume shipments 
the discounts are reflected immediately in the net invoice price  which is the basis for revenue recognition 
no further material discounts are given 
the company s considerations for recognizing revenue upon shipment of product to a distributor are based on the following persuasive evidence that an arrangement purchase order and sales invoice exists between a willing buyer distributor and the company that outlines the terms of the sale company information  quantity of goods  purchase price and payment terms 
the buyer distributor does not have a right of return 
shipping terms are ex factory shipping point 
at this point the buyer distributor takes title to the goods and is responsible for all risks and rewards of ownership  including insuring the goods as necessary 
the company s price to the buyer distributor is fixed and determinable as specifically outlined on the sales invoice 
the sales arrangement does not have customer cancellation or termination clauses 
the buyer distributor places a purchase order with the company  the terms of the sale are cash  cod or credit 
customer credit is determined based on the company s policies and procedures related to the buyer s distributor s creditworthiness 
based on this determination  the company believes that collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company assesses collectibility based on creditworthiness of the customer and past transaction history 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and does not require collateral from its customers 
for many of the company s international customers  the company requires an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by the customer before the purchase order is accepted 
valuation of intangible assets escalon annually evaluates for impairment its intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
these intangible assets include goodwill  trademarks and trade names 
factors the company considers important that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if these criteria indicate that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  an evaluation of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset is made 
if this evaluation indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial statements if and when an impairment charge is recorded 
no impairment losses were recorded for goodwill  trademarks and trade names during any of the periods presented based on these evaluations 
income loss per share the company computes net income loss per share under the provisions of sfas no 
 earnings per share  sfas and staff accounting bulletin  no 
sab 
under the provisions of sfas and sab  basic and diluted net income loss per share is computed by dividing the net income loss for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period 
the calculation of diluted net income loss per share excludes potential common shares if the impact is anti dilutive 
basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period 
diluted earnings per share are determined in the same manner as basic earnings per share  except that the number of shares is increased by assuming exercise of dilutive stock options and warrants using the treasury stock method 
taxes estimates of taxable income of the various legal entities and jurisdictions are used in the tax rate calculation 
management uses judgment in estimating what the company s income will be for the year 
since judgment is involved  there is a risk that the tax rate may significantly increase or decrease in any period 
in determining income loss for financial statement purposes  management must make certain estimates and judgments 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
sfas accounting for income taxes also requires that the deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance  if based on the available evidence  it is more likely that not that all or some portion of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
in evaluating the company s ability to recover the company s deferred tax assets  management considers all available positive and negative evidence including the company s past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses and near term forecasts of future taxable income that is consistent with the plans and estimates management is using to manage the underlying businesses 
through june   the company has recorded a full valuation allowance against the company s net operating losses due to uncertainty of their realization as a result of the company s earnings history  the number of years the company s net operating losses and tax credits can be carried forward  the existence of taxable temporary differences and near term earnings expectations 
the amount of the valuation allowance could decrease if facts and circumstances change that materially increase taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss carryforwards 
any reduction would reduce increase the income tax expense benefit in the period such determination is made by the company
