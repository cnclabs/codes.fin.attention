item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in thousands introduction the following discussion provides an assessment of the results of our operations and liquidity and capital resources together with a brief description of certain accounting policies 
accordingly  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included within this report 
overview we  through our operating subsidiaries  are one of the world s leading manufacturers of musical instruments 
our strategy is to capitalize on our strong brand names  leading market positions  strong distribution networks  and quality products 
piano segment sales of our pianos are influenced by general economic conditions  demographic trends and general interest in music and the arts 
the operating results of our piano segment are primarily affected by steinway sons grand piano sales 
given the total number of these pianos that we sell in any year  sold in  a slight change in units sold can have a material impact on our business and operating results 
our results are also influenced by sales of boston and essex pianos  which together represented approximately of total piano units sold but less than of total piano revenues in our boston and essex piano lines are manufactured in asia  each by a single manufacturer 
the ability of these manufacturers to produce and ship products to us could impact our business and operating results 
in  approximately of piano sales were in the united states  in europe and the remaining primarily in asia 
for the year ended december   our piano segment sales were million  representing of our total revenues 
piano outlook for we expect another successful year for our piano segment with continued growth in revenue 
gross margins should remain relatively stable as we expect somewhat higher production levels to offset manufacturing cost increases 
we expect the higher costs of boston inventory purchases caused by unfavorable exchange rates to be mitigated by price increases we have already implemented 
we currently have sufficient  but not excessive  manufacturing capacity to meet anticipated or increased demand 
band segment our student band instrument sales are influenced by trends in school enrollment  general attitudes toward music and the arts and our ability to provide competitively priced products to our dealer network 
management estimates that of our domestic band sales are generated through educational programs 
our school instrument business is correlated to the number of school children in the united states  which has peaked and is expected to remain relatively stable over the next few years 
however  our sales growth has been adversely affected in recent years by the abundance of competitively priced imported student instruments available to our dealers and their ability to purchase these products directly from offshore sources 
in order to compete with these mass merchandised offshore instruments  we restructured our product offerings to include quality  competitively priced brand name imported instruments that are built to our specifications 
we now offer quality controlled  brand name products at multiple price points through distribution channels which support the music education market 
our product offerings are tailored to the needs of traditional school music dealers who provide full service rental programs to beginning band students  as well as music retailers and e commerce dealers selling directly to end consumers from their stores or through the internet 
consistent with past patterns  beginner instruments accounted for approximately of band orchestral unit shipments and approximately of band instrument revenues in  with advanced and professional instruments representing the balance 
in  approximately of band sales were in the united states  in europe and the remaining primarily in asia 
for the year ended december   our band sales were million  representing of our total revenues 
band outlook for we continue to see shifts in the buying patterns of our dealers within and between our various distribution channels 
accordingly  pinpointing the demand for our products at the student  institutional  and professional levels  synchronizing product availability with demand  and filling the needs of our distribution channels in both domestic and export markets has become far more challenging than in the past 
this process will continue to be a major focus for us going forward 
we expect a demanding first half of the year as we complete the integration of the leblanc operations and product offerings into our business and strive to improve productivity at locations affected by our facility rationalization activities 
the latter half of the year should show improvement over past performance  both in net sales and gross margin 
we anticipate a gradual return to more efficient production levels and a more appropriate balance of manufactured and imported products to meet demand for the back to school selling season 
inflation and foreign currency impact although we cannot accurately predict the precise effect of inflation on our operations  we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on sales or results of operations in recent years 
sales to customers outside the united states represented of consolidated sales in we record sales in euro  japanese yen  british pounds  and chinese renminbi 
in  we generated of our international sales through our piano segment and  solely as a result of foreign exchange rate changes  piano sales increased million 
although currency fluctuation affects international sales  it also affects cost of sales and related operating expenses 
consequently  it generally has not had a material impact on operating income 
we use financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts and currency options to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on firm and anticipated cash flow exposures and certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the affected division 
we do not purchase currency related financial instruments for purposes other than exchange rate risk management 
taxes we are subject to us income taxes as well as tax in several foreign jurisdictions in which we do business 
some of these foreign jurisdictions have higher statutory rates than the us in addition  certain of our operations are subject to both us and foreign taxes 
however  in such cases we receive a credit against our us taxes for foreign taxes paid equal to the percentage that such foreign income represents of the total income subject to us tax 
accordingly  our effective tax rates will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to us income and the absorption of foreign tax credits in the us in  we were not able to utilize foreign tax credits carried forward from prior years  but were effective at using many of the foreign tax credits generated that period 
in  we were able to utilize foreign tax credits carried forward from prior years due to the higher proportion of our foreign source income to overall income 
in  we were able to use the majority  but not all  of the foreign tax credits generated in the current period 
however  because the american jobs creation act of the act extended the foreign tax credit carryover period we were able to recognize a partial benefit for the current year s excess foreign tax credits 
the strengthening of our domestic piano and band businesses is expected to result in less effective use of our foreign tax credits and credit carryforwards in the upcoming year 
in addition  the states in which we do business have either repealed or are likely to repeal legislation that had been beneficial to tax paying businesses 
these events may have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate for conversely  we expect to benefit from other provisions of the act  such as the additional tax deduction provided to domestic manufacturers 
to date  we have not fully assessed the impact of all these tax law changes but currently expect our effective tax rate to increase in relative to results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year change for years ended december  net sales band piano total sales cost of sales band piano total cost of sales gross profit band piano total gross profit operating expenses facility rationalization total operating expenses income from operations other income  net net interest expense income before income taxes income tax provision net income overview was a year committed to improvement of our band business 
we continued the facility rationalization project started in  closing one of our elkhart  indiana plants in april and moving production into existing facilities 
our redesigned distribution policy enabled us to grow our e commerce  catalog  music retailer  professional  and export sales categories 
our expanded product line  which includes lower priced  brand name sourced instruments  has been well accepted in the marketplace  and we experienced increases in sales of these products once we worked through availability issues 
however  we maintained lower than normal production levels for certain products in order to manage inventory levels  which adversely impacted margins 
we were presented with the opportunity to purchase substantially all of the assets of g 
leblanc corporation  which enabled us to strengthen our existing band product lines 
leblanc faces the same excess capacity issues we have experienced  announcing the closure of one of its manufacturing facilities just prior to the acquisition 
accordingly  we expect our overall production rationalization activities to extend beyond the timeframe originally anticipated as we factor leblanc s production capabilities into our analysis 
our piano business had a very successful year 
domestic wholesale sales remained strong  and retail sales were bolstered by the two additional retail stores that were fully operational for all of our european business remained stable  while our asian business improved  primarily due to our shanghai facility being operational since spring although sales and marketing expenses were higher than expected  these costs were more than offset by margin improvements due to improved production levels  efficiencies  and product mix 
net sales net sales increased million 
this resulted in part from a increase in steinway grand unit shipments  as well as a million benefit attributable to foreign exchange 
the total piano sales increase of million also reflects the increase in higher priced retail unit sales resulting from our additional domestic storefronts being operational for the full year  as well as strong wholesale shipments throughout the year 
band orchestral instrument sales increased million on an overall unit increase of 
the band sales increase includes million attributable to the leblanc acquisition  with the remainder resulting from core business growth  especially professional brass and percussion instruments 
gross profit gross profit improved million primarily due to the piano margin improvement from to 
higher domestic production levels  overseas production and labor efficiencies  and improved retail sales were the primary drivers of the increase 
a shift in our international divisions sales mix towards higher margin grands also contributed to the improvement 
although band segment gross profit improved million  gross margins declined slightly 
atypical charges affecting margin in totaled million  comprised primarily of severance and higher costs associated with the acquisition write up of leblanc inventory to fair value 
in  atypical charges totaled million  including severance costs  strike costs  and inventory impairment charges 
despite the reduction in atypical charges and improved margins on imported student products  gross margins decreased slightly from to 
this was primarily due to increased freight expenses  production inefficiencies for some woodwind products  and reduced production levels of certain brass instruments 
significant increases in costs of raw materials such as silver and copper also adversely affected band gross margins 
operating expenses operating expenses increased million despite the million decrease in impairment charges compared to the prior year 
over million of this increase resulted from external costs associated with our sarbanes oxley compliance project 
million of the increase is attributable to foreign exchange  and we incurred incremental expenses of million associated with leblanc 
the remainder of the increase resulted primarily from increased advertising and promotional costs and increased bonus payments 
non operating expenses non operating expenses increased million primarily due to the additional interest expense resulting from our issuance of million of senior notes in february results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year change for years ended december  net sales band piano total sales cost of sales band piano total cost of sales gross profit band piano total gross profit operating expenses facility rationalization total operating expenses income from operations other income  net net interest expense income before income taxes income tax provision net income overview was a year of transition in our band business 
our results were negatively impacted early on by strikes at two of our plants 
we began a facility rationalization project to reduce manufacturing space by and position the business to improve future margins on manufactured products 
we reduced production in order to bring down excess manufactured inventory levels 
lastly  in october  we expanded our product line and introduced many new  quality controlled sourced products that have been made to our specifications 
we also revamped our distribution policy to include channels not previously utilized and now offer step up and professional instruments through catalogs and via the internet 
additionally  we now offer school music dealers a full line of instruments  including lower priced  brand name instruments which are a favorable alternative to mass produced  offshore products 
our piano business started out slow but recovered in the last two quarters of while steinway sons th anniversary celebration caused sales and marketing expenses to increase  we believe that the additional publicity generated by this milestone event helped generate sales interest in the second half of the year 
however  due to the long production cycles for steinway pianos and the lead time required for ordering sourced pianos  we were unable to match the increase in demand by year end 
net sales the increase in net sales of million resulted from a million improvement in piano sales  which occurred despite relatively flat steinway grand units shipments 
the piano sales increase reflects million in benefit attributable to foreign exchange  as well as annual price increases and a shift in mix towards higher priced retail units 
band orchestral instrument sales decreased million on an overall unit decrease of  reflecting the decreased demand for higher cost beginner instruments 
the delay in availability of product resulting from the union strikes at our lagrange  illinois and eastlake  ohio plants settled in march and may  respectively also contributed to the sales shortfall 
these factors were mitigated in part by a shift in sales mix towards higher priced step up and professional instruments and an increase in percussion unit shipments 
gross profit gross profit decreased million in as both the piano and band segments experienced deteriorating gross margins 
piano margins decreased slightly to despite the shift towards retail units  primarily due to the million resulting from unfavorable foreign exchange rates on boston inventory purchases 
gross margins for the band orchestral segment declined to  corresponding to a gross profit decrease of million 
this decrease includes million paid to employees in accordance with the terms of expired labor contracts  and million in underabsorbed overhead and lost profit resulting from the work stoppages at two of our plants 
in addition  we incurred million in inventory impairment charges and million in severance costs associated with the closure of our nogales  arizona woodwind manufacturing facility and the imminent april closure of one of our elkhart  indiana woodwind manufacturing facilities 
production levels  which were reduced at one of our brass instrument plants in order to manage excess inventory levels  and increased pension expenses of million  also adversely impacted band segment margins in operating expenses operating expenses increased million  primarily as a result of the million of impairment charges taken on land  building  and equipment relating to our nogales  arizona and elkhart  indiana woodwind manufacturing facilities 
foreign currency translation negatively impacted operating expenses by million and additional sales and marketing expenses of over million incurred in conjunction with steinway sons th anniversary celebration were also a factor 
offsetting these costs was million in savings realized by the band segment through administrative staff reductions and lower sales and marketing expenses 
non operating expenses non operating expenses decreased million to million in primarily due to lower net interest resulting from the use of cash from operations  as opposed to line of credit borrowings  in the current period 
in addition  our debt buyback of million in december lowered interest expense by million 
liquidity and capital resources we have relied primarily upon cash provided by operations  supplemented as necessary by seasonal borrowings under our working capital line  to finance our operations  repay long term indebtedness  finance acquisitions  and fund our capital expenditures 
cash flows our statements of cash flows are summarized as follows for the years ended december  net income changes in operating assets and liabilities other adjustments to reconcile net income to cash from operating activities cash flows from operating activities cash flows from investing activities cash flows from financing activities in  cash flows from operating activities decreased million 
this increased use of cash was caused primarily by a a million rise in piano inventory levels to support our expansion in asia  b million in higher receivables primarily associated with band sales increases  and c million transferred to workers compensation and environmental depositary trust funds which replaced more expensive letters of credit previously used 
in  cash flows from operating activities increased million despite the million decrease in net income primarily as a result of our control over inventory  reduced manufacturing levels  and management of our accounts receivable and payable 
in  inventory and accounts receivable management contributed million to cash flows from operations 
cash used for investing activities of million is primarily due to our acquisition of certain assets of g 
leblanc corporation for million in august the final purchase price for the business acquisition is subject to adjustment and has not been finalized 
accordingly  additional cash expenditures may be necessary 
year over year  capital expenditures were relatively comparable at million in  million in and million in see capital expenditures discussion below 
in  cash provided by financing activities of million resulted from stock option exercises and stock purchase plan activities totaling million  which more than offset the million in net borrowings and scheduled debt amortization on our lines of credit 
in  financing activities consisted primarily of scheduled debt amortization of million  counterbalanced in part by net borrowings of million on our foreign lines of credit 
these borrowings were made primarily to support an increase in working capital 
in  cash used for financing activities resulted from the scheduled amortization of our term loans of million  as well as the repurchase of million of our senior notes 
see borrowing activities and availability discussion below 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures consist primarily of machinery and equipment purchases  system upgrades  and facility improvements 
in  we expect our capital spending to be in the range of million relating to factory improvements  equipment  process  and tooling upgrades  and machinery and equipment purchases 
seasonality consistent with industry practice  we sell band instruments almost entirely on credit utilizing the two financing programs described below 
due to these programs  we have large working capital requirements during certain times of the year when band instrument receivable balances reach highs of approximately million in august and september  and lesser requirements when they are at lows of approximately million in january and february 
the financing options  intended to assist dealers with the seasonality inherent in the industry and facilitate the rent to own programs offered to students by many retailers  also allow us to match our production and delivery schedules 
the following forms of financing are offered to qualified band instrument dealers a receivable dating payments on purchases made from january through august are due in october 
payments on purchases made from september to december are due in january 
dealers are offered discounts for early payment 
b note receivable financing qualified dealers may convert open accounts to a note payable to us 
the note program is offered in january and october and coincides with the receivable dating program 
in most instances  the note receivable is secured by dealer inventories and receivables 
off balance sheet arrangements in  our customers financed notes receivable with a third party  to which we had a recourse obligation under the financing agreement 
we received proceeds of million from the financing of such notes 
in  no customer receivables were subject to such financing or recourse obligations 
in  certain customers of our leblanc subsidiary financed notes receivable with a third party  to which we have a recourse obligation 
we received proceeds of million from the customer financing of such notes 
as of december   the outstanding balance on these customer notes was million 
we have included a corresponding recourse obligation of million in other current liabilities as of december  we expect the duration of our recourse obligation not to exceed one year 
our total maximum recourse obligation under this arrangement includes the outstanding balance on the notes  as well as any interest or late fees that may be incurred by our customers 
we received an indemnification from g 
leblanc corporation in connection with our acquisition of certain of its assets and assumption of certain liabilities 
see note as of december   we have recognized a receivable of million associated with this indemnification 
unlike many of our competitors in the piano industry  with limited exceptions  we do not provide extended financing arrangements to our dealers 
to facilitate long term financing required by some dealers  we have arranged financing through third party providers 
we generally provide no guarantees with respect to these arrangements 
retail financing obligations certain of our foreign retail sales were financed by our customers through a local bank under an arrangement that included an obligation on our part to repurchase pianos seized by the bank upon default of the customer 
the buy back price is established as a percentage of the original sales price  starting at in the first year and declining to in the fifth year of the loan 
this program ceased in the first quarter of nevertheless  because our obligation continues until the bank is paid in full by the customer  our commitment can remain outstanding for up to years the maximum term of the consumer loan 
our maximum obligation under this arrangement is estimated to be approximately million million at the december  exchange rate 
to date  we have not been required to repurchase any pianos under this program and we believe the likelihood of such repurchases in the future is remote 
accordingly  we have not recognized a liability for this obligation in our financial statements 
further  in the unlikely event of a repurchase  we believe the proceeds received upon our resale of the piano would exceed the amount payable to the bank 
pensions and other postretirement benefits when determining the amounts to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to our domestic pension and other postretirement benefits  we used a long term rate of return on plan assets of  which was developed with input from our actuaries and our investment committee  and is consistent with prior years 
we believe that is consistent with the historical long term return trends on our domestic pension assets and our expectations for future returns 
the discount rate utilized for determining future pension obligations for our domestic plans is based on long term bonds receiving an aa or better rating by a recognized rating agency 
the resulting discount rate decreased from at december  to at december  the discount rates and rates of returns on plan assets for our foreign pension and other postretirement benefit plans were similarly developed utilizing long term rates of return and discount rates reasonably expected to occur in the applicable jurisdiction 
borrowing activities and availability our real estate term loan  acquisition term loan  and domestic  seasonal borrowing requirements are accommodated through a committed credit facility with a syndicate of domestic lenders the credit facility 
the credit facility provides us with a potential borrowing capacity of million in revolving credit loans  and expires on september  borrowings are collateralized by our domestic accounts receivable  inventory  and fixed assets 
as of december   there were no revolving credit loans outstanding and availability based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances was approximately million  net of letters of credit 
the real estate term loan is payable in monthly installments of million and includes interest at average day libor at december  plus 
this term loan is secured by all of our interests in the steinway hall property 
the acquisition term loan is repayable in monthly installments of million through august and monthly installments of million from september through september the acquisition term loan and revolving credit loans bear interest at average day libor plus 
all of our borrowings under the credit facility are secured by a first lien on our domestic inventory  receivables  and fixed assets 
open account loans with foreign banks also provide for borrowings of up to million million at december  by steinway s foreign subsidiaries 
on april   we issued million senior notes due in december we repurchased million of our senior notes at 
in february we purchased  shares of our ordinary common stock directly from our then largest institutional shareholder 
in exchange  we issued million in principal amount of our senior notes due under the existing indenture 
we issued these bonds at a premium of 
this transaction increased our treasury stock by million 
at december   our total outstanding indebtedness amounted to million  consisting of million of senior notes  million on the real estate term loan  million on the acquisition term loan  and million of notes payable to foreign banks 
cash interest paid was million in  million in  and million in all of our debt agreements contain covenants that place certain restrictions on us  including our ability to incur additional indebtedness  to make investments in other entities and to pay cash dividends 
we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december  and do not anticipate any compliance issues in our bond indenture contains limitations  based on net income among other things  on the amount of discretionary repurchases we may make of our ordinary common stock 
our intent and ability to repurchase additional ordinary common stock either directly from shareholders or on the open market is directly affected by this limitation 
on august  we purchased substantially all of the net assets of g 
leblanc corporation  a manufacturer of high quality band instruments  for million 
the purchase price is subject to final purchase price adjustments 
we funded this acquisition with approximately million in cash  supplemented by borrowings on our credit facility  which were paid off by december  we have reserved  shares of our existing treasury stock to be utilized for the exercise of outstanding stock options under our amended and restated stock plan 
these options have no impact on our cash flow or the number of shares outstanding unless and until the options are exercised 
we experience long production and inventory turnover cycles  which we constantly monitor since fluctuations in demand can have a significant impact on these cycles 
with the exception of the leblanc acquisition  our credit facility went virtually unused throughout the year 
despite our facility rationalization project and additional interest obligations  we were able to effectively utilize cash flow from operations to fund our debt and capital requirements in looking forward to  we anticipate that both the piano and band divisions will perform consistently in the first half of the year  and band results are expected to improve once we have sold through the higher cost inventory resulting from the leblanc acquisition 
our intention is to keep our balance sheet strong by managing accounts receivable  maintaining sufficient  but not excessive  inventory levels  and repaying debt 
we do not have any current plans or intentions that will have a material impact on our liquidity in  although we may consider acquisitions that may require funding from operations or from our credit facilities 
other than those described  we are not aware of any trends  demands  commitments  or costs of resources that are expected to materially impact our liquidity or capital resources 
accordingly  we believe that cash on hand  together with cash flows anticipated from operations and available borrowings under the credit facility  will be adequate to meet our debt service requirements  fund continuing capital requirements and satisfy our working capital and general corporate needs through contractual obligations the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations at december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total notes to contractual obligations long term debt represents long term debt obligations and the fixed interest on our notes 
the nature of our long term debt obligations is described more fully in the borrowing availability and activities section of liquidity and capital resources 
approximately million of our operating lease obligations are attributable to the ninety nine year land lease associated with the purchase of steinway hall  which is described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included within this filing  the remainder is attributable to the leasing of other facilities and equipment 
purchase obligations consist of firm purchase commitments for raw materials and equipment 
our other long term liabilities consist primarily of the long term portion of our pension obligations  which are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included within this filing  and obligations under employee and consultant agreements  which are described in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included within this filing 
critical accounting estimates the application of many accounting policies involves estimates and assumptions that have a material impact on our reported results 
we establish reserves for inventory  workers compensation  warranty claims  accounts receivable  notes receivable  including recourse reserves when our customers have financed notes receivable with a third party  all of which are developed using certain estimates 
we have significant experience and data on which to base these estimates 
historical information is adjusted for specific uncertainties  such as new product introductions  and contemporaneous information  such as price fluctuations 
we regularly perform assessments of the underlying assumptions we use 
the impairment if any and recoverability of long lived assets  the selection of assumptions used to determine pension expense or income  the allocation of purchase price for businesses acquired  and certain components of our tax provision calculation  such as valuation allowances on deferred tax assets  the ability to utilize foreign tax credits  and income tax contingencies are based on estimates that require a greater degree of management judgment 
we believe the assumptions made by management provide a reasonable basis for the estimates reflected in our financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb revised statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 share based payments sfas no 
r 
this accounting standard  which is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after june   requires the recognition of compensation expense related to stock options using the fair value method 
we plan to adopt sfas no 
r in the third quarter of using the statement s modified prospective application method 
based on current outstanding awards  expected participation in the employee stock purchase plan consistent with past patterns  and no significant changes in the number of shares of outstanding stock  we anticipate an impact on earnings of approximately 
per share in in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 

this accounting standard  which is effective for annual periods beginning after june   requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results or operations 
in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin r consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin r 
this interpretation  which is effective for public entities by the end of the first reporting period ending after december   addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities that have certain characteristics 
the adoption of fin r had no impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we are subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we mitigate our cash flow exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by holding forward foreign currency contracts 
they are not designed as hedges for accounting purposes 
these contracts relate primarily to intercompany transactions and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair value of the forward foreign currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
as of december   a negative change in foreign currency exchange rates from market rates would decrease the fair value of the contracts by approximately million 
gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts are defined as the difference between the contract rate at its inception date and the current forward rate 
however  we would offset any such gains and losses by corresponding losses and gains  respectively  on the related asset or liability 
interest risk our interest rate exposure is limited primarily to interest rate changes on our variable rate debt 
the credit facility and term loans bear interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in libor 
for the year ended december   a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have increased our interest expense by approximately million 
we use interest rate caps to manage a portion of our interest rate risk on foreign debt 
we have not designated these instruments as hedges for accounting purposes 
the carrying value of the caps is not material and a change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of the caps 
our long term debt includes million of senior notes with a fixed interest rate 
accordingly  there would be no immediate impact on our interest expense associated with these notes due to fluctuations in market interest rates 
however  based on a hypothetical immediate decrease in market interest rates  the fair value of our senior notes  which would be sensitive to such interest rate changes  would be increased by approximately million as of december  such fair value changes may affect our determination whether to retain  replace or retire these notes
