highlights revenue increased and earnings per diluted share increased over the year ended december  political revenue in increased million over the prior year driven by political spending at our stations located in of of the key presidential primary and battleground states 
the summer olympics contributed approximately million in revenue at our nbc affiliated stations 
our core advertising business was strong due to increases in our automotive  retail  furniture house wares  financial services  telecommunication  and pharmaceutical categories 
we completed the purchase of wmtw tv in portland auburn  maine  on july   for million  including acquisition costs

industry trends political advertising increases in even numbered years  such as  due to the increase in the number of candidates running for political office 
revenue from olympic advertising occurs exclusively in even numbered years  such as  with the alternating winter and summer games occurring every two years 
the federal communications commission fcc has mandated that all broadcast television stations broadcast using a digital signal by may  and return the non digital analog signal to the government by july  the fcc is authorized to extend the return of the analog signal for various reasons including the percentage of television households able to receive the signal 
the fcc has permitted broadcast television station licensees to use their digital spectrum for a wide variety of services such as high definition television programming  audio  data and other types of communication  subject to the requirement that each broadcaster provide at least one free video channel equal in quality to the current technical standards 
the fcc is currently considering reducing the restrictions on ownership including newspaper television cross ownership 
these regulations have met opposition from both the public and within 
table of contents the government and may not be ratified 
the lack of clarity concerning ownership rules can reduce our ability to purchase  sell and or swap stations in certain markets 
compensation from networks to their affiliates in exchange for broadcasting of network programming has been sharply reduced in recent years and may be eliminated in the future in lieu of further network and affiliate relationships 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting policies we have identified the accounting policies below as integral to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our primary source of revenue is television advertising 
other sources include network compensation and other revenue 
advertising revenue and network compensation together represented approximately of our total revenue in each of the years ended december   and advertising revenue 
advertising revenue is recognized net of agency and national representatives commissions and in the period when the commercials are broadcast 
barter and trade revenue are included in advertising revenue and are also recognized when the commercials are broadcast 
see barter and trade transactions below 
network compensation 
twelve of our stations have network compensation agreements with abc  ten have agreements with nbc  and two have agreements with cbs 
in connection with the abc and cbs agreements  revenue is recognized when our stations broadcast specific network television programs based upon a negotiated value for each program 
in connection with the nbc agreements  revenue is recognized on a straight line basis  based upon the cash compensation to be paid to our stations by nbc each year 
unlike the abc and cbs agreements  the nbc network compensation is an annual amount and is not specifically assigned to individual network television programs 
other revenue 
we generate revenue from other sources  which include the following types of transactions and activities i management fees earned from the hearst corporation hearst  ii services revenue from lifetime entertainment services 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  iii services revenue from the production of commercials for advertising customers or from the production of programs to be sold in syndication  iv rental income pursuant to tower lease agreements with third parties providing for attachment of antennas to our towers  and v other miscellaneous revenue  such as licenses and royalties 
accounts receivable we extend credit based upon our evaluation of a customer s credit worthiness and financial condition 
for certain advertisers  we do not extend credit and require cash payment in advance 
we monitor the collection of receivables and we maintain an allowance for estimated losses based upon the aging of such receivables and specific collection issues that may be identified 
concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is generally limited due to the large number of geographically diverse customers  individually small balances  and short payment terms 
program rights program rights represent the right to air various forms of existing programming 
program rights and the corresponding contractual obligations are recorded when the license period begins and the programs are available for use 
program rights are carried at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value 
costs of first run programming are amortized over the license period of the program  which is generally one year 
costs of off network syndicated products  feature films  and cartoons are amortized on the future number of showings on an accelerated basis  contemplating the estimated revenue to be earned per showing  but generally not exceeding five years 
barter and trade transactions barter transactions represent the exchange of commercial air time for programming 
trade transactions represent the exchange of commercial air time for merchandise or services 
barter transactions are generally recorded at the fair market value of the commercial airtime relinquished 
trade transactions are generally recorded at the fair market value of the merchandise or services received 

table of contents barter program rights and payables are recorded for barter transactions based upon the availability of the broadcast property 
revenue is recognized on barter and trade transactions when the commercials are broadcast  expenses are recorded when the merchandise or service received is utilized 
intangible assets intangible assets are recorded at cost and include fcc licenses  network affiliations  goodwill  and other intangible assets such as advertiser client base and favorable leases 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
as a result  we no longer amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives fcc licenses  but instead perform a review for impairment annually  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
in connection with the adoption of sfas  amortization expense related to goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles decreased by approximately million annually 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
upon adoption of sfas on january  and again in the fourth quarters of  and  we completed an impairment review and found no impairment to the carrying value of goodwill or fcc licenses 
had we used different assumptions in developing our estimates  our reported results may have varied 
we consider the assumptions used in our estimates to be reasonable 
we amortize intangible assets with determinable useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values 
upon adoption of sfas on january   we determined the remaining useful life of our network affiliation intangible assets to be approximately years and the remaining useful life of our advertiser client base intangible asset to be approximately years 
we amortize favorable lease intangible assets over the respective terms of each lease 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate the remaining useful life of our intangible assets with determinable lives each reporting period to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
prior to the adoption of sfas on january   we amortized goodwill and intangible assets over periods ranging from three to years 
the recoverability of the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets was evaluated quarterly to determine if an impairment in value had occurred 
pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  an impairment in value was considered to have occurred when it had been determined that the undiscounted future operating cash flows generated by the acquired business were not sufficient to recover the carrying value of an intangible asset 
if it had been determined that an impairment in value had occurred  goodwill and intangible assets would have been written down to an amount equivalent to the present value of the estimated undiscounted future operating cash flows to be generated by the acquired business 
as of december   it was determined that there had been no impairment of intangible assets 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the differences in the book and tax bases of certain assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not  that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
income tax expense was million or of pre tax income in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  deferred tax assets were approximately million and deferred tax liabilities were approximately million as of december  our estimates of income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred assets and liabilities are set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these estimates reflect our assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the consolidated financial statements  giving consideration to both timing and probability 
actual income taxes could vary from such estimates as a result of future changes in income tax law or reviews by the internal revenue service or other tax authorities 
the deferred tax liability primarily relates to differences between book and tax basis of our fcc licenses 
in accordance with the adoption of sfas on january   we no longer amortize our fcc licenses  but instead test them for impairment annually 
as the tax basis in our fcc licenses continues to amortize  our 
table of contents deferred tax liability will increase over time 
we do not expect the significant portion of our deferred tax liability to reverse over time unless i our fcc licenses become impaired  or ii our fcc licenses are sold for cash  which would typically only occur in connection with the sale of net assets of a station or groups of stations or the entire company 
related party transactions we have management and services agreements as well as a series of other related agreements with hearst 
revenue and expenses recorded by us in connection with such agreements amounted to less than of our total revenue and less than of our total operating expenses in each of the years ended december  and see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these and other related party transactions 
we believe that the terms of the management and services agreements are reasonable to both parties  however  there can be no assurance that more favorable terms would not be available from third parties 
purchase accounting when allocating the purchase price in a purchase transaction to the acquired assets tangible and intangible and assumed liabilities  it is necessary to develop estimates of fair value 
we utilize the services of an independent valuation consulting firm for the purpose of estimating fair values 
the specialized tangible assets in use at a broadcasting business are typically valued on the basis of the replacement cost of a new asset less observed depreciation 
the appraisal of other fixed assets  such as furnishings  vehicles  and office machines  is based upon a comparable market approach 
identified intangible assets  including fcc licenses  are valued at estimated fair value 
fcc licenses are valued using a direct approach 
the direct approach measures the economic benefits that the fcc license brings to its holder 
the fair market value of the fcc license is determined by discounting these future benefits utilizing discounted cash flows 
the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis include initial and subsequent capital costs  network affiliation  vhf or uhf status  market revenue growth and station market share projections  operating profit margins  discount rates and terminal value estimates 
off balance sheet financings and liabilities other than agreements for future barter and program rights not yet available for broadcast as of december   and employment contracts for key employees  which are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  and contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of business  we do not have any off balance sheet financings or liabilities 
the intercompany debt between the company and the capital trust  a wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiary trust would otherwise eliminate in consolidation and the preferred stock would be included in our consolidated balance sheet 
see note to the consolidated financial statements under new accounting pronouncements 
we do not have any majority owned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements  nor do we have any interests in or relationships with any special purpose entities that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
accounting estimates our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts  program rights  barter and trade transactions  useful lives of property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  carrying value of investments  accrued liabilities  contingent liabilities  income taxes  pension benefits  and fair value of financial instruments and stock options 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
had we used different assumptions in determining our estimates  our reported results may have varied 
the different types of estimates that are required to be made by us in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements vary significantly in the level of subjectivity involved in their determination 
we have identified the estimates below as those which contain a relatively 
table of contents high level of subjectivity in their determination and therefore could have a more material effect upon our reported results if different assumptions were used 
impairment testing of intangible assets in performing our annual impairment testing of goodwill and fcc licenses  which are both considered to be intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  we must make a significant number of assumptions and estimates in applying a fair value based test 
to assist in this process  we utilize the services of an independent valuation consulting firm 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the assumptions and estimates required under the impairment testing of goodwill and fcc licenses included future market revenue growth  operating profit margins  cash flow multiples  market revenue share  and weighted average cost of capital  among others 
upon adoption of sfas on january  and again in the fourth quarters of  and  we completed an impairment review and found no impairment to the carrying value of goodwill or fcc licenses 
had we utilized either a different valuation technique or different assumptions or estimates  the carrying values of goodwill and fcc licenses as of january   december   december  and december  may have been different 
we consider the assumptions used in our impairment testing of intangible assets to be reasonable 
investment carrying values we have investments in unconsolidated affiliates  which are accounted for under the equity method if our equity interest is from to  and under the cost method if our equity interest is less than and we do not exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies 
we review the carrying value of investments on an ongoing basis and adjust them to reflect net realizable value  where necessary 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as part of our analysis and determination of the net realizable value of investments  we must make assumptions and estimates regarding expected future cash flows  which involves assessing the financial results  forecasts  and strategic direction of the investee companies 
in addition  we must make assumptions regarding discount rates  market growth rates  comparable company valuations and other factors  and the types of assumptions we must make differ according to the type of investment to be valued 
had we utilized different assumptions and estimates in our assessment of the net realizable value of investments  the carrying values of our investments as of december  may have been different 
we consider the assumptions used in our determination of investment carrying values to be reasonable 
pension assumptions in computing projected benefit obligations and the resulting pension expense  we are required to make a number of assumptions 
to assist in this process  we use the services of an independent consulting firm 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
to compute our projected benefit obligations as of the measurement date of september   we used the discount rate of and a rate of compensation increase of 
in determining the discount rate assumption of  we used a measurement date of september  and constructed a portfolio of bonds to match the benefit payment stream that is projected to be paid from the company s pension plans 
the benefit payment stream is assumed to be funded from bond coupons and maturities as well as interest on the excess cash flows from the bond portfolio 
to compute our pension expense in the year ended december   we used a discount rate of  an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of  and a rate of compensation increase of 
to determine the discount rate assumption of  we used the measurement date of september  and used the same methodology to construct a portfolio of bonds to match the projected benefit payment 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption of is based on the weighted average expected long term returns for the target allocation of plan assets as of the measurement date of september  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on management s methodology for developing the expected long term rate of return assumption 
in calculating our pension expense for the year ending december   we anticipate using an assumed expected long term rate of return of 
we consider the assumptions used in our determination of our projected benefit obligations and pension expense to be reasonable 

table of contents pension assumptions sensitivity analysis the weighted average assumptions used in computing our net pension expense and projected benefit obligation have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
a one percentage point change in each of the assumptions below would have the following effects upon net pension expense benefit and projected benefit obligation  respectively  in the year ended and as of december  one percentage point increase one percentage point decrease expected long rate of expected long rate of discount term rate of compensation discount term rate of compensation rate return increase rate return increase in thousands net pension expense benefit projected benefit obligation significant business transactions during the three year period ended december   we were involved in the following significant transactions in july  we acquired the broadcasting assets of wmtw tv  an abc affiliate serving the portland auburn  maine television market for approximately million in cash  including acquisition costs 
in december  proact technologies corporation proact sold substantially all of its operating assets to a third party as part of an overall plan of liquidation 
as a result of the sale  we wrote down our investment in proact by million to reflect the difference between the carrying value of this investment and the distribution expected to be received as a result of the sale of assets 
we originally invested million in proact  a provider of human resources and benefits management solutions for employers and health plans  on march  in march  we wrote down our investment in proact by million in order to approximate the investment s then estimated realizable value 
as this investment represents less than a interest in proact  the investment is accounted for using the cost method 
on december   we redeemed a portion of the debentures the series a debentures that we issued on december  to our wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiary  the capital trust 
we originally issued million of series a and series b debentures to the capital trust in in exchange for the proceeds of a million private placement of redeemable convertible preferred securities redeemable convertible preferred securities which the capital trust issued to institutional investors 
we redeemed the series a debentures in their entirety in the aggregate principal amount of million  at a price of per principal amount in accordance with the terms of the indenture 
the redemption of the series a debentures triggered a simultaneous redemption by the capital trust of million shares of its series a redeemable convertible preferred securities the series a securities  as well as the redemption of  shares of the capital trust s common stock  which were held by us 
the series a securities were effectively convertible  at the option of the holder  into shares of our series a common stock at a rate of shares of series a common stock per principal amount of series a debentures an effective conversion price of 
we recognized a pre tax loss of million related to the redemption premium  which is included in interest expense  net capital trust in the consolidated statement of income 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the redemption of the series a debentures will reduce interest expense  net capital trust by million per year starting in and removes the potential dilution of million shares

if events or changes in circumstances indicate a reduction in an asset s useful life  the remaining net book value of the asset is depreciated on a straight line basis over its revised useful life 
amortization was million in the year ended december   as compared to million in the year ended december   a decrease of million  principally resulting from amortization related to a separately identified intangible asset  advertiser client base 
in december  we had reclassified the remaining net book value of the advertiser client base to goodwill in the consolidated balance sheet and ceased amortization 
in december  we determined the advertiser client base should continue to be separately identified from goodwill and  as an intangible asset with a finite useful life under sfas  be amortized over its estimated useful life 
accordingly  the company recorded a catch up to amortization expense on the 
table of contents advertiser client base of million in the fourth quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements

in accordance with the adoption of sfas on january   we no longer amortize our fcc licenses  but instead test them for impairment annually 
as the tax basis in our fcc licenses continues to amortize  our deferred tax liability will increase over time 
we do not expect the significant portion of our deferred tax liability to reverse over time unless i our fcc licenses become impaired  or ii our fcc licenses are sold for cash  which would typically only occur in connection with the sale of net assets of a station or groups of stations or the entire company
