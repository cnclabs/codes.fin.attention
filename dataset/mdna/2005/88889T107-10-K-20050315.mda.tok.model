item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item of this report 
except for the historical financial information contained herein  the matters discussed below may be considered forward looking statements 
please see cautionary statement about forward looking statements  for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
overview of our business we are a leading provider of contract oil and natural gas drilling services  primarily in the united states us gulf of mexico shallow water and inland marine region  an area that we refer to as the us gulf coast 
we provide these services primarily to independent oil and natural gas companies  but we also service major international and government controlled oil and natural gas companies 
our customers in the us gulf coast typically focus on drilling for natural gas 
we provide contract oil and gas drilling and other support services and report the results of those operations in four business segments which  for our contract drilling services  correspond to the principal geographic regions in which we operate us inland barge segment our barge rig fleet currently operating in this market segment consists of conventional and posted barge rigs 
these units operate in marshes  rivers  lakes and shallow bay or coastal waterways that are known as the transition zone 
this area along the us gulf coast  where jackup rigs are unable to operate  is the world s largest market for this type of equipment 
us gulf of mexico segment we currently have jackup and three submersible rigs in the us gulf of mexico shallow water market segment which begins at the outer limit of the transition zone and extends to water depths of about feet 
our jackup rigs in this market segment consist of independent leg cantilever type units  mat supported cantilever type rigs and mat supported slot type jackup rigs that can operate in water depths up to feet 

table of contents other international segment our other operations are currently conducted in mexico  trinidad and venezuela 
in mexico  we operate two jackup rigs and a platform rig for pemex  the mexican national oil company 
additionally  we have two jackup rigs in trinidad and nine land rigs in venezuela 
from december to september  we operated a jackup rig offshore venezuela 
this rig has subsequently been relocated to the us gulf of mexico 
we may pursue selected opportunities in other regions from time to time 
delta towing segment we have a partial interest in a joint venture that operates a fleet of us marine support vessels consisting primarily of shallow water tugs  crewboats and utility barges delta towing 
we are also a substantial creditor of delta towing 
our operating revenues for our drilling segments are based on dayrates received for our drilling services and the number of operating days during the relevant periods 
the level of our operating revenues depends on dayrates  which in turn are primarily a function of industry supply and demand for drilling units in the market segments in which we operate 
supply and demand for drilling units in the us gulf coast  which is our primary operating region  have historically been volatile 
during periods of high demand  our rigs typically achieve higher utilization and dayrates than during periods of low demand 
our operating and maintenance costs for our drilling segments represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and maintenance of our drilling rigs 
the principal elements of these costs are direct and indirect labor and benefits  freight costs  repair and maintenance  insurance  general taxes and licenses  boat and helicopter rentals  communications  tool rentals and services 
labor  repair and maintenance and insurance costs represent the most significant components of our operating and maintenance costs 
operating and maintenance expenses may not necessarily fluctuate in proportion to changes in operating revenues because we generally seek to preserve crew continuity and maintain equipment when our rigs are idle 
in general  labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels  rig staffing requirements and inflation 
equipment maintenance expenses fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the unit is performing and the age and condition of the equipment 
industry background  trends and outlook the drilling industry in the us gulf coast is highly cyclical and is typically driven by general economic activity and changes in actual or anticipated oil and gas prices 
we believe that both our earnings and demand for our rigs will typically be correlated to our customers expectations of energy prices  particularly natural gas prices  and that sustained energy price increases will generally have a positive impact on our earnings 
we believe there are several trends that should benefit our operations  including redeployment of jackup rigs 
greater demand for jackup rigs in international areas over the last two years has reduced the overall supply of jackups in the us gulf of mexico 
this has created a more favorable supply environment for the remaining jackups  including ours 
this favorable supply environment has led to increased jackup dayrates 
high natural gas prices 
while us natural gas prices are volatile  the rolling twelve month average price of natural gas has increased from in january to in january we believe high natural gas prices in the united states  if sustained  should result in more exploration and development drilling activity and higher utilization and dayrates for drilling companies like us 
need for increased natural gas drilling activity 
from to  us demand for natural gas grew at an annual rate of while its supply grew at an annual rate of 
we believe that this supply and demand growth imbalance will continue if demand for natural gas continues to increase and production decline rates continue to accelerate 
even though the number of us gas wells drilled has increased overall in recent years  a corresponding increase in production has not been realized 
we believe that an increase in us drilling activity will be required for the natural gas industry to meet the expected increased demand for  and compensate for the slowing production of  natural gas in the united states 

table of contents trend towards drilling deeper shallow water gas wells 
a current trend by oil and gas companies is to drill deep gas wells along the us gulf coast in search of new and potentially prolific untapped natural gas reserves 
we believe that this trend towards deeper drilling will benefit premium jackup rigs as well as barge rigs and submersible rigs that are capable of drilling deep gas wells 
in addition  we believe this trend will indirectly benefit conventional jackup fleets as the use of premium rigs in the us gulf coast to drill deep wells should reduce the supply of rigs available to drill conventional wells 
market conditions for our us gulf coast jackup fleet improved beginning in the third quarter of and continued through as shown in the following table  from the third quarter of through the fourth quarter of  our average revenue per day for us gulf of mexico jackups and submersibles improved by 
during the same period  average revenue per day for our us inland barges improved by 
as of march   our jackup rigs working in the us gulf coast were contracted at dayrates ranging from  to  as of march   our operating inland barges were contracted at dayrates ranging from  to  we anticipate that the declining jackup rig supply in the us gulf coast and the trend towards more deep gas well drilling will continue to result in improved utilization and higher dayrates 
with respect to our venezuelan operations  political unrest has continued to negatively impact our results of operations there 
as a result  we experienced some decline in utilization in venezuela during the second half of and throughout in january  we hired simmons company international to explore alternatives for the disposition of our venezuelan land drilling business  which is not viewed by us as being core to our ongoing offshore drilling business 
the evaluation may result in the sale of some or all of our venezuelan assets 
the following table shows our average rig revenue per day and utilization for the quarterly periods ended on or prior to december  with respect to each of our three drilling segments 
average rig revenue per day is defined as operating revenue earned per revenue earning day in the period 
utilization in the table below is defined as the total actual number of revenue earning days in the period as a percentage of the total number of calendar days in the period for all drilling rigs in our fleet  as adjusted to include calendar days available for rigs that were held for sale during the periods ended on or prior to december  three months ended december  march  june  september  december  march  june  september  december  average rig revenue per day us gulf of mexico jackups and submersibles us inland barges other international utilization us gulf of mexico jackups and submersibles us inland barges other international in the third quarter of  we were awarded contracts with pemex  the mexican national oil company  for two of our jackup rigs and a platform rig 
after upgrades to comply with contract specifications  one rig began operating on a day contract in early november at a contract dayrate of approximately  the other jackup rig began operating in early december on a  day contract at a contract dayrate of approximately  the cost to prepare the two jackup rigs to work in mexico  including mobilization costs  which are deferred and will be recognized over the primary contract term  was approximately million in the aggregate 
the platform rig contract is  days in duration and began operating in december at a contract dayrate of approximately  our platform rig was upgraded to 
table of contents comply with pemex contract specifications at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
each of the contracts can be terminated by pemex on five days notice  subject to certain conditions 
in the third quarter of  two of our land rigs began working in venezuela under one year term contracts at dayrates of  and  and another two land rigs were re deployed during october and november under one year contracts with petroleos de venezuela pdvsa  the venezuelan national oil company  at contract dayrates of approximately  each 
our jackup rig  the which began operating in venezuela in mid december  completed its contract in september and has been relocated to the us gulf of mexico 
prior to october  our principal insurance coverages for property damage  liability and occupational injury and illness were included in transocean s insurance program in accordance with the master separation agreement 
effective october   we changed our insurance program to an independent  stand alone insurance program  that provides for significantly lower deductibles than those in our previous insurance program 
our current deductible level under the new hull and machinery and protection and indemnity policies is million and million per occurrence  respectively 
previously  our deductible level under each of these policies was million per occurrence 
insurance premiums under the new program will be approximately million for the twelve month policy period  or approximately million higher than those under the previous program with transocean 
we expect that the increased premium cost will be more than offset by the benefit of the lower deductibles  primarily with respect to hull and machinery claims 
ipo and separation from transocean we were incorporated in delaware on july  as r b falcon corporation 
on january   we became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of transocean as a result of the merger transaction between us and transocean the transocean merger 
the merger was accounted for as a purchase  with transocean as the accounting acquirer 
accordingly  the purchase price was allocated to our assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values as of january  with the excess accounted for as goodwill 
the purchase price adjustments were pushed down to our consolidated financial statements  which affects the comparability of the consolidated financial statements for periods before and after the merger 
accordingly  the financial statements for the periods ended on or before january  were prepared using our historical basis of accounting and the financial statements for the periods subsequent to january  include the effects of the merger 
on december   we changed our name from r b falcon corporation to todco 
in july  transocean announced plans to divest its gulf of mexico shallow and inland water shallow water business through an initial public offering of todco common stock 
during  we completed the transfer to transocean of all assets not related to our shallow water business transocean assets  including the transfer of all revenue producing transocean assets 
accordingly  the transocean assets and related operations have been reflected as discontinued operations in our historical financial statements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
in february  we completed our initial public offering in which transocean sold  shares of our class a common stock the ipo 
secondary stock offerings were completed in september and december where transocean sold an additional  and  shares  respectively  of todco class a common stock 
at the closing of the december stock offering  transocean converted all of its unsold shares of class b common stock into an equal number of shares of class a common stock 
as a result of the above transactions  at december   transocean owns  shares or approximately percent of the outstanding class a common stock of the company 
as a result of the conversion  no class b common stock is outstanding as of december  the company received no proceeds from the ipo or the secondary stock offerings 
effective february   transocean notified us of its election to request us to file a shelf registration statement on form s to register the resale of up to  shares of our class a common stock by transocean on a delayed or continuous basis under rule of the securities act of  as amended  pursuant to the registration rights agreement between todco and transocean 
the company will receive no proceeds from the sale of these securities 

table of contents prior to the ipo  we entered into several agreements with transocean defining the terms of the separation of our business from the business of transocean 
these agreements included a master separation agreement which defined our two businesses and provided for allocations of responsibilities and rights in connection therewith  a tax sharing agreement which allocated certain rights and responsibilities with respect to pre and post ipo taxes  a registration rights agreement pursuant to which we are required to file registration statements to assist transocean in selling its shares of our common stock  an employee matters agreement which governed the application of the separation of our employees from transocean and its benefit plans and a transition services agreement under which transocean provided certain services to us during the initial phases of our separation from transocean 
changes in results of operations related to our separation from transocean as a result of our separation from transocean  including the transfer of the transocean assets to transocean in and the completion of our ipo in february  our reporting of certain aspects of our results of operations differs from our historical reporting of results of operations 
the following discussion describes these and other differences 
general and administrative expense includes costs related to our corporate executives  corporate accounting and reporting  engineering  health  safety and environment  information technology  marketing  operations management  legal  tax  treasury  risk management and human resource functions 
prior to june  and the transfer of the transocean assets to transocean  general and administrative expense also included an allocation from transocean for certain administrative support 
after june   general and administrative expense includes costs for services provided to us under our transition services agreement with transocean 
in addition  we are incurring additional general and administrative expense associated with the vesting of stock options and restricted stock granted in conjunction with the ipo 
in february  we adopted a long term incentive plan for certain of our employees and non employee directors in order to provide additional incentives through the grant of awards the plan 
in conjunction with the closing of the ipo  we granted restricted stock and stock options to certain employees and non employee directors 
additional awards were made during the year 
based upon the price per share at date of issuance  the value of these awards that we will recognize as compensation expense is approximately million 
we recognized million of compensation expense related to these awards and grants during we will amortize the remaining million to compensation expense over the vesting period of the awards and options 
in addition to these grants under the plan  we expect to make additional grants of restricted stock and stock options annually 
the value of any additional awards under the plan will be recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the awards 
in addition  certain of our employees held options to acquire transocean ordinary shares that were granted prior to the ipo 
in accordance with the employee matters agreement  the employees holding such options were treated as terminated for the convenience of transocean on the ipo date 
as a result  these options became fully vested and were modified to remain exercisable over the original contractual life 
in connection with the modification of the options  we recognized million in additional compensation expense in the first quarter of no further compensation expense will be recognized related to the transocean options 
interest income consists of interest earned on our cash balances and  for periods before december   on notes receivable from delta towing 
because of the adoption of the financial accounting standards board s fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
fin see relationships with variable interest entities  and the resulting consolidation of delta towing in our consolidated balance sheet effective december   we expect future interest income to consist of interest earned on our cash balances 
for periods before the ipo  interest expense consisted of financing cost amortization and interest associated with our senior notes  other debt and other related party debt as described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
after the closing of the ipo  interest expense primarily includes interest on the approximately million face value of our senior notes payable to third parties  commitment fees on the unused portion of 
table of contents our line of credit and the amortization of financing costs 
our debt levels and  correspondingly  our interest expense were substantially lower in compared to prior years as a result of the notes payable to transocean prior to the ipo 
in conjunction with the ipo  we entered into a tax sharing agreement with transocean whereby transocean will indemnify todco against substantially all pre ipo income tax liabilities 
however  we must pay transocean for substantially all pre closing income tax benefits utilized subsequent to the closing of the ipo 
as of december   we had approximately million of estimated pre closing income tax benefits subject to this obligation to reimburse transocean of which approximately million of the tax benefits were reflected in our historical financial statements at december  the additional estimated tax benefits resulted from the closing of the ipo  specified ownership changes  statutory allocations of tax benefits among transocean s consolidated group members and other events 
the estimated pre closing tax benefits and our corresponding obligation to transocean may change when transocean actually files its consolidated group tax return in as part of the tax sharing agreement  we must pay transocean for substantially all pre closing income tax benefits which we may utilize or be deemed to have utilized subsequent to the closing of the ipo 
accordingly  we recorded an equity transaction in to eliminate the valuation allowance associated with the pre closing tax benefits and reflect the associated liability to transocean for the pre closing tax benefits as a corresponding obligation within the deferred income tax asset accounts 
the net effect was a million reduction in additional paid in capital 
in addition  transocean agreed to indemnify us for certain tax liabilities that existed as of the ipo date  which are currently estimated to be million 
the tax indemnification by transocean was recorded as a credit to additional paid in capital with a corresponding offset to a related party receivable from transocean 
we are currently in a net tax liability position for the year ended december  and expect to utilize a portion of the pre closing income tax benefits to offset our federal income tax obligation 
as of december   we have utilized million of these pre closing income tax benefits to offset our current federal income tax obligation resulting in a liability to transocean of million 
additionally in  we utilized pre closing state tax benefits resulting in a liability to transocean of million 
both of these liabilities are presented within accrued income taxes related party in our consolidated balance sheet at december  additionally  the tax sharing agreement provides that if any person other than transocean or its subsidiaries becomes the beneficial owner of greater than of the total voting power of our outstanding voting stock  we will be deemed to have utilized all of these pre closing tax benefits  and we will be required to pay transocean an amount for the deemed utilization of these tax benefits adjusted by a specified discount factor 
this payment is required even if we are unable to utilize the pre closing tax benefits 
if an acquisition of beneficial ownership had occurred on december   the estimated amount that the company would have been required to pay transocean would have been approximately million  or of the pre closing tax benefits at december  in  this percentage of remaining pre closing tax benefits that would be payable to transocean upon a change of beneficial ownership is reduced to 
we had an ownership change for purposes of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  in connection with our secondary offering in september as a result  our ability to utilize certain of our tax benefits is subject to an annual limitation 
however  we believe that  in light of the amount of the annual limitation  it should not have a material effect on our ability to utilize these tax benefits for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  operating revenues  expenses 
table of contents and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  materials and supplies obsolescence  investments  property  equipment and other long lived assets  income taxes  workers injury claims  employment benefits and contingent liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies 
these policies require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment 
our property and equipment represent approximately of our total assets as of december  we determine the carrying value of these assets based on our property and equipment accounting policies  which incorporate our estimates  assumptions and judgments relative to capitalized costs  useful lives and salvage values of our rigs 
we review our property and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets or asset groups may be impaired or when reclassifications are made between property and equipment and assets held for sale as prescribed by the fasb s statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
asset impairment evaluations are based on estimated undiscounted cash flows for the assets being evaluated 
our estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the application of our property and equipment accounting policies reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations 
using different estimates  assumptions and judgments  especially those involving the useful lives of our rigs and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations  would result in different carrying values of assets and results of operations 
for example  a prolonged downturn in the drilling industry in which utilization and dayrates were significantly reduced could result in an impairment of the carrying value of our drilling rigs 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish reserves for doubtful accounts on a case by case basis when we believe the collection of specific amounts owed to us is unlikely to occur 
our operating revenues are principally derived from services to us independent oil and natural gas companies and international and government controlled oil companies and our receivables are concentrated in the united states 
we generally do not require collateral or other security to support customer receivables 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  we may be required to establish additional reserves 
provision for income taxes 
our tax provision is based on expected taxable income  statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws 
our effective tax rate is expected to fluctuate from year to year as our operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions and the amount of pre tax income fluctuates 
currently payable income tax expense represents either nonresident withholding taxes or the liabilities expected to be reflected on our income tax returns for the current year while the net deferred tax expense or benefit represents the changes in the balance of deferred tax assets and liabilities as reported on the balance sheet 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future 
while we have considered estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowances  changes in these estimates and assumptions  as well as changes in tax laws  could require us to adjust the valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets 
these adjustments to the valuation allowance would impact our income tax provision in the period in which such adjustments are identified and recorded 
contingent liabilities 
we establish reserves for estimated loss contingencies when we believe a loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss 
revisions to contingent liabilities are reflected in income in the period in which different facts or information become known or circumstances change that affect our previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss 
reserves for contingent liabilities are based upon our assumptions and estimates regarding the probable outcome of the 
table of contents matter 
should the outcome differ from our assumptions and estimates  we would make revisions to the estimated reserves for contingent liabilities  and such revisions could be material

our consolidated results of operations for the year ended december  reflect the consolidation of our ownership interest in delta towing effective december  in accordance with fin accordingly  our results for include revenues and expenses for delta towing 
prior to the adoption of fin  we recorded our interest in the results of delta towing as equity in income loss of joint venture in our consolidated statements of operations and also recognized interest income related party related to delta towing s notes payable to us 
see relationships with variable interest entities for a discussion of the effects of fin on our investment in delta towing 
years ended december  and revenues 
total revenues increased million  or  during as compared to the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to higher overall average rig revenue per day earned in  and the inclusion of revenues from the operation of delta towing s fleet of marine support vessels 
overall average rig revenue per day increased from  for to  for the increase in average rig revenue per day reflects the continued improvement of market conditions in the us gulf coast  as well as the addition of two of our jackup rigs which began operating offshore mexico in late and a jackup rig that recently completed its contract offshore venezuela 
average rig utilization of for is up slightly from average rig utilization in the increased utilization is principally due to a decrease in total available rig operating days in the period as a result of the removal of five jackup rigs from drilling service in the second quarter of  partially offset by the effect of lower land rig utilization in venezuela during 
table of contents revenues for our us gulf of mexico segment increased million  or  during as compared to in  we achieved higher average rig revenue per day for our jackup and submersible drilling fleet as a result of our success in obtaining contracts with our customers at higher dayrates in response to increased market demand and decreased jackup drilling rig supply in the us gulf of mexico 
average revenue per day increased to  for  up from  for  which resulted in an additional million in operating revenues for as compared to results for also reflect higher utilization for our current rig fleet in this market  after giving effect to the transfers of the jackup drilling units the  the and the to our other international segment in the fourth quarter of this increase in utilization resulted in million in additional rig revenues in as compared to the drilling units transferred to our other international segment generated revenues of million in revenues for our us inland barge segment increased million  or  in as compared to  primarily due to higher average rig revenue per day 
average rig revenue per day increased from  for to  for  as a result of our successful marketing efforts in negotiating higher dayrates for our fleet of inland barges during the increase in average rig revenue per day resulted in additional revenues of million for as compared to this market has continued to improve in resulting in improved utilization of our inland barge fleet compared to utilization levels experienced beginning in the last half of utilization of our inland barge fleet was for  as compared to for  which resulted in a million increase in operating revenues in revenues for our other international segment were million for the million  or  increase over operating revenues for reflects the operation of two of our jackup rigs  the and the  which began working offshore mexico in late under long term contracts and the operation of the  which began operating under a multi well contract with conocophillips in late december the operation of these rigs in contributed an additional million in operating revenues during the favorable contribution by these jackup rigs was partially offset by lower utilization for our land rigs in venezuela and a platform rig in trinidad that completed its contract in the third quarter of the lower utilization for our land rigs in venezuela resulted in a million decrease in operating revenues for as compared to our platform rig  which was operating in trinidad until the third quarter of  generated million of operating revenues in our revenues for included million related to the operation of delta towing s fleet of us marine support vessels 
operating and maintenance expenses 
total operating and maintenance expenses increased million  or  in as compared to operating expenses of million for a decrease in operating expenses for our us gulf of mexico and inland barge segments was offset by higher operating expenses in our other international segment  primarily as a result of the three additional jackup rigs working in international locations in and the inclusion of million in operating expenses related to delta towing 
the decrease in operating expenses for our domestic segments for as compared to  is primarily due to the transfer of three jackup drilling rigs from the us gulf of mexico to international locations  the absence of one time charges related to a well control incident and a fire on two of our barge rigs and an insurance provision for damages sustained to the mat finger on one of our jackup rigs in operating costs for our us gulf of mexico segment declined million  or  in as compared to  primarily due to the transfer of three of our jackup rigs to locations in mexico and venezuela in the fourth quarter of million and an insurance provision in for damages sustained to one of our jackup rigs million 
these favorable variances in operating costs were partly offset by higher costs for maintenance of our jackup rig fleet in the us gulf of mexico million  increased labor costs million  higher reimbursable mobilization costs million  and increased personnel related charges for labor and health benefits claims million in as compared to operating and maintenance expenses for our us inland barge segment were million for as compared to million for our results for included one time charges of million and million related to a june well control incident on rig and a september fire on rig  respectively 
the further decrease in operating expenses for this segment in as compared to  was 
table of contents due primarily to lower operating costs related to support vessels and other equipment rentals million  lower write downs of other receivables million and lower personal injury claims million 
these favorable decreases were partly offset by million in higher maintenance costs in operating costs for our other international segment for increased million as compared to  primarily due to million of additional operating expenses as a result of our jackup drilling operations in mexico 
operating expenses in also included million of costs related to the operation of the offshore venezuela through the third quarter of our results for this segment in included million of additional operating costs related to our platform rig in trinidad  which completed its contract in the third quarter of our platform rig began operating under a new contract in mexico in late december general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for as compared to million for the million increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to the inclusion of million of stock compensation expense associated with post ipo grants of stock options and restricted stock awards  million in stock compensation expense related to the modification of transocean stock options held by some of our employees  million in general and administrative expenses for delta towing and million in higher other overhead costs  primarily related to corporate insurance policies and professional fees 
these unfavorable variances in general and administrative expenses in  as compared to  were partly offset by lower administrative charges of million for under our transition services agreement with transocean  which became effective in the third quarter of see related party transactions allocation of administrative costs 
impairment loss on long lived assets 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million non cash impairment charge related to our decision to decommission our three venezuelan lake barges and to salvage any remaining useable equipment 
during the second quarter of  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million resulting from our decision to take five jackup rigs out of drilling service and market the rigs for alternative uses 
we do not anticipate returning these rigs to drilling service  as we believe it would be cost prohibitive to do so 
in conjunction with these decisions  and in accordance with sfas  the carrying value of these assets was adjusted to fair market value 
the fair market value of the drilling equipment on board the lake barges and the non drilling rigs was primarily based on third party valuations 
additionally in the second quarter of  we recorded a million non cash impairment resulting from our determination that assets of entities in which we had an investment did not support our recorded investment 
the impairment was determined and measured based upon the remaining book value of the assets and our assessment of the fair value at the time the decision was made 
in december  we received million in proceeds from certain assets sold by the entities  which was recorded as a reduction to the impairment charge 
the entities were liquidated in early gain on disposal of assets  net 
during  we realized gains on disposal of assets of million  primarily related to the sale of six marine support vessels by delta towing million  the settlement of an october insurance claim for one of our jackup rigs million  and sales and disposals of used drill pipe million 
net gains losses on disposal of assets were not significant in interest expense 
third party interest expense and interest expense related party decreased million in as compared to  primarily due to lower debt balances owed to third parties and transocean  partly offset by million in bank commitment fees related to our million line of credit entered into in december in  we repaid million of third party debt and  in conjunction with the transfer of the transocean assets  we retired million in related party debt payable to transocean 
additionally  prior to the closing of our ipo  we completed a debt for equity exchange of all our remaining outstanding related party debt payable to transocean 
loss on retirement of debt 
in conjunction with the retirement of debt held by transocean in  we recorded losses on retirement of related party debt in of million 
in the first quarter of  we wrote off the remaining balance of unamortized fees of approximately million associated with the exchange of transocean debt for our outstanding senior notes in march due to the retirement of the debt in conjunction with the ipo

based on cash flow projections and industry conditions  we recorded a million impairment of our notes receivable from delta towing during the second quarter of see relationships with variable interest entities 
other  net 
other expense  net was million for  including a million loss on revaluation of our local currency in venezuela 
in january  venezuela implemented foreign exchange controls that limited our ability to convert local currency into us dollars and transfer excess funds out of venezuela 
the exchange controls caused an artificially high value to be placed on the local currency 
as a result  we recognized a loss on revaluation of the local currency into functional us dollars during the second quarter of in  other income  net included million in foreign currency exchange gains 
income tax benefit 
the income tax benefit of million for reflects an effective tax rate etr of  as compared to million for  based on an etr of 
the increased etr is primarily the result of providing a valuation allowance on net operating losses generated in during  we recorded a valuation allowance on net operating loss carry forwards and foreign tax credits generated during the year 
in  to the extent we utilized net operating losses carry forwards nol s to reduce taxable income  we owe transocean for the utilization of these nol s  in accordance with the tax sharing agreement

from time to time  we may also make use of our revolving line of credit for cash liquidity 
in december  we entered into a two year million floating rate secured revolving credit facility that declined to million in december there were no amounts outstanding under this credit facility at december  and the facility is secured by most of our drilling rigs  our receivables  and the stock of most of our us subsidiaries and is guaranteed by some of our subsidiaries

in the third quarter of  we entered into an unsecured line of credit with a bank in venezuela that provides for a maximum of million venezuela bolivars million us dollars at the current exchange rate at december  in order to establish a source of local currency to meet our current obligations in venezuela bolivars 
each draw on the line of credit is denominated in venezuela bolivars and is evidenced by a day promissory note that bears interest at the then market rate as designated by the bank 
the promissory notes are pre payable at any time 
however  if not repaid within days  the promissory notes automatically renew for an additional day period at the then designated interest rate 
there are no commitment fees payable on the unused portion of the line of credit  and the facility is terminable at will by the bank

our rigs requiring substantial refurbishment to be ready for service are noted in the tables in business drilling rig fleet 
from time to time we may review possible acquisitions of drilling rigs or businesses  joint ventures  mergers or other business combinations and may in the future make significant capital commitments for such purposes 
any such transactions could involve the issuance of a substantial number of additional shares or other securities or the payment by us of a substantial amount of cash 
we would likely fund the cash portion  if any  of such transactions through cash balances on hand  the incurrence of additional debt  sales of assets  shares or other securities or a combination thereof 
in addition  from time to time we may consider dispositions of drilling rigs 
our ability to fund capital expenditures would be adversely affected if conditions deteriorate in our business  we experience poor results in our operations or we fail to meet covenants under the revolving credit facility described above 
we anticipate that our available funds  together with our cash generated from operations and amounts that we may borrow  will be sufficient to fund our required capital expenditures  working capital and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
future cash flows and the availability of outside funding sources  however  are subject to a number of uncertainties  especially the condition of the oil and natural gas industry

if one enterprise absorbs a majority of a vie s expected losses and another enterprise receives a majority of that entity s expected residual returns  the enterprise absorbing a majority of the expected losses is required to consolidate the vie and will be deemed the primary beneficiary for accounting purposes 
under fin  delta towing is considered a vie because its equity is not sufficient to absorb the joint venture s expected future losses

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the table below presents scheduled debt maturities and related weighted average interest rates for each of the years ending december  relating to debt obligations as of december  scheduled maturity date fair value at december  thereafter total in millions  except interest rate percentages total debt fixed rate a average interest rate a expected maturity amounts are based on the face value of debt and do not reflect fair market value of debt 
at december   we had no variable rate debt outstanding and as such interest expense had no exposure to changes in interest rates 
however  a large part of our cash investments would earn commensurately higher rates of return if interest rates increase 
using december  cash investment levels  a one percent increase in interest rates would result in approximately million of additional interest income per year 
foreign exchange risk our international operations in mexico  trinidad and venezuela expose us to foreign exchange risk 
we use a variety of techniques to minimize the exposure to foreign exchange risk 
our primary foreign exchange risk management strategy involves structuring customer contracts to provide for payment in both us dollars and local currency 
the payment portion denominated in local currency is based on anticipated local currency requirements over the contract term 
we may also use foreign exchange derivative instruments or spot purchases 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
at december   we did not have any outstanding foreign exchange contracts 
in january  venezuela implemented foreign exchange controls that limited our ability to convert local currency into us dollars and transfer excess funds out of venezuela 
prior to august  our drilling contracts in venezuela typically called for payments to be made in local currency  even when the dayrate is 
table of contents denominated in us dollars 
in august  we negotiated an agreement with our principal customer in venezuela to pay the majority of the us dollar denominated amounts in us dollars to one of our banks in the united states 
the exchange controls could also result in an artificially high value being placed on the local currency 
in the second quarter of  we established a currency valuation allowance of million pertaining to cash and receivables in venezuela in order to adjust our venezuelan financial assets to net realizable value as of june  this valuation allowance was deemed necessary due to the continuing political instability in venezuela and the continuation of foreign exchange controls  which limit our ability to convert local currency into us dollars and transfer excess funds out of venezuela 
in september  we reversed million of the currency valuation allowance that was no longer deemed necessary due to a sustained decrease in the net carrying value of assets denominated in the local currency in  primarily as a result of an agreement with our primary customer in venezuela to pay the majority of the us dollar denominated accounts receivable in us dollars to one of our banks in the united states 
on march   venezuela increased the official exchange rate from  bolivars us dollar to  bolivars us dollar 
we do not anticipate that this change in exchange rate will have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition or cash flows
