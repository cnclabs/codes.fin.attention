unless the context otherwise requires  g iii  us  we and our refer to g iii apparel group  ltd 
and its subsidiaries 
references to fiscal years refer to the year ended or ending on january of that year 
for example  our fiscal year ended january  is referred to as fiscal the following presentation of management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements  the accompanying notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview g iii designs  manufactures  imports and markets an extensive range of outerwear and sportswear including coats  jackets  pants  skirts  handbags and other sportswear items under licensed labels  our own proprietary labels and private retail labels 
our products are distributed through a broad mix of retail partners at a variety of price points 
we sell to approximately  retail customers in the united states  including most major department stores  mass merchants and specialty retail stores 
our largest customer is wal mart stores inc sales to two of wal mart s retail chains represented approximately of our net sales in fiscal no other customer represented more than of our net sales in fiscal we operate in fashion markets that are intensely competitive 
our ability to continuously evaluate and respond to changing consumer demands and tastes  across multiple market segments  distribution channels and geographies is critical to our success 
although our portfolio of brands is aimed at diversifying our risks in this regard  misjudging shifts in consumer preferences could have a negative effect on our business 
our success in the future will depend on our ability to design products that are accepted in the markets we serve  source the manufacture of our products on a competitive basis  particularly in light of the impact of the recent elimination of quota for apparel products  and continue to diversify our product portfolio and the markets we serve 
we operate our business in two segments  licensed apparel and non licensed apparel 
the licensed apparel segment includes sales of apparel brands licensed by us from third parties 
the non licensed apparel segment includes sales of apparel under our own brands and private label brands  as well as commission fee income received on sales that are financed by and shipped directly to our customers 
the sale of licensed product has been a key element of our business strategy for many years 
as part of this strategy  we added several new fashion and sports apparel licenses in the past year 
we believe that consumers prefer to buy brands they know and we have continually sought licenses that would increase the portfolio of name brands we can offer through different tiers of retail distribution and at a variety of price points 
as a result  the sale of licensed product accounted for of our net sales in fiscal compared to of our net sales in fiscal and of our net sales in fiscal we continue to believe that brand owners will look to consolidate the number of licensees they engage to develop product and they will continue to look for licensees with a successful track record of developing brands 
we are continually entering into discussions with licensors regarding new opportunities 
we believe that we have expanded our product capability offerings within outerwear fabrications 
this expansion of our product offerings has enabled us the shift over the last several years from having leather apparel constituting a significant majority of our sales to non leather apparel constituting approximately of our net sales in fiscal recent significant trends that are affecting the apparel industry include a desire on the part of retailers to consolidate vendors supplying them and a shift in consumer shopping preferences away from traditional department stores to other mid tier and specialty store venues 
there has also been significant downward pressure on average retail prices for many categories of apparel 
we have responded to these trends by continuing to focus on selling products with recognized brand equity  by attention to design  quality and value and by improving our sourcing capabilities 
we believe that our broad distribution capabilities help us to respond to the various shifts by consumers between distribution channels 
we also believe that our operational capabilities will enable us to continue to be a vendor of choice for our retail partners 
on january   the world trade organization lifted all quotas on apparel and textiles 
as a result  all textile apparel manufactured in a member nation that is exported on or after january  will no longer be subject to quota restrictions 
this will allow retailers  apparel firms and others to import unlimited quantities of apparel and textile items from china  india and other countries where manufacturing costs are low 
the effects of this action could lead to lower production costs or allow us to improve the quality of our products for a given cost 
it could also increase price competition and pricing pressure in the marketplace 
litigation and political activity has been initiated by interested parties seeking to re impose quotas 
as a result  we are unable to predict the effects of the lifting of quota restrictions and related events on our results of operations 
in september  we committed to attempt to sell our interest in a joint venture which operated a factory located in china 
as a result of that decision  we recorded a non cash charge of  that was reflected in our results of operations for the three months ended july  in january  we sold our interest in this joint venture for  the sale proceeds approximate the carrying value of this investment after the charge that was taken 
we expect to continue to source product through this factory 
in february  we extended the lease on our distribution center through february as part of the agreement  we also leased approximately  square feet of adjacent space in the existing facility through the same date at a comparable cost 
the additional space will be used for product distribution 
we obtained the additional space to reduce our reliance on third party warehouses and accommodate the additional volume we anticipate being generated from newly signed licenses 
we expect the construction cost  which includes renovations to the existing space and the additional space  will be approximately million 
we have undertaken certain initiatives to improve our operating efficiency 
we believe that relocating our foreign offices to china from korea will improve and quicken communication with the factories we use and improve our sourcing capabilities 
we also anticipate that  in addition to operational efficiencies  the cost to operate these offices will be reduced after we complete the closing of our korean offices 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant accounting policies employed by us  including the use of estimates  are presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and our results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting estimates  discussed below  pertain to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  inventories and income taxes 
in determining these estimates  management must use amounts that are based upon its informed judgments and best estimates 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer allowances and discounts  product returns  bad debts and inventories 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition we recognize a sale at the time merchandise is shipped to the customer 
we also act as an agent in brokering sales between our customers and overseas factories 
on these transactions  we recognize commission fee income on the sales that are financed by and shipped directly to our customers 
this income is also recorded at the time the merchandise is shipped 
net sales take into account reserves for returns and allowances 
we estimate the amount of reserves and allowances based on current and historical information and trends 
sales are reported net of returns  discounts and allowances 
discounts  allowances and estimates of future returns are recognized when the related revenues are recognized 
accounts receivable in the normal course of business  we extend credit to our customers based on pre defined credit criteria 
accounts receivable  as shown on our consolidated balance sheet  are net of allowances and anticipated discounts 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or substantial downgrading of credit sources  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected 
for all other customers  an allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessments of collectability based on historical trends and an evaluation of the impact of economic conditions 
an allowance for discounts is based on reviews of open invoices where concessions have been extended to customers 
costs associated with allowable deductions for customer advertising expenses are charged to advertising expenses in the selling  general and administrative section of our consolidated statements of income 
costs associated with markdowns and other operational charge backs  net of historical recoveries  are included as a reduction of net sales 
all of these are part of the allowances included in accounts receivable 
we reserve against known charge backs  as well as for an estimate of potential future deductions by customers 
these provisions result from seasonal negotiations with our customers as well as historical deduction trends  net of historical recoveries and the evaluation of current market conditions 
inventories inventories are stated at lower of cost determined by the first in  first out method or market 
we continually evaluate the composition of our inventories  assessing slow turning  ongoing product as well as fashion product from prior seasons 
the market value of distressed inventory is based on historical sales trends of our individual product lines  the impact of market trends and economic conditions  and the value of current orders for this type of inventory 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected operating data as a percentage of our net sales for the fiscal years indicated below

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk impact of inflation and foreign exchange our results of operations for the periods discussed have not been significantly affected by inflation or foreign currency fluctuation 
we negotiate our purchase orders with foreign manufacturers in united states dollars 
thus  notwithstanding any fluctuation in foreign currencies  our cost for any purchase order is not subject to change after the time the order is placed 
however  if the value of the united states dollar against local currencies were to decrease  manufacturers might increase their united states dollar prices for products 
we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our costs and net revenues during the past three years 
interest rate exposure we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates relating primarily to our line of credit 
we borrow under the line of credit to support general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures and working capital needs 
all of our debt is short term with variable rates 
we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a material adverse effect on income or cash flows in fiscal based on our average borrowings during fiscal  we estimate that each basis point increase in our borrowing rates would result in additional interest expense of approximately
