item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of this financial review is to explain changes in operating results and financial condition from to and to discuss business trends and uncertainties that might affect nicor 
certain terms used herein are defined in the glossary on page ii 
the discussion is organized into five sections summary  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity  critical accounting estimates and other factors that may affect business performance 
summary nicor inc nicor is a holding company with two principal business segments gas distribution and shipping 
nicor gas is one of the nation s largest natural gas distribution companies  and it is nicor s primary business 
tropical shipping is a containerized shipping business serving the bahamas and the caribbean region that typically represents most of the balance of nicor s operating income 
nicor also owns or has equity interests in several energy related businesses 
net income and diluted earnings per common share are presented below in millions  except per share data income before cumulative effect of accounting change net income earnings per average share of common stock diluted before cumulative effect of accounting change diluted after cumulative effect of accounting change net income was lower in compared with due in large part to a million pretax litigation charge recorded in the first quarter of related to an agreement to settle securities class action lawsuits

results for were also impacted by lower operating results in the gas distribution segment and an absence of gains that occurred in related to the company s previously written off investment in nicor energy 
partially offsetting these negative factors were higher operating results in the shipping segment and at nicor s other energy ventures  a decrease in the effective income tax rate  and the absence of a cumulative effect loss that occurred in due to a change in accounting method at nicor enerchange 
net income was lower in compared with due primarily to lower operating results from the gas distribution segment  the cumulative effect of a change in accounting methods and an increase in the effective income tax rate 
these factors were partially offset by improved equity investment results due primarily to cash received from the previously written off investment in nicor energy 
operating results of the gas distribution business were positively impacted in and by the recognition of recoveries from insurers and contractors and or reserve reductions for nicor gas mercury inspection and repair program 
the recognition of net recoveries from insurers and contractors and or reserve reductions increased pretax income by million and million in and  respectively

these negative factors were partially offset by an increase in gains on property sales million and the impact of an increased number of customers million 
gas distribution operating income decreased million in as compared to due primarily to increased operating and maintenance expenses million  lower chicago hub results million  higher depreciation million and lower property sale gains million 
operating income also reflects million of mercury related insurance recoveries in as compared to million of mercury related insurance recoveries and reserve reductions in the impact of weather colder than the prior year was an increase in operating income of about million 
nicor inc page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued o shipping operating income for increased million compared to due to increased revenues million driven by the impact of higher volumes shipped and higher average rates  partially offset by lower charter income and increased operating expenses million  primarily voyage  inland transportation  port and other costs 
shipping operating income for rose million compared to due to increased revenues from higher volumes shipped million  higher average rates million and increased charter income million 
these improvements were largely offset by higher fuel costs million as well as higher other operating expenses million in o operating income from nicor s other energy ventures for increased million compared to due primarily to higher operating results at nicor enerchange million and at nicor s energy related products and services businesses million  and the absence of prior year losses from former business activities million

operating income from nicor s other energy ventures for increased million compared to operating results were higher in nicor s energy related products and services businesses million 
also favorably impacting the year was the absence of project losses  as occurred in  on former energy system development activities million 
o the increase in operating loss at corporate is due primarily to the litigation charge of million relating to the settlement of the securities class action lawsuits 
these factors are discussed in more detail in the results of operations section 
results of operations details of various financial and operating information by segment can be found in the tables throughout this review 
the following discussion summarizes the major items impacting nicor s operating income 
operating revenues 
operating revenues by major business segment are presented below in millions gas distribution    shipping other energy ventures corporate and eliminations gas distribution revenues are impacted by changes in natural gas costs  which are passed directly through to customers without markup  subject to icc review 
for the year  gas distribution revenues increased million as compared to due primarily to higher natural gas costs million and higher revenue taxes million 
these positive factors were largely offset by the negative effect of warmer weather than in approximately million 
nicor inc page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued gas distribution revenues increased nearly percent in compared to due primarily to higher natural gas costs  which are passed directly through to customers without markup  subject to icc review 
the revenue effect of higher natural gas costs was approximately million 
revenues also increased in by about million due to colder weather than the prior year 
while residential deliveries rose on colder weather  industrial deliveries fell due largely to lower power generation load affected by mild summer weather 
in  shipping segment operating revenues increased over due primarily to higher volumes shipped million and higher average rates million  partially offset by decreased charter income million 
these higher volumes reflect increased tourism and post hurricane construction activity in the caribbean region and the bahamas 
rates were higher due to a general rate increase and higher cost recovery surcharges for fuel and security 
in  shipping segment operating revenues increased over due primarily to higher volumes shipped million  higher average rates million and increased charter income million 
the higher volumes reflect increased activity resulting from an acquisition that occurred in april the increase in revenues for other energy ventures was due primarily to higher revenues at nicor s energy related products and services businesses million  and nicor enerchange million 
the improvements were due predominantly to an increased average number of utility bill management customers at nicor solutions and related risk management activities handled by nicor enerchange instead of by an outside party 
the increase in revenues for other energy ventures was due primarily to the company s energy related products and services businesses million  largely reflecting new customers and products  such as utility bill management products introduced in negatively impacting were decreased revenues from nicor s former energy system development activities million 
corporate and eliminations primarily reflects the elimination of gas distribution revenues against nicor solutions expenses for customers purchasing the utility bill management products 
gas distribution margin 
nicor utilizes a measure it refers to as gas distribution margin to evaluate the operating income impact of gas distribution revenues 
gas distribution revenues include natural gas costs  which are passed directly through to customers without markup  subject to icc review  and revenue taxes  for which nicor gas earns a small administrative fee 
these items often cause significant fluctuations in gas distribution revenues  and yet they have virtually no direct impact on gas distribution operating income 
a reconciliation of gas distribution revenues and margin follows in millions gas distribution revenues    cost of gas   revenue tax expense gas distribution margin for the year  gas distribution margin was essentially unchanged from  although affected by a number of offsetting factors 
warmer weather than in approximately million and an adjustment nicor inc page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued related to prior year performance based rate pbr plan results million had a negative effect on margin 
these negative factors were partially offset by the impact of an increased number of customers million  higher average rates charged during the period million and higher revenue tax administration fees million 
although margin for and were essentially equal  a number of factors had offsetting impacts 
negatively impacting margin in was a smaller contribution from the chicago hub and other gas supply related activities million and lower industrial deliveries  mainly for power generation million 
the company believes commercial and industrial deliveries were unfavorably impacted by general economic conditions and higher natural gas prices 
positively impacting margin were increased customer finance and late payment charges about million related to higher natural gas prices in the absence of pbr plan losses as occurred in million and increased deliveries due to colder weather than the prior year about million  partially offset by an unfavorable variance from the company s weather hedge in compared to million  also positively impacted margin 
gas distribution operating and maintenance expense 
gas distribution operating and maintenance expense for of million was million higher than due primarily to increases in legal defense costs associated with the pbr related litigation million and payroll costs million  adjustments related to customer reimbursements million  higher bad debt expense million  due in part to high natural gas prices  and higher compliance costs million 
these negative factors were partially offset by higher pension credits million 
the increase in gas distribution operating and maintenance expense for over of million was due primarily to higher pension costs million  higher insurance expense million  increased bad debt expense million  increased natural gas costs to operate company equipment and facilities million and higher health care costs million 
these negative factors were partially offset by lower expenses related to the review of the company s pbr plan million 
operating and maintenance expenses at nicor gas are expected to continue to rise 
other gas distribution operating expenses 
property sale gains and losses vary from year to year depending upon property sales activity 
during  nicor gas realized a million gain on the sale of land 
the company continues to assess its ownership of real estate holdings and anticipates a decrease in property sale activity in mercury related costs recoveries  net reflect the estimated costs  credits and recoveries associated with the company s mercury inspection and repair program 
recoveries and costs were insignificant in however  in and  nicor gas reached agreements with insurers and independent contractors whereby the company recovered approximately million and million  respectively  of mercury related costs 
in addition  in  a million adjustment lowered the mercury related reserve and reduced operating expense 
additional information about the company s mercury inspection and repair program is presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements note contingencies mercury 
shipping operating expenses 
shipping segment operating expenses increased million in as compared to due primarily to higher voyage  inland transportation and port costs million  payroll and related costs million  leased equipment costs million and vessel charter costs million 
the increases are due primarily to higher volumes shipped 
nicor inc page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued shipping segment operating expenses rose million in versus due primarily to higher fuel costs million and increased vessel charter expenses million 
increased fuel costs reflect the impact of higher fuel prices in operating expenses of other energy ventures 
the million increase in the operating expenses compared to was due mainly to higher expenses at nicor s energy related products and services businesses million  reflecting an increased average number of utility bill management customers and the higher average cost of gas 
the million increase in the operating expenses compared to was due primarily to increased operating expenses at nicor s energy related products and services businesses million  associated largely with the addition of new customers and products 
this increase was partially offset by lower operating expenses from the company s former energy system and design activities million 
litigation charge 
the litigation charge of million relates to the settlement of the securities class action lawsuit 
other corporate expenses and eliminations 
other corporate operating expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  which are primarily legal and business development costs 
intercompany eliminations were million  million and million in  and  respectively  and related primarily to utility bill management products 
equity investment income loss  net 
equity investment results for decreased by million as compared to due primarily to the absence of a million cash recovery related to nicor energy that occurred in this equity investment was previously written off and negatively impacted results million 
information related to this investment is more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements note contingencies nicor energy 
equity investment results also include million  million and million for  and  respectively  for nicor s share of income from triton container investments llc triton  a cargo container leasing business 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million in over due to the impact of higher effective interest rates on debt million and higher estimated interest on income tax matters million  partially offset by the impact of lower average borrowing levels million 
interest expense decreased million in from due to lower average borrowing levels and interest rates 
income taxes 
the decline in the effective income tax rate to percent in from percent in was primarily a result of lower pretax income which typically causes a lower effective income tax rate since permanent differences and tax credits are a larger share of pretax income 
the company s effective income tax rate rose to percent in as compared to percent in due principally to the effects of an increase in tax expense in relating to adjustments of deferred income tax accounts 
cumulative effect of accounting change 
the cumulative effect of a january  required accounting change relates to the application of accrual accounting  rather than fair value accounting  to gas in storage and certain energy related contracts  such as storage and transportation contracts  at nicor enerchange

these resources include net cash flow from operating activities  access to capital markets  lines of credit and short term investments 
operating cash flows 
the gas distribution business is highly seasonal and operating cash flow may fluctuate significantly during the year and from year to year due to factors such as weather  natural gas prices  the timing of collections from customers  and natural gas purchasing  storage and hedging practices 
the company relies on short term financing to meet seasonal increases in working capital needs 
cash requirements generally increase over the third and fourth quarters due to increases in natural gas purchases  gas in storage and accounts receivable 
over the first and second quarters  positive cash flow generally results from the sale of gas in storage and the collection of accounts receivable 
this cash is typically used to significantly reduce short term debt during the second quarter 
nicor gas maintains margin accounts related to financial derivative transactions 
these margin accounts may cause large fluctuations in cash needs or sources in a relatively short period of time due to daily settlements resulting from changes in natural gas futures prices 
the company manages these fluctuations with short term borrowings 
net cash flow provided from used for operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the cash flows provided in and are at the levels traditionally experienced by the company 
operating cash flow for was negative due primarily to changes in working capital items in the gas distribution segment 
two decisions in were the primary factors underlying the working capital changes 
first  the company significantly increased the quantity of owned gas in storage at december  as compared to december  in addition  the company chose to fund a significant portion of those purchases through short term borrowings which are shown outside the operating section  in the financing section  of the consolidated statements of cash flows instead of through accounts payable 
as noted in the financing activities section of management s discussion and analysis  the company had increased its short term debt borrowing capacity in anticipation of these two and other factors including higher gas costs  to accommodate the funding of these decisions 
in  nicor received an income tax refund  which adjusted the deferred income tax liability  of approximately million attributable to a tax loss carryback associated with a change in tax accounting methods  subject to internal revenue service review and approval as part of normal ongoing audits 
decisions by taxing authorities may significantly impact the company s cash flow 
nicor inc page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued investing activities 
net cash flow used for investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in over was due primarily to an increase in capital expenditures and other investing activities 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures by business segment are presented below in millions estimated gas distribution shipping other energy ventures capital expenditures in the gas distribution segment were nearly unchanged for compared with increased costs in for information technology system improvements about million were largely offset by adjustments related to customer reimbursements about million  the absence of expenditures related to a service outage about million and reduced storage system expenditures about million 
capital expenditures in the gas distribution segment for versus remained relatively level 
increased costs in for gas distribution system improvements about million and higher capitalized pension costs about million were partially offset by a decrease in storage and transmission system expenditures about million compared with storage and transmission system expenditures in included the acquisition of a compressor for a storage facility 
gas distribution segment capital expenditures are expected to increase by about million in over the level due primarily to planned storage compressor and real estate expenditures 
shipping segment capital expenditures for increased million over due primarily to the purchase of freight handling equipment and facilities renovations 
shipping segment capital expenditures were lower in as compared with due primarily to the construction of two vessels completed in early shipping segment capital expenditures are expected to increase in versus due primarily to the purchase of freight handling equipment and facilities expenditures 
the estimate does not include additions to the company s fleet 
increased vessel requirements are normally met through the acquisition  charter or leasing of additional vessels 
capital expenditures are expected to be higher at our other energy ventures in versus as computer systems are upgraded and facilities expanded at the retail energy related products and services businesses

in december  s p changed its outlook from stable to negative on both nicor inc and nicor gas 
nicor s debt related financial statistics at december include long term debt  net of current maturities as a percent of capitalization times interest earned  before income taxes nicor inc page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued long term debt 
the company typically uses the net proceeds from long term debt for refinancing outstanding debt  for construction programs to the extent not provided by internally generated funds  and for general corporate purposes 
at december   nicor gas had the capacity to issue approximately million of first mortgage bonds under the terms of its indenture  of which million was available for immediate issuance under a july shelf registration filing 
nicor is in compliance with its debt covenants and believes it will continue to remain so 
nicor s long term debt agreements do not include ratings triggers or material adverse change provisions

nicor currently has no contractual or regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends 
off balance sheet arrangements 
nicor has certain guarantees  as further described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements note guarantees and indemnities 
the company believes that it is not probable that these guarantees will have a material effect on its financial condition 
nicor inc page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued contractual obligations 
as of december   nicor had contractual obligations with payments due as follows in millions payments due by period less more than than year years years years total purchase obligations  long term debt fixed interest on long term debt operating leases other long term obligations purchase obligations consist primarily of natural gas purchase agreements  and natural gas transportation and storage contracts in the gas distribution and wholesale natural gas marketing business segments 
natural gas purchase agreements include obligations to purchase natural gas at future market prices  calculated using december  new york mercantile exchange futures prices 
operating leases are primarily for vessels  containers and equipment in the shipping segment  and for office space and equipment in the gas distribution segment 
rental expense under operating leases was million  million and million in   and  respectively 
other 
restrictions imposed by regulatory agencies and loan agreements limiting the amount of subsidiary net assets that can be transferred to nicor are not expected to have a material impact on the company s ability to meet its cash obligations 
critical accounting estimates nicor prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which regularly require nicor s management to exercise judgment in the selection and application of accounting methods 
the application of accounting methods includes making estimates using subjective assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
the use of estimates and the selection of accounting policies affect nicor s reported results and financial condition 
the company has adopted several significant accounting policies and is required to make significant accounting estimates that are important to understanding its financial statements 
these significant policies and estimates are described throughout the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
although there are numerous areas in which nicor s management makes significant accounting estimates  it believes its critical estimates are those that require management s most difficult and subjective or complex judgments 
nicor s management has a practice of reviewing its critical accounting estimates and policy decisions with the audit committee of its board of directors 
its critical estimates typically involve legal contingencies  derivative instruments  pension and other postretirement benefits  income taxes  credit risk and unbilled revenues because they are estimates which could materially impact nicor s financial statements 
nicor inc page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued loss contingencies 
nicor and its subsidiaries record contingent losses as liabilities when a loss is both probable and the amount or range of loss  including related legal defense costs  is reasonably estimable 
when only a range of potential loss is estimable  the company records a liability for the minimum anticipated loss 
nicor and its subsidiaries and affiliates are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings and are exposed to various loss contingencies 
these loss contingencies are in some cases resolved in stages over time  estimates may change significantly from period to period  and the company s ultimate obligations may differ materially from its recorded amounts 
of particular note is the pbr plan contingency at nicor gas and the united states securities and exchange commission sec and us attorney inquiries described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements note contingencies 
derivative instruments 
the rules for determining whether a contract meets the definition of a derivative instrument or qualifies for hedge accounting treatment are numerous and complex 
the treatment of a single contract may vary from period to period depending upon accounting elections  changes in management s assessment of the likelihood of future hedged transactions or new interpretations of accounting rules 
as a result  management judgment is required in the determination of the appropriate accounting treatment 
in addition  the estimated fair value of derivative instruments may change significantly from period to period depending upon market projections  and changes in hedge effectiveness may impact the accounting treatment 
these determinations and changes in estimates may have a material impact on reported results 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
the company s cost of providing postretirement benefits is dependent upon various factors and assumptions  including life expectancies  the discount rate used in determining the projected benefit obligation  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the long term rate of compensation increase and anticipated health care costs 
changes in these assumptions typically do not have a significant impact on the expenses recorded from year to year 
however  actual experience in any one period  particularly the actual return on plan assets  often varies significantly from these mostly long term assumptions 
when cumulatively significant  the gains and losses generated from such variances are amortized over the remaining service lives of employees covered by the plans approximately to years 
additional information is presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements note postretirement benefits 
the company s estimated postretirement benefit cost included in operating income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
nicor gas expects to record postretirement benefit cost for of million 
actuarial assumptions affecting include an expected rate of return on plan assets of percent  consistent with the prior year  and a discount rate of percent compared with percent a year earlier 
income taxes 
a deferred income tax liability is not recorded on undistributed foreign earnings that are indefinitely reinvested offshore 
nicor has recorded a million deferred income tax liability associated with foreign earnings it may repatriate  and it has not recorded deferred income taxes of million on approximately million of cumulative undistributed foreign earnings it believes to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 
see notes to the consolidated financial statements note income taxes  for a discussion of potential impacts from the american jobs creation act of changes in management s investment or repatriation plans or circumstances could result in a different deferred income tax liability 
nicor inc page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued credit risk 
nicor s subsidiaries and affiliates are required to estimate credit risk in establishing allowances for doubtful accounts and in estimating the fair values of certain derivative instruments with counterparty credit risk being an especially difficult and critical judgment 
actual credit losses could vary materially from nicor s estimates 
nicor s allowance for doubtful accounts at december   and was million  million and million  respectively  as presented on schedule ii in item unbilled revenues 
nicor gas estimates revenues for gas deliveries not yet billed to customers from the last billing date to month end unbilled revenues 
unbilled revenue estimates are dependent upon a number of customer usage factors which require management judgment  including weather 
these estimates are adjusted when actual billings occur  and changes in estimates can be material 
estimated unbilled revenues for nicor gas at december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
other factors that may affect business performance the following factors can impact year to year comparisons and may affect the future performance of nicor s businesses 
gas distribution 
nicor gas  a regulated natural gas distribution utility  serves over million customers in a service territory that encompasses most of the northern third of illinois  excluding the city of chicago 
the region s economy is diverse and its customer base has grown steadily over the years  providing nicor gas with a well balanced mix of residential  commercial and industrial customers 
residential customers typically account for approximately to percent of natural gas deliveries  while commercial and industrial customers each typically account for about to percent 
regulation 
nicor gas is regulated by the icc  which establishes the rules and regulations governing utility rates and services in illinois 
certain rates are updated monthly and designed to recover specific past costs  such as gas supply and environmental costs  subject to an annual prudence review 
base rates  on the other hand  are designed to allow the company an opportunity to recover its costs and to earn a fair return for its investors 
significant changes in the regulations applicable to nicor gas or its affiliates  or the regulatory environment in general  could affect the performance of nicor gas 
information regarding certain icc proceedings is presented within the notes to the consolidated financial statements note contingencies performance based rate plan 
rate proceeding 
on november   nicor gas filed with the icc for an overall increase in rates of approximately million or about percent of base rates revenue 
the company s filing provided for a rate of return on original cost rate base of percent  which reflects an percent cost of common equity 
the requested rate increase is needed to recover higher operating costs and increased capital investments 
nicor gas has not raised base rates since as part of the requested rate increase  nicor gas has proposed that all chicago hub revenues  net of related administrative costs  and approximately two thirds of all bad debt expenses be passed directly through to customers  reducing the earnings variability of both items 
in addition  the company has proposed setting rates assuming normal weather of  degree days beginning in versus the  degree days currently considered by the company as normal 
the icc normally has months to complete its review of the filing and to issue an order 
the proposed rate increase has been suspended pending the completion of the icc s review 
nicor inc page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued weather 
natural gas deliveries are temperature sensitive and seasonal since about one half of all deliveries are used for space heating 
typically  about percent of deliveries and revenues occur from october through march 
fluctuations in weather have the potential to significantly impact year to year comparisons of operating income and cash flow 
it is estimated that a degree day variation from normal weather affects nicor s gas distribution earnings by about cents per share 
since the first quarter of  external weather protection has not been purchased by nicor because it also bears the partially offsetting weather risk associated with the utility bill management products marketed by nicor solutions 
the amount of this offset will vary depending upon the time of year  weather patterns  the number of customers for these products and the market price for natural gas 
in  the offsetting impact related to utility bill management products was about one third of the gas distribution weather effect 
demand and natural gas prices 
in addition to the impact of weather  significant changes in economic conditions or natural gas prices can impact customer gas usage 
nicor gas large residential customer base provides relative stability during weak economic periods  and the industrial and commercial customer base is well diversified  lessening the impact of industry specific economic swings 
however  management believes that declines since in natural gas deliveries to industrial customers may be permanent 
management also believes that deliveries for power generation  which have declined in recent years  will remain relatively flat 
changes in the price of natural gas have no direct impact on gas distribution margin since gas costs are passed directly through to customers without markup  subject to icc review 
however  high natural gas prices can have an adverse effect on accounts receivable collections  customer demand  company use gas expenses  financing costs and customer service expenses 
competition 
nicor gas is a regulated monopoly and has no competition for natural gas distribution  however  nicor gas does compete with alternative energy suppliers based on such factors as price  service and reliability 
the company believes that it is well positioned to deal with the possibility of fuel switching by customers because it has rates and services designed to compete against alternative fuels 
in addition  the company has a rate that allows negotiation with potential bypass customers  and no customer has bypassed the nicor gas system since the rate became effective in nicor gas also offers commercial and industrial customers alternatives in rates and service  increasing its ability to compete in these markets 
storage and supply 
nicor gas has a direct connection to eight interstate pipelines and extensive underground storage capacity that provides the company and its transportation customers with flexibility and alternatives for natural gas supply procurement and storage services 
in addition  in an effort to ensure supply reliability  the company purchases gas from several different producing regions under varied contract terms 
customer choice of commodity supplier 
since march  all nicor gas customers have had a choice of natural gas suppliers 
the choice of another natural gas commodity supplier has no direct impact on gas distribution margin because natural gas costs are passed directly through to customers without markup  subject to icc review 
nicor gas continues to deliver the natural gas  maintain its distribution system and respond to emergencies 
nicor inc page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued customer credit risk 
nicor gas has a diversified customer base  which limits its exposure to concentrations of credit risk in any one industry or income class 
the company believes that it maintains prudent credit policies  subject to icc regulations 
customers also have options to help them manage their bills  such as energy assistance programs for low income customers and a budget payment plan that spreads gas bills more evenly throughout the year 
however  high natural gas prices can increase the risk of customer nonpayment 
nicor gas experienced increasing bad debt expense in the past few years due in part to high natural gas prices and an increasingly adverse credit experience consistent with general economic conditions 
it is expected that high natural gas prices will continue in see also the credit risk section on page other activities 
nicor gas continues to pursue other activities  such as the chicago hub  which provides natural gas transportation and storage services 
the chicago area is a major market hub for natural gas  and demand exists for storage and transmission related services by marketers  other gas distribution companies and electric power generation facilities

shipping 
tropical shipping is one of the largest containerized cargo carriers in the bahamas and the caribbean region 
tropical shipping has a reputation for providing quality  on time delivery service a reputation that has helped the company establish a leading position in most of the markets it serves 
tropical shipping s financial results can be affected significantly by general economic conditions in the united states  the bahamas  the caribbean region and canada 
the marketplaces in the bahamas and the caribbean are very competitive  with global carriers having established a presence in several markets that tropical shipping serves 
unfavorable economic conditions in the caribbean  the bahamas and the united states in and had a negative impact on tourism and on construction projects in many of those markets 
tropical shipping s results also include amounts related to cargo insurance coverages sold to its customers and other third parties 
tropical shipping is subject to the international ship and port facility security isps code and is also subject to the united states maritime transportation security act mtsa  both of which require extensive security assessments  plans and procedures 
tropical shipping is also subject to the regulations of both the federal maritime commission fmc  and the surface transportation board stb  other federal agencies as well as local laws  where applicable 
the rules and regulations of these agencies can have an impact on the results of operations of tropical shipping 
on october   the american jobs creation act of the act was enacted 
certain provisions of the act may impact income taxes related to the earnings of foreign subsidiaries of tropical shipping 
one provision provides that a portion of a foreign subsidiary s income would no longer be subject to federal taxation as shipping income  beginning in  to the extent such earnings are retained by the foreign subsidiary 
another provision of the act allows a portion of cumulative undistributed earnings of a foreign subsidiary to be repatriated to the united states in or at an effective federal income tax rate of percent 
nicor inc page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued presently nicor has recorded a million deferred income tax liability  based on a federal income tax rate of percent  associated with approximately million of earnings of its foreign subsidiaries 
nicor has not provided deferred income taxes of approximately million on approximately million of cumulative undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries through december  that are considered to be indefinitely invested in foreign operations 
nicor is currently assessing the impact  if any  of the provisions of the act on the amount ultimately to be repatriated and is therefore unable to determine  at this time  the impact of the act on its financial statements 
the amount of cumulative undistributed tax basis earnings of its foreign subsidiaries approximately million at december  that may ultimately be repatriated in  and therefore potentially subject to the percent effective tax rate discussed above  will be impacted by several factors  including a determination of the maximum eligible repatriation amount under provisions of the act and other federal income tax rules and regulations  the ongoing cash requirements of tropical shipping  and the extent of qualifying investment uses  as defined in the act  for amounts to be repatriated 
the extent to which tropical shipping s ongoing earnings will be subject to federal taxation will be dependent upon several factors  including the amount of distributions  if any  to its us parent and the clarification of certain provisions of the act and its impact on other federal income tax rules and regulations 
accordingly  these financial statements do not reflect any impact of the act 
any future adjustments to income tax expense that may result from the act will depend on the amount  if any  of foreign earnings that are repatriated or expected to be repatriated to the united states 
such adjustments could be material to the results of operations in the period recorded 
nicor expects to complete its evaluation of the act by the end of the fourth quarter of outlook 
nicor anticipates results in the shipping segment to be higher than due to growth in volumes shipped and increased average rates 
other energy ventures 
nicor owns several energy related businesses  including two retail energy related products and services companies  and a wholesale natural gas marketing company 
nicor is also involved in several joint ventures  including a natural gas pipeline  and is pursuing various other energy related ventures 
the company has almost fully liquidated its investment in a former retail energy marketing joint venture 
nicor services and nicor solutions provide energy related products and services for retail markets  including residential and small commercial users 
the annual results from both of these businesses are driven largely by the number of customer contracts 
nicor enerchange engages in wholesale marketing of natural gas supply services primarily in the midwest 
nicor enerchange also administers the nicor gas chicago hub and manages nicor solutions product risks 
economic results from this business are driven largely by natural gas price volatility  which creates economic opportunity from which it can benefit 
nicor enerchange purchases and holds natural gas in storage to earn a profit margin from its ultimate sale 
nicor enerchange uses derivatives to mitigate commodity price risk in order to substantially lock in the profit margin that will ultimately be realized 
however  gas stored in inventory is required to be accounted for at the lower of weighted average cost or market  whereas the derivatives used to reduce the risk associated with a change in the value of the inventory are accounted for at fair value  with changes in fair value recorded in operating results in the period of change 
as a result  earnings are subject to volatility as the market price of derivatives change  even when the underlying hedged value of the inventory is unchanged 
the volatility resulting from this accounting can be significant from period to period 
nicor inc page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued outlook 
nicor anticipates results in the other energy ventures to be fairly consistent with market risks 
nicor is exposed to market risk in the normal course of its business operations  including the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas and fuel commodity prices  and interest rates 
it is nicor s practice to manage these risks utilizing derivative instruments and other methods  as deemed appropriate 
commodity price risk 
with regard to commodity price risk  the company has established policies and procedures governing the management of such risks and the use of derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to such risks 
a risk management committee oversees compliance with such policies and procedures 
the company utilizes various techniques to limit  measure and monitor market risk  including limits based on volume  dollar amounts and duration  and in some cases value at risk var 
var is the potential loss for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors  for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level 
the company s risk management committee has established exposure limits at such a level that material adverse economic results are not expected 
the company s commodity price risk policies and procedures continue to evolve with its businesses and are subject to ongoing review and modification 
in accordance with sec disclosure requirements  nicor performs sensitivity analyses to assess the potential loss in earnings based upon a hypothetical percent adverse change in market prices 
management does not believe that sensitivity analyses alone provide an accurate or reliable method for monitoring and controlling risks and therefore also relies on the experience and judgment of its management to revise strategies and adjust positions as deemed necessary 
losses in excess of the amounts determined in sensitivity analyses could occur if market prices exceed the percent shift used for the analyses 
based on nicor s unhedged positions at december   a percent decrease in natural gas prices would have increased nicor s earnings at december  by about million  which is not materially different than in the prior year 
nicor s regulated utility  nicor gas  is not directly exposed to market risk caused by changes in commodity prices because of illinois rate regulation allowing for the recovery of prudently incurred natural gas supply costs from customers 
however  substantial increases in natural gas prices may indirectly impact nicor gas earnings by increasing the cost of gas used by the company  bad debt expense  and other operating and financing expenses 
higher natural gas prices may also lead to lower customer gas consumption and margin 
the company is mitigating these risks through the use of fixed price purchase agreements  futures contracts  option contracts and swap agreements 
nicor s other energy businesses are subject to natural gas commodity price risk  arising primarily from fixed price purchase and sale agreements and natural gas inventories 
derivative instruments such as futures  options  forwards and swaps may be used to hedge these risks 
management believes it has taken appropriate steps to mitigate the other risks associated with its utility bill management arrangements  including the use of futures and swaps to partially hedge the price risk 
nicor inc page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued at december   nicor enerchange  nicor s wholesale natural gas marketing business  held derivative contracts with the following asset liability fair values  net in millions maturity total less than to to source of fair value fair value year years years prices actively quoted 


prices based on pricing models 


total 


credit risk 
the company is also exposed to credit risk in the event a counterparty  customer or supplier defaults on a contract to pay for or deliver product at agreed upon terms and conditions 
to manage this risk  the company has established procedures to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties  to require guarantees or collateral back up  and to limit its exposure to any one counterparty 
nicor also  in some instances  enters into netting arrangements to mitigate counterparty credit risk 
interest rate risk 
nicor is exposed to changes in interest rates 
the company manages its interest rate risk by issuing long term fixed rate debt with varying maturities  refinancing certain debt and periodically hedging the interest rate on anticipated short term borrowings 
if market rates were to hypothetically increase by percent from nicor s weighted average floating interest rate  interest expense would have increased causing nicor s earnings to decrease by approximately million in for further information about debt securities  interest rates and fair values  see the financial statements consolidated statements of capitalization  and the notes to the consolidated financial statements note fair value of financial instruments and note short term and long term debt 
contingencies 
the following contingencies of nicor are in various stages of investigation or disposition 
although in some cases the company is unable to estimate the amount of loss reasonably possible in addition to any amounts already recognized  it is possible that the resolution of these contingencies  either individually or in aggregate  will require the company to take charges against  or will result in reductions in  future earnings 
it is the opinion of management that the resolution of these contingencies  either individually or in aggregate  could be material to earnings in a particular period but is not expected to have a material adverse impact on nicor s liquidity or financial condition 
performance based rate plan 
nicor gas pbr plan for natural gas costs went into effect in and was terminated by the company effective january  under the pbr plan  nicor gas total gas supply costs were compared to a market sensitive benchmark 
savings and losses relative to the benchmark were determined annually and shared equally with sales customers 
the pbr is currently under illinois commerce commission icc review 
there are allegations that the company acted improperly in connection with the pbr plan  and the icc and others are reviewing these allegations 
on june  the citizens utility board cub filed a motion to reopen the record in the icc s proceedings to review the pbr plan the icc proceedings 
as a result of the motion to reopen  nicor gas  the cook county state s attorney office ccsao  the staff of the icc and cub entered into a stipulation providing for additional discovery 
the illinois attorney general s office has also intervened in this matter 
in addition  the illinois attorney general s office issued civil investigation demands cids to cub and the icc staff 
the cids ordered that cub and nicor inc page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the icc staff produce all documents relating to any claims that nicor gas may have presented  or caused to be presented  false information related to its pbr plan 
parties who were plaintiffs in a dismissed class action proceeding against the company could potentially intervene in these proceedings 
the company has committed to cooperate fully in the reviews of the pbr plan 
in response to these allegations  on july   the nicor board of directors appointed a special committee of independent  non management directors to conduct an inquiry into issues surrounding natural gas purchases  sales  transportation  storage and such other matters as may come to the attention of the special committee in the course of its investigation 
the special committee presented the report of its counsel report to nicor s board of directors on october  a copy of the report is available at the nicor website and has been previously produced to all parties in the icc proceedings 
in response  the nicor board of directors directed the company s management to  among other things  make appropriate adjustments to account for  and fully address  the adverse consequences to ratepayers of the items noted in the report  and conduct a detailed study of the adequacy of internal accounting and regulatory controls 
the adjustments were made in prior years financial statements resulting in a million liability 
included in such million liability is a million loss contingency 
a million adjustment to the previously recorded liability  which is discussed below  was made in the third quarter of increasing the recorded liability to million 
in addition  nicor gas estimates that there is million due to the company from the pbr plan year  which has not been recognized in the financial statements due to uncertainties surrounding the pbr plan 
the net of these items and interest income on certain components results in a million reimbursement the company is seeking as of december   pending resolution of the proceedings discussed below 
by the end of the company completed steps to correct the weaknesses and deficiencies identified in the detailed study of the adequacy of internal controls 
pursuant to the agreement of all parties  including the company  the icc re opened the and purchased gas adjustment filings for review of certain transactions related to the pbr plan and consolidated the reviews of the purchased gas adjustment filings with the pbr plan review 
on february   the ccsao and cub filed a motion for million in sanctions against the company in the icc proceedings 
in that motion  ccsao and cub alleged that nicor gas responses to certain cub data requests were false 
also on february   cub stated in a press release that  in addition to million in sanctions  it would seek additional refunds to consumers 
on march   the icc staff filed a response brief in support of cub s motion for sanctions 
on may   the administrative law judges issued a ruling denying cub and ccsao s motion for sanctions 
cub has filed an appeal of the motion for sanctions with the icc  and the icc has indicated that it will not rule on the appeal until the final disposition of the icc proceedings 
it is not possible to determine how the icc will resolve the claims of ccsao  cub or other parties to the icc proceedings 
in november  the icc staff  cub  ccsao and the illinois attorney general s office iago filed their respective direct testimony in the icc proceedings 
the icc staff is seeking refunds to customers of approximately million and cub and ccsao were jointly seeking refunds to customers of approximately million 
the iago direct testimony alleges adjustments in a range from million to million 
the iago testimony as filed is presently unclear as to the amount which iago seeks to have refunded to customers 
on february  the above referenced intervenors filed their rebuttal testimony in the icc proceedings 
in such rebuttal testimony  cub and ccsao amended the alleged amount to be refunded to customers from approximately million to million 
nicor gas filed rebuttal testimony in january  which is consistent with the findings of the special committee nicor inc page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued report 
nicor gas seeks a reimbursement of approximately million as referenced above 
the parties to the icc proceedings have agreed to a stay of the evidentiary hearings on this matter in order to undertake additional third party discovery from entergy koch trading  lp ekt  a natural gas  storage and transportation trader and consultant with whom nicor did business under the pbr plan 
during the course of the sec investigation discussed below  the company became aware of additional information relating to the activities of individuals affecting the pbr plan for the period from through  including information consisting of third party documents and recordings of telephone conversations from ekt 
the company continues to obtain access to and review this information 
review of additional information completed in the third quarter of resulted in the million adjustment to the previously recorded liability referenced above 
although the report of the special committee s counsel did not find that there was criminal activity or fraud  a review of this additional information which was not available to the independent counsel who prepared the report and re interviews of certain nicor gas personnel indicates that certain former nicor gas personnel may have engaged in potentially fraudulent conduct regarding the pbr plan in violation of company policy  and in possible violation of sec rules and applicable law 
further  certain former nicor gas personnel also may have attempted to conceal their conduct in connection with an icc review of the pbr plan 
the company continues to cooperate with the sec  the us attorney s office and the icc on this matter and to review and produce additional documents as requested by these agencies 
the company has reviewed all third party information it has obtained and will continue to review any additional third party information the company may obtain 
the company terminated four employees in connection with this matter in the third quarter of nicor is unable to predict the outcome of any of the foregoing reviews or the company s potential exposure thereunder 
because the pbr plan and historical gas costs are still under icc review  the final outcome could be materially different than the amounts reflected in the company s financial statements as of december  nicor energy 
significant developments occurred in and relating to nicor s percent interest in nicor energy 
information about these developments is presented within the notes to the consolidated financial statements note contingencies nicor energy 
on december   the united states attorney for the northern district of illinois indicted three former employees of nicor energy and an outside lawyer for nicor energy 
the indictments alleged that the defendants fraudulently deprived nicor energy of their honest services and caused a loss to investors in nicor inc and dynegy inc 
during the time period covered by the indictments  nicor energy was a stand alone entity with its own management and was operated independently from nicor inc and nicor gas 
none of the individuals indicted are employees of nicor inc or nicor gas nor were they at the time of the charged conduct 
the three former employees of nicor energy have pled guilty to certain charges 
separately  on december   the sec filed its own civil enforcement action against the same three former employees and one additional former employee of nicor energy 
while nicor is unable to predict the final outcome of these matters  the resolution of such matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
nicor inc page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued sec and us attorney inquiries 
in  the staff of the sec informed nicor and nicor energy that the sec is conducting a formal inquiry regarding both the pbr plan and nicor energy 
a representative of the office of the united states attorney for the northern district of illinois has notified nicor that that office is conducting an inquiry on the same matters that the sec is investigating  and a grand jury is also reviewing these matters 
in april  nicor was advised by the sec division of enforcement that it intended to recommend to the sec that it bring a civil injunctive action against nicor  alleging that nicor violated sections a of the securities act of and sections b and a of the securities exchange act of and rules b  b  a and a thereunder 
the sec may also seek injunctive relief  disgorgement and civil penalties 
the sec staff invited nicor to make a formal response known as a wells submission with respect to the proposed recommendation 
in june  nicor filed its wells submission with the sec 
in addition  in connection with the sec s invitation to the company to make a wells submission  the sec informed the company of additional sources of information relating to activities affecting the pbr plan  the status of which is addressed in detail in the performance based rate pbr plan section set forth above 
in august  nicor withdrew its wells submission in light of its continuing review of the additional sources of newly available information referenced above 
nicor continues in its efforts to resolve this matter with the sec and has requested that the sec allow nicor to file an updated wells submission if necessary
