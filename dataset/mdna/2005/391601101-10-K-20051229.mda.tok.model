general the profitability of the company and  more specifically  the profitability of its primary subsidiary  the bank  depends primarily on its net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income it earns on its loans and investment portfolio  and the interest it pays on interest bearing liabilities  which consist mainly of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
the level of our non interest income and operating expenses also affects our profitability 
non interest income consists primarily of gains on sales of loans and available for sale investments  service charge fees and commissions earned by non bank subsidiaries 
operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy related expenses  equipment and technology related expenses and other general operating expenses 
the operations of the bank  and banking institutions in general  are significantly influenced by general economic conditions and related monetary and fiscal policies of regulatory agencies 
deposit flows and the cost of deposits and borrowings are influenced by interest rates on competing investments and general market rates of interest 
lending activities are affected by the demand for financing real estate and other types of loans  which in turn are affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered and other factors affecting loan demand and the availability of funds 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
management continually evaluates its estimates and judgments including those related to the allowance for loan losses and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity 
allowance for loan losses the company maintains an allowance for loan losses based on management s evaluation of the risks inherent in its loan portfolio and the general economy 
management classifies loans as substandard  doubtful or loss as required by federal regulations 
management provides a reserve for all assets classified as loss 
further  management bases its estimates of the allowance on current economic conditions  actual loss experience and industry trends 
also  the company discontinues recognizing interest income on loans with principal and or interest past due days 
income taxes the provision or benefit for income taxes is based on taxable income  tax credits and available net operating losses 
the company records deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
if enacted tax rates change  the company would adjust the deferred tax assets and liabilities  through the provision for income taxes in the period of change  to reflect the enacted tax rate expected to be in effect when the deferred tax items reverse 
the company records a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets to reflect the expected future tax benefits expected to be realized 
in determining the appropriate valuation allowance  the company considers the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
at september   the company had deferred tax assets of million  which included a valuation allowance of million

financial condition compared to at september   the company had total assets of million  a decrease of million or from the million recorded at the close of the comparable period one year ago 
investments and mortgage backed securities at september   amounted to million a decrease of million or from the million held at september   as a result of prepayments of million offset in part by purchases of million 
loans receivable and loans held for sale at september   amounted to million  a decrease of from the million held at september   primarily as a result of a million decrease in the bank s single family loan portfolio  coupled with a million decline in commercial and consumer loans outstanding 
those declines were due primarily to payoffs and lower than anticipated loan originations 
deposits amounted to million at september   a decrease of million from the million held one year ago  and was primarily the result of the sale of three branches located in washington  dc  winchester and sterling  virginia 
those sales accounted for approximately million of the decline in deposits and was coupled with the million decline in certificates of deposits of  or more  continuing the bank s approach to rely less and less on those types of deposit 
results of operations compared to net income 
for the fiscal year ended september   the company had a net loss of million or per diluted share compared to a loss of million or per diluted share for fiscal year the million improvement in earnings over the comparable period one year ago resulted from a decrease of million in non interest expense and was coupled with a decrease of  in provision for income taxes 
those improvements in expenses were offset in part by a decrease of million in non interest income  a decrease in net interest income of  and an increase in provision for loan losses 
the  increase in the provision for loan losses was due primarily to an increase in the required allowance for non performing loans  notwithstanding a reduction in the required allowance loan losses based on the structure of the bank s overall loan portfolio 
net interest income 
an important source of our earnings is net interest income  which is the difference between income earned on interest earning assets  such as loans  investment securities and mortgage backed securities  and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings 
the level of net interest income is determined primarily by the relative average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in combination with the yields earned and rates paid upon them 
the correlation between the repricing of interest rates on assets and on liabilities also influences net interest income 
the following table presents a comparison of the components of interest income and expense and net interest income 
years ended september  difference amount dollars in thousands interest income loans   investments   total    interest expense deposits   borrowings    total    net interest income   our decline in net interest income for fiscal year resulted primarily from a million decrease in the bank s average interest earning assets offset in part by a decrease of million in the bank s average interest bearing liabilities coupled with a basis point increase in net interest margin net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
the bank s net interest margin increased from for fiscal year ended september  to for fiscal year ended september  contributing to the improvement in the bank s net interest margin was a million decline in interest expense resulting from payments made on certain interest rate swap and cap agreements in fiscal year compared to a charge of million in fiscal the improvement in net interest margin also resulted from increasing the average yield on interest earning assets by basis points more than the increase in the average cost on average interest bearing liabilities  but was partially offset by a decrease in the amount that the bank s average interest earning assets exceeded the decrease in average interest bearing liabilities by million 
interest income 
interest income for the fiscal year ended september  decreased million compared to fiscal year  primarily as a result of a decrease in the average outstanding balances of loans and investment securities 
that decrease was partially offset by a basis point increase of in the average yield earned on interest earning assets 
interest expense 
the million decrease in interest expense for fiscal year compared to the period was principally the result of a million decrease in average deposits and borrowed funds 
the decrease was partially offset by a basis point increase in the cost of funds on average deposits and borrowed funds 
the increase in interest expense on deposits was primarily due to a basis point increase in rates paid on certificates of deposit  savings and now and money market accounts 
that increase was partially offset by a decrease of million  in certificates  savings and now and money market accounts from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase in rates was primarily due to market rates moving rates higher on interest bearing demand deposits  savings accounts and certificates and the pricing on new and renewed time deposits

the following table presents certain information regarding changes in interest income and interest expense attributable to changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated 
the change in interest attributable to both rate and volume has been allocated to the changes in rate and volume on a pro rata basis 
year ended september  year ended september  compared to year compared to year ended september  ended september  change attributable to change attributable to volume rate total volume rate total in thousands real estate loans     consumer loans   commercial business loans total loans   investments    mortgage backed securities   total interest earning assets      savings accounts now and money market accounts certificates of deposit total deposits  fhlb advances  other borrowings   total interest bearing liabilities     change in net interest income    provision for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses  which is established through provisions for losses charged to expense  is increased by recoveries on loans previously charged off and is reduced by charge offs on loans 
determining the proper reserve level or allowance involves management s judgment based upon a review of factors  including the company s internal review process  which segments the loan portfolio into groups based on loan type 
management then looks at its classified assets  which are loans days or more delinquent  and classifies those loans as special mention  substandard or doubtful  based on the performance of the loans 
those classified loans are then individually evaluated for impairment 
since the historical three year loss experience for the bank is new  those loans that are not classified are not individually evaluated 
those loans that are not individually evaluated are then segmented by type and assigned a reserve percentage that reflects the industry loss experience 
the loans individually evaluated for impairment are measured by either the present value of expected future cash flows  the loans observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral 
although management utilizes its best judgment in providing for probable losses  there can be no assurance that the bank will not have to increase its provisions for loan losses in the future 
an increase in provision may result from an adverse market for real estate and economic conditions generally in the company s primary market area  future increases in non performing assets or for other reasons which would adversely affect the company s results of operations 
non performing assets were million or of total assets at september   compared to non performing assets of  or of total assets at september  at september   assets of million were classified as substandard   classified as doubtful and  classified as real estate owned 
the increase in non performing assets from the comparable period one year ago was due primarily to a million home loan that became non performing 
as a result  the bank provided an increase of  in the required allowance for the bank s non performing loans 
notwithstanding a reduction in the required allowance  based on the structure of the bank s overall loan portfolio  the provision for loan losses was increased due primarily to an increase in the required allowance for non performing loans 
non interest income 
non interest income decreased million during fiscal  over fiscal that decrease was primarily the result of a decrease of million in gain on sale of loans 
the decrease was partially offset by increases of million in gains on derivatives   in other operating income   in gains on sale of investments and  in service fee income 
the level of gain on sale of loans during fiscal resulted from lower than anticipated loan origination and sales volumes at the bank s mortgage banking subsidiary and lower margins on those sales than those obtained in the year ago period 
the increase in other operating income reflects the gain of  recognized from the sale of the bank s washington dc  winchester and sterling  virginia  branches 
during fiscal year  disbursements on loans originated for sale amounted to million compared to million during fiscal year the million decrease in loans originated and disbursed was largely attributable to a decline in originations by the bank s subsidiary mortgage corporation as originations under its fha streamline refinancing program declined 
during the year  substantially all loans originated were sold in the secondary market  in most cases with servicing released 
proceeds from the sale of loans for fiscal amounted to million compared to million during fiscal year sales of loans resulted in gains of million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the following table presents a comparison of the components of non interest income

noninterest expense for fiscal amounted to million  a decrease of million or from the million incurred in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in the mortgage company s non interest expense from the comparable period one year ago as a result of decreased loan origination and sales and a new compensation agreement entered into with the manager of the mortgage company 
the decrease in non interest expense at the mortgage company level was primarily million in compensation of which was an expense reimbursement by the manager  under the manager s agreement  coupled with decreases in other operating expenses  data processing and occupancy 
the expense reimbursement by the manager was reduced by  to million  because his escrow account was depleted and he had not posted sufficient collateral to securitize the account receivable due from him 
working under extensions to the existing agreement the mortgage company attempted to obtain an amendment to the agreement and to obtain additional collateral from the manager 
based on the progress of those negotiations  and the need for the bank to obtain regulatory approval for any amendment  the company has concluded that an agreement cannot be reached in a timely fashion and  therefore  that collection of the receivable is not assured 
accordingly  at september   the company set up a reserve for loss and charged  against earnings to account for the funds that would otherwise have been contributed to the mortgage company by the manager 
those decreases were offset by increases in advertising  furniture fixtures and equipment and professional services 
the decrease in the bank s non interest expense amounted to  distributed over various non interest expense categories and was primarily due to a decline of  in occupancy expense

the company files a consolidated federal income tax return with its subsidiaries and computes its income tax provision or benefit on a consolidated basis 
the company believes that it will generate future taxable income to assure utilization of the existing net operating losses 
management has provided a valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets of million  due to the timing of the generation of future taxable income 
at september   the company had net operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately million  which expire in years to as a result of the change in ownership of the bank  approximately million of the total net operating loss carryforwards is subject to an annual usage limitation of approximately  contractual commitments and obligations the following summarizes the company s contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments  including maturing certificates of deposit  as of september  and the effect such obligations may have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods

asset liability management the primary objective of asset liability management is to ensure the steady growth of the company s primary earnings component  net interest income  and the maintenance of reasonable levels of capital independent of fluctuating interest rates 
interest rate risk can be defined as the vulnerability of an institution s financial condition and or results of operations to movements in interest rates 
interest rate risk  or sensitivity  arises when the maturity or repricing characteristics of assets differ significantly from the maturity or repricing characteristics of liabilities 
management endeavors to structure the balance sheet so that repricing opportunities exist for both assets and liabilities in roughly equivalent amounts at approximately the same time intervals to maintain interest rate risk at an acceptable level 
management oversees the asset liability management function and meets periodically to monitor and manage the structure of the balance sheet  control interest rate exposure  and evaluate pricing strategies for the company 
the asset mix of the balance sheet is continually evaluated in terms of several variables yield  credit quality  and appropriate funding sources and liquidity 
management of the liability mix of the balance sheet focuses on expanding the company s various funding sources 
at times  depending on the general level of interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  the bank may determine to increase our interest rate risk position in order to increase our net interest margin 
the bank manages its exposure to interest rates by structuring the balance sheet in the ordinary course of business 
the bank currently emphasizes adjustable rate loans and or loans that mature in a relatively short period when compared to single family residential loans 
in addition  to the extent possible  the bank attempts to attract longer term deposits 
while the bank has entered into interest rate swaps and caps to assist in managing interest rate risk  it has not entered into instruments such as leveraged derivatives  structured notes  financial options  financial futures contracts or forward delivery contracts to manage interest rate risk 
one of the ways the bank monitors interest rate risk is through an analysis of the relationship between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to measure the impact that future changes in interest rates will have on net interest income 
an interest rate sensitive asset or liability is one that  within a defined time period  either matures or experiences an interest rate change in line with general market interest rates 
the management of interest rate risk is performed by analyzing the maturity and repricing relationships between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at specific points in time gap and by analyzing the effects of interest rate changes on net interest income over specific periods of time by projecting the performance of the mix of assets and liabilities in varied interest rate environments 
the table below to be updated illustrates the maturities or repricing of the company s assets and liabilities  including noninterest bearing sources of funds to specific periods  at september  estimates and assumptions concerning allocating prepayment rates of major asset categories are based on information obtained from farin and associates on projected prepayment levels on mortgage backed and related securities and decay rates on savings  now and money market accounts 
the bank believes that such information is consistent with our current experience 
three days days one year years to five days to to dne to three five years or maturing or repricing periods or less days year years years more total dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans adjustable and balloon       fixed rate       commercial business        consumer   investment securities     mortgage backed securities      total        interest bearing liabilities deposits savings accounts      now accounts      money market accounts        certificates of deposit      borrowings fhlb advances     other borrowings    derivatives matched against liabilities     total        gap        cumulative gap       ratio of cumulative gap to total interest earning assets as indicated in the interest rate sensitivity table  the twelve month cumulative gap  representing the total net assets and liabilities that are projected to re price over the next twelve months  was asset sensitive in the amount of million at september  while the gap position is a useful tool in measuring interest rate risk and contributes toward effective asset and liability management  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates solely on the gap measure without accounting for alterations in the maturity or repricing characteristics of the balance sheet that occur during changes in market interest rates 
the gap position reflects only the prepayment assumptions pertaining to the current rate environment  and assets tend to prepay more rapidly during periods of declining interest rates than they do during periods of rising interest rates 
management uses two other analyses to manage interest rate risk an earnings at risk analysis to develop an estimate of the direction and magnitude of the change in net interest income if rates move up or down basis points  and a value at risk analysis to estimate the direction and magnitude of the change in net portfolio value if rates move up or down to basis points 
currently the bank uses a sensitivity of net interest income analysis prepared by farin and associates to measure earnings at risk and the ots interest rate risk exposure report to measure value at risk 
the following table sets forth the earnings at risk analysis that measures the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates at september  net interest income sensitivity analysis changes in rate basis point percent by basis net interest change change from point margin from base base in a rising rate scenario the bank is not within the limits established by the board of directors 
management will monitor the situation over the next several quarters to determine if a change should be made in our position 
the above table indicates that  based on an immediate and sustained basis point increase in market interest rates  net interest margin  as measured as a percent of total assets  would decrease by basis points or and  if interest rates decrease basis points  net interest margin  as a percent of total assets  would increase by basis points or 
the net interest income sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
the estimates used are based upon assumptions as to the nature and timing of interest rate levels including the shape of the yield curve 
those estimates have been developed based upon current economic conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
presented below  as of september   is an analysis of our interest rate risk as measured by changes in net portfolio value for parallel shifts of up and down basis points in market interest rates net portfolio value as a percent of net portfolio value the present value of assets changes in rates dollar percent net portfolio change in bp change change value ratio npv ratio dollars in thousands the improvement in net portfolio value of  or in the event of a basis point increase in rates is a result of the current amount of adjustable rate loans and investments held by the bank as of september  the foregoing increase in net portfolio value  in the event of an increase in interest rates of basis points  currently exceeds the company s internal board guidelines 
in addition to the strategies set forth above  in  the bank began using derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  to help manage interest rate risk 
the bank does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
all derivative financial instruments are used in accordance with board approved risk management policies 
the bank enters into interest rate swap agreements principally to manage its exposure to the impact of rising short term interest rates on its earnings and cash flows 
since short term interest rates have increased since the inception of the interest rate swap agreements  the change in fair value of the interest rate swap agreements has resulted in gains of approximately  for fiscal the bank does not foresee any significant changes in the strategies used to manage interest rate risk in the near future 
compared to net income 
for the fiscal year ended september   the company sustained net losses of million or per diluted share  compared to net earnings of million or per diluted share for fiscal year the million decrease in net earnings was primarily due to decreases in non interest income and net interest income  which were only partially offset by a decrease in non interest expense 
a decline in the fha streamline refinancing market  which appears to have peaked in fiscal  led to a decline in loan originations and sales at the bank s mortgage banking subsidiary and contributed to the decline in net earnings 
net interest income 
an important source of our earnings is net interest income  which is the difference between income earned on interest earning assets  such as loans  investment securities and mortgage backed securities  and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings 
the level of net interest income is determined primarily by the relative average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in combination with the yields earned and rates paid upon them

interest income for the fiscal year ended september  decreased million compared to fiscal year  primarily as a result of a basis point decrease in the average yield earned on interest earning assets 
that decrease was partially offset by an increase of million in the average outstanding balances of loans and investment securities 
interest expense 
the  decrease in interest expense for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was principally the result of a basis point decrease in the cost of funds on average deposits and borrowed funds 
that decrease was offset by a million increase in average deposits and borrowed funds 
the decrease in interest expense on deposits was primarily due to a basis point decrease in rates paid on average certificates of deposit  savings and now and money market accounts and was coupled with a million or decrease in certificates  savings and now and money market accounts  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase in borrowing expense was primarily attributable to average borrowings increasing by million

non performing assets decreased  from the comparable period one year ago  the provision for loan losses decreased  the decrease in non performing assets from the year ago period was due to the non performing status of one of the bank s commercial business loans 
the decrease in provision was due primarily to a reduction in the required provision for that loan since the bank is in the process of liquidating that loan from the cash flow of the collateral securing the loan 
noninterest income

the company files a consolidated federal income tax return with its subsidiaries and computes its income tax provision or benefit on a consolidated basis 
the company believes that it will generate future taxable income to assure utilization of the existing net operating losses 
management has provided a valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets of million  due to the timing of the generation of future taxable income 
at september   the company had net operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately million  which expire in years to as a result of the change in ownership of the bank  approximately million of the total net operating loss carryforwards is subject to an annual usage limitation of approximately  liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
the bank s primary sources of funds are deposits  principal and interest payments on loans  mortgage backed and investment securities and borrowings 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank has continued to maintain the levels of liquid assets as previously required by ots regulations 
the bank manages its liquidity position and demands for funding primarily by investing excess funds in short term investments and utilizing fhlb advance and reverse repurchase agreements in periods when the bank s demands for liquidity exceed funding from deposit inflows 
the bank s most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents  interest bearing deposits and securities available for sale 
the levels of those assets are dependent on the bank s operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at september   cash and cash equivalents  interest bearing deposits and securities available for sale totaled  million  or of total assets 
the primary investing activities of the bank are the origination of residential one to four family loans  commercial real estate loans  real estate construction and development loans  commercial business and consumer loans and the purchase of united states treasury and agency securities  mortgage backed and mortgage related securities and other investment securities 
during the year ended september   the bank s loan originations and purchases totaled million 
purchases of united states treasury and agency securities  mortgage backed and mortgage related securities and other investment securities totaled million for the year ended september  during the period the bank also exchanged loans for million of mortgage backed securities  which were sold for million 
the bank has other sources of liquidity if a need for additional funds arises 
at september   the bank had million in advances outstanding from the fhlb and had an additional overall borrowing capacity from the fhlb of million at that date 
depending on market conditions  the pricing of deposit products and fhlb advances  the bank may continue to rely on fhlb borrowings to fund asset growth 
at september   the bank had commitments to fund loans and unused outstanding lines of credit  unused standby letters of credit and undisbursed proceeds of construction mortgages totaling million 
the bank anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan origination commitments 
certificate accounts  including ira and keogh accounts  which are scheduled to mature in less than one year from september   totaled million 
based upon experience  management believes the majority of maturing certificates of deposit will remain with the bank 
in addition  management of the bank believes that it can adjust the rates offered on certificates of deposit to retain deposits in changing interest rate environments 
in the event that a significant portion of these deposits are not retained by the bank  the bank would be able to utilize fhlb advances and reverse repurchase agreements to fund deposit withdrawals  which would result in an increase in interest expense to the extent that the average rate paid on such borrowings exceeds the average rate paid on deposits of similar duration 
capital resources 
at september   the bank exceeded all minimum regulatory capital requirements with a tangible capital level of million  or of total adjusted assets  which exceeds the required level of million  or  core capital of million  or of total adjusted assets  which exceeds the required level of million  or  and risk based capital of million  or of risk weighted assets  which exceeds the required level of million  or

the sale of the preferred securities yielded million after deducting offering expenses 
the company retained approximately million of the proceeds for general corporate purposes  investing the retained funds in short term investments 
the remaining million of the proceeds was invested in the bank to increase its capital position 
changes in levels of interest rates may adversely affect us 
in general  market risk is the sensitivity of income to variations in interest rates and other relevant market rates or prices 
the company s market rate sensitive instruments include interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the company enters into market rate sensitive instruments in connection with its various business operations  particularly its mortgage banking activities 
loans originated  and the related commitments to originate loans that will be sold  represent market risk that is realized in a short period of time  generally two or three months 
the company s primary source of market risk exposure arises from changes in united states interest rates and the effects thereof on mortgage prepayment and closing behavior  as well as depositors choices interest rate risk 
changes in these interest rates will result in changes in the company s earnings and the market value of its assets and liabilities 
we expect to continue to realize income from the differential or spread between the interest earned on loans  securities and other interest earning assets  and the interest paid on deposits  borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities 
that spread is affected by the difference between the maturities and re pricing characteristics of interest earnings assets and interest bearing liabilities 
loan volume and yields are affected by market interest rates on loans  and rising interest rates generally are associated with fewer loan originations 
management expects that a substantial portion of our assets will continue to be indexed to changes in market interest rates and we intend to attract a greater proportion of short term liabilities  which will help address our interest rate risk 
the lag in implementation of re pricing terms on our adjustable rate assets may result in a decline in net interest income in a rising interest rate environment 
there can be no assurance that our interest rate risk will be minimized or eliminated 
further  an increase in the general level of interest rates may adversely affect the ability of certain borrowers to pay the interest on and principal of their obligations 
accordingly  changes in levels of market interest rates  primarily increases in market interest rates  could materially adversely affect our interest rate spread  asset quality  loan origination volume and overall financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities 
the company has little or no risk related to trading accounts  commodities or foreign exchange 
to mitigate the impact of changes in market interest rates on our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  we actively manage the amounts and maturities of these assets and liabilities 
a key component of this strategy is the origination and retention of short term and adjustable rate assets and the origination and sale of fixed rate loans 
we retain short term and adjustable rate assets because they have re pricing characteristics that more closely match the re pricing characteristics of our liabilities 
to further mitigate the risk of timing differences in the re pricing of assets and liabilities  our interest earning assets are matched with interest bearing liabilities that have similar re pricing characteristics 
for example  the interest rate risk of holding fixed rate loans is managed with long term deposits and borrowings  and the risk of holding arms is managed with short term deposits and borrowings 
periodically  mismatches are identified and managed by adjusting the re pricing characteristics of our interest bearing liabilities with derivatives  such as interest rate caps and interest rate swaps
