item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document 
overview imation is a global technology development  manufacturing  sourcing and distribution company that derives revenue and profits primarily from the sale of removable data storage media products to both consumers and businesses 
these products range from floppy diskettes  recordable cds and dvds  solid state removable flash memory  and tape cartridges used in small and medium businesses to high capacity tape cartridges used in large automated tape silos in a data center environment 
these products are sold in the us and in over other countries  and approximately percent of the company s revenues for came from outside the us the company also has a specialty papers business  representing approximately four percent of revenues for  which manufactures and distributes carbonless paper for use in the creation of multi part business forms 
the data storage market presents attractive growth opportunities as well as challenges 
the market is highly competitive  characterized by continuing changes in technology  ongoing and variable price erosion  diverse distribution channels  and a large variety of formats for both tape and optical products 
during the second quarter of  price competition for recordable optical products was unusually strong 
this resulted from increased supply as significant additional manufacturing capacity in asia came on line  coupled with softer than expected demand for the company s products principally in the us and europe 
price reductions in optical products moderated somewhat during the second half of  but the company experienced softer than expected demand for certain of its magnetic tape products 
in the fourth quarter of  demand for magnetic tape products returned to more normal levels 
the company delivers a broad portfolio of products across diverse distribution channels and geographies 
success in this market is dependent on being early to market with new formats  having efficient sourcing  manufacturing and supply chain operations  maintaining competitive total delivered cost  working closely with leading oem s original equipment manufacturers to develop enhancements to existing and new formats  carrying a broad assortment of products across multiple competing drive platforms  and having a broad geographic and market coverage across a variety of distribution channels 
while the demand for data storage media continues to grow at a modest rate  the highest revenue growth opportunities include newer tape formats in semi proprietary or open system environments  recordable optical discs  which currently are more consumer oriented products  and removable flash memory 
these higher revenue growth opportunities provide revenue streams that are  as a rule  at lower gross profit margins than the company s historical gross margins on the magnetic media businesses 

table of contents the company s strategy is to take advantage of these growth opportunities by establishing strategic sourcing  brand distribution  and licensing arrangements and by implementing a relatively flat and efficient operating structure 
for example  while the company has intellectual property  patents and know how in optical media  it sources products from third party manufacturers 
as a result  the company s business is a combination of a manufacturer and a brand distributor 
this strategy can support higher revenue without the need to add substantial infrastructure or overhead costs  thus delivering increased gross margin dollars and operating profit growth on increased revenues 
further  the company launched various restructuring activities in to simplify structure  improve decision making speed and lower overall operating costs 
in addition  the company has also launched a program implementing lean enterprise principles throughout the company  starting in manufacturing and critical business processes 
the emphasis of lean enterprise principles is speed  quality and competitive cost across all key functions and processes

except for the sale leaseback payments recorded in long term liabilities  timing of payments for the vast majority of the remaining long term liabilities  primarily consisting of pension and other post retirement benefit liabilities  cannot be reasonably determined 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates to ensure they are consistent with historical experience and the various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and could materially impact the company s results of operations 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements income tax accruals and valuation allowances when preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate the income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax obligations based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
in the event there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in the results of operations  the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded in the period the unusual or one time item occurred 
tax law requires certain items to be included in the company s tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the results of operations 
as a result  the annual effective tax rate reflected in the results of operations is different than that reported on the tax return ie  the cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in the company s tax return  and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense on capital assets 
these timing differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a 
table of contents tax deduction or credit in the company s tax return in future years for which the expense has already been recorded in the statements of operations 
the company must assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established against those deferred tax assets 
due to uncertainties related to the company s ability to utilize some portion of its deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance of million has been recorded as of december   resulting in a net deferred tax asset of million 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which a deduction has already been taken in the tax return  but the items have not been recognized as expense in the results of operations 
significant judgment is required in evaluating tax positions  and in determining the provision for income taxes  as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax assets 
the company establishes reserves when  despite its belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable  certain positions are likely to be challenged and the company may ultimately not prevail in defending those positions 
the reserves are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit 
the effective tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as related interest 
these reserves relate to various tax years subject to audit by taxing authorities 
the company believes that the current tax reserves are adequate  and reflect the most probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
however  the ultimate outcome may differ from current estimates and assumptions and could impact the provision for income taxes reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would likely require the use of cash 
favorable resolution could result in reduced income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations in the future 
litigation management s current estimated range of liability related to pending litigation is based on claims for which the company can estimate the amount or range of loss 
based upon information presently available  management believes that accruals for these claims are adequate 
due to uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation  the company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
while these matters could materially affect operating results in future periods depending on the final resolution  it is management s opinion that after final disposition  any monetary liability to the company beyond that provided in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  would not be material to the company s financial position 
as additional information becomes available  potential liability related to pending litigation will be assessed and estimates will be revised as necessary 
the company s most significant litigation matter relates to jazz photo  which is described in item to this form k and note to the consolidated financial statements 
excess inventory and obsolescence accruals the company writes down its inventory for estimated excess and obsolescence to the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  adjustments to these reserves may be required 
as of december   the excess inventory and obsolescence accruals were million 
rebates the company maintains an accrual for customer rebates which totaled million as of december  this accrual requires a program by program estimation of outcomes based on a variety of factors including customer unit sell through volumes and end user redemption rates 
in the event that actual volumes and redemption rates differ from the estimates used in the accrual calculation  adjustments to the accrual  upward or downward  may be necessary 
other accrued liabilities the company also maintains other accrued liabilities  including uninsured claims and pensions 
these accruals are based on a variety of factors including past experience and various actuarial assumptions and  in many cases  require estimates of events not yet reported to the company 
if future experience differs from these estimates  operating results in future periods would be impacted 
the company s pension obligations and net periodic pension cost are dependent on various actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions relate to discount rates  salary growth  long term return on plan assets  and other factors 
these rates vary by plan and are set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the discount rate assumptions are based on current investment yields on high quality fixed income investments 
the company s salary growth assumptions reflect long term actual experience as well as the future and 
table of contents near term outlook 
long term return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results and management s expectation of the future economic environment  as well as target asset allocations 
actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants 
recently issued accounting standards in december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be valued at fair value on the date of grant  and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period 
pro forma disclosure of the income statement effects of share based payments will no longer be an alternative 
sfas no 
r is effective for all stock based awards granted on or after july   which is the beginning of the company s third quarter 
in addition  companies must also recognize compensation expense related to any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date 
compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas r allows for either prospective recognition of compensation expense or retrospective recognition  which may be back to the original issuance of sfas no 
or only to interim periods in the year of adoption 
the company is currently evaluating these transition methods 
in march  the fasb issued emerging issues task force eitf no

eitf no 
also includes new disclosure requirements for cost method investments and for all investments that are in an unrealized loss position 
in september  the fasb delayed the accounting provisions of eitf no 
 however the disclosure requirements remain effective and the applicable ones have been adopted for the company s year end the company will evaluate the effect  if any  of eitf when final guidance is issued 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of this fsp allows additional time for companies to determine how the new law affects a company s accounting for deferred tax liabilities on unremitted foreign earnings
