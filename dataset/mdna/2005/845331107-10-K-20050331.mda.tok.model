item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations safe harbor statement the information in this discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
see forward looking statements above for additional information 
the following discusses the financial condition and results of operations of southwest water company and subsidiaries and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview southwest water company and subsidiaries southwest water  we  us  our or the company  unless the context otherwise requires  provide a broad range of services including water production  treatment and distribution  wastewater collection and treatment  utility billing and collection  utility infrastructure construction management  and public works services 
we own regulated public utilities and also serve cities  utility districts and private companies under contract 
we provide our services to more than two million people 
our subsidiaries are segmented into two operating groups our utility group and our services group 
our utility group owns and operates public water and wastewater utilities in california  new mexico  oklahoma and texas 
state and federal agencies issue regulations regarding standards of water quality  safety  environmental and other matters which affect these operations 
the rates that our regulated utility subsidiaries charge for water and wastewater usage are established by state authorities 
our services group operates our contract service businesses in which we operate and maintain water and wastewater facilities owned by cities  public agencies  municipal utility districts  private entities and investor owned utilities including utility group affiliates primarily in alabama  california  colorado  georgia  mississippi  new jersey  new mexico  south dakota and texas 
while state and federal agencies issue regulations regarding standards of water quality  safety  environmental and other matters which affect these operations  our services group prices are not subject to regulation 
we also provide multiple family utility billing and collection services in numerous states 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated years ended december  of revenue of revenue of revenue amounts in millions revenues utility group services group expenses operating expenses utility group operating expenses services group selling  general and administrative expenses operating income other income expense interest expense interest income gain on sales of land other income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income compared to revenues utility group utility group revenues represent fees earned for the production and distribution of water and the collection and treatment of sewage for residential  business  industrial and public authority use 
revenues in the utility group increased approximately million  or  to million during from million during the prior year 
the increase in utility group revenues was primarily due to the following an increase of approximately million attributable to monarch utilities 
monarch utilities was acquired in july  an increase of approximately million representing increases in rates at our california utility  and an increase of approximately million representing the favorable effect of increased connections at our new mexico and texas utilities  excluding monarch 
services group services group revenues represent fees earned for water and wastewater facility operations and maintenance services  equipment maintenance and repair  sewer pipeline cleaning  billing and collection services  public works and state certified water and wastewater laboratory analysis 
our services group also facilitates the design  construction  project management  and operating aspects of various water and wastewater projects 
revenues in increased approximately million  or  to million from million during the prior year 
the increase in services group revenues was primarily due to the following an increase of approximately million resulting from operations and maintenance contracts which were new in or initiated in the latter part of  which included contracts serving the cities of pascagoula  mississippi  santa paula and san simeon  california  as well as monarch utilities 
we achieved further revenue growth by increasing billing rates and expanding services under certain existing contracts 
an increase of approximately million earned by our subsidiaries that provide state certified water and wastewater laboratory services and government services 
certain of these subsidiaries were acquired in the latter portion of or during an increase of approximately million from multiple family utility billing and collection services  due primarily to the purchase of approximately  billing units during the first half of  and an increase in utility metering equipment installations 
these factors were partially offset by decreased activity as construction of the cvwd reverse osmosis water treatment facility neared completion 
project revenue decreased by million from million in to million during this facility was substantially complete as of december  and became operational in december our services group was affected by unusually heavy precipitation in  primarily in texas 
heavy rainfall or storm conditions may limit our ability to perform certain billable work such as pipeline maintenance  manhole rehabilitation  construction and other outdoor services 
severe weather conditions may also result in additional labor and material costs to us as we meet the terms of our operations and maintenance contracts 
we believe that higher than average precipitation limited or delayed our ability to perform billable services and construction during for example  precipitation in the services group s houston base of operations for the years ended december  and was as follows for the years ended december  of average of average precipitation inches source houston chronicle expenses operating expenses utility group operating expenses utility group represent the costs of purchasing  producing and distributing water  collecting and treating wastewater  salaries  wages and employee benefits  facilities costs  supplies and equipment  repairs and maintenance  professional fees and other costs 
operating expenses utility group represented approximately and of revenues from utility operations for and  respectively 
operating expenses utility group increased approximately million  or  to million during from million during the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the following operating costs of approximately million attributable to monarch utilities since its acquisition in july  an increase in volume and in the number of connections served by our new mexico and texas utilities  an increase of approximately million for utility plant maintenance and repair costs  increased energy costs  and an approximate million accrual for doubtful accounts related to a california industrial customer 
the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues was due to increased utility group revenues  which were primarily attributable to an increase in rates at our california utility 
also  the water we sell to our customers is either pumped from our own wells or purchased from outside sources 
costs to produce water from our wells are generally less than our cost to purchase water from outside sources 
a higher portion of the water we sold to our customers was produced from our own wells in the percentage of water used in our operations that was produced from our own wells was and during and  respectively  at our california utility 
this increase in water production related to two new wells that were placed in service in april and october of the aggregate average cost of purchased and produced water in california was and per acre foot in and  respectively 
the impact of the monarch utilities acquisition partially offset the lower california water costs 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenues are higher for monarch utilities than for our california  new mexico and other texas utilities 
operating expenses services group operating expenses services group represent salaries  wages and employee benefits  facilities costs  supplies and equipment  repairs and maintenance  professional fees and other costs 
operating expenses services group represented approximately and of revenues from services group operations for and  respectively 
operating expenses services group increased approximately million  or  to million during from million during the increase was due primarily to the following approximately million of the increase was due to costs to provide services under certain significant contracts with the cities of pascagoula  santa paula and san simeon 
these contracts were new in or initiated in the latter portion of approximately million in operating expenses for multiple family utility billing and collection contracts due to costs associated with increased installations of utility metering equipment and higher costs of servicing the  customer units which were acquired during the first half of approximately million in operating expenses incurred by subsidiaries that were established or acquired in the latter portion of or during these subsidiaries provide state certified water and wastewater laboratory services and government services 
during we incurred costs specific to certain operational or administrative issues 
these costs included i an inventory valuation adjustment of million on our inventory of proprietary equipment at the multiple family billing and collection subsidiary  ii an accrued loss of million related to the virginia beach wastewater collection system rehabilitation project  and iii a million write off of certain uncollectible construction receivables 
operating expenses services group increased from to of services group revenues 
this increase is partially attributable to increased salaries and wages  increased employee health insurance costs  increased general insurance and workers compensation insurance costs  increased cost of gasoline used by our fleet of vehicles  and reduced service group staff utilization levels during relative to many of our services group contracts contain annual contractual price increases tied to national consumer price indices 
we believe that these consumer price indices may not fully reflect the inflation in key costs in our services group 
the increases noted above were partially offset by lower construction costs for the reverse osmosis water treatment facility in california as it neared completion 
costs for the project were approximately million  a reduction of million from the incurred during selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist mainly of costs related to personnel  facilities  insurance  consulting and professional services  which support our sales  marketing  human resources  finance and administration functions 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues to in from in selling  general and administrative costs increased approximately million  or  to million for from million during the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to approximately million due to our efforts to prepare for and comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations  which included costs associated with i the enhancement and documentation of internal controls  ii improvements and enhancements in our information technology area  iii internal control compliance testing  iv the enhancement and implementation of corporate governance policies  and v additional consultant fees  audit fees  and director meetings  approximately million due to increases in professional fees  facilities costs  and labor and benefits costs for administrative employees  approximately million attributable to monarch utilities since its acquisition in july  approximately million due to an accrual for doubtful receivables related to a strategic development partnership  approximately million due to executive separation and retention charges  and approximately million for increased new business development costs associated with the research of potential new projects 
other income expense interest expense interest expense increased approximately million  or  during compared to the major components of interest expense are as follows for the years ended december  in millions interest expense convertible subordinate debentures interest expense bank lines of credit interest expense mortgage bonds and bank term loans interest expense other total interest expense before capitalized interest capitalized interest total interest expense the increase in total interest expense is primarily due to an increase in our long term debt 
our average balances of long term debt outstanding were approximately million and million for and  respectively 
this increase in our average debt was primarily driven by debt incurred in our acquisition of monarch utilities 
in addition  our weighted average borrowing rates increased to during from during gain on sales of land we recognized a million pretax gain on sales of surplus land in we recognized a million pretax gain on the sale of surplus land in provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was approximately for the years ended december  and compared to revenues utility group revenues in the utility group increased approximately million  or  to million during from million during the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to the favorable effect of rate increases in our california and texas utilities and increased customer connections in our new mexico and texas utilities 
the effect of increases in rates was partially offset by decreases in water consumption due to variations in weather in our california utility 
the changes are represented as follows in millions favorable effect of rate increase in revenues favorable effect of increase in connections reduction in water consumption net increase in revenue services group services group revenues for increased approximately million  or  to million from million during the prior year 
the increase is due to the following the acquisition of aqua services in november in november  we acquired certain contract operations of aquasource  inc  a provider of contract water and wastewater services in texas  colorado and south dakota 
upon closing of the transaction we began operating the majority of this business under the name aqua services  lp aqua services while the remaining part was incorporated into one of our existing subsidiaries 
revenues from aqua services were approximately million and million during and  respectively 
an increase in revenues of approximately million from the construction of a reverse osmosis water treatment facility in california to million during from million in an increase in revenues from our texas service operations of approximately million to million during from million during the prior year 
the revenue increase is largely attributable to increased tapping and inspection revenue driven by real estate development activity in texas 
operating expenses utility group operating expenses utility group represented approximately and of revenues from utility operations for and  respectively 
operating expenses were substantially unchanged from to  increasing million  or  to million during  from million during the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was due to the aforementioned increase in utility group revenues  which was primarily due to an increase in rates at our california utility 
additionally  a higher portion of the water we sold to our customers was produced from our own wells in  which has a lower cost than water purchased from outside sources 
the percentage of water used in our operations that was produced from our own wells was and during and  respectively  at our california utility 
this increase in water production related to two new wells that came on line in april and october of the aggregate cost of purchased and produced water in california was and per acre foot in and  respectively 
operating expenses incurred by our new mexico utility increased  or  during as compared to the city of albuquerque has increased sewage treatment rates approximately 
in addition  our new mexico utility has incurred additional fuel costs due to increased volume 
operating expenses at our california and texas utilities did not change in a significant amount 
services group operating expenses services group represented approximately and of the services group revenues for and  respectively 
operating expenses increased approximately million  or  to million during from million during the increase was due to the following the acquisition of aqua services in november  which generated operating costs of approximately million and million during and  respectively  and costs related to the construction of a reverse osmosis water treatment facility for the city of san juan capistrano  california which accounted for approximately million of the increase in operating expenses 
the remaining increase of approximately million for  compared to the prior year  resulted from increased operations and construction activity in the services group s operations 
the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenues in was primarily due to our project to construct and operate the reverse osmosis water treatment facility 
we are accounting for the project under the percentage of completion method during the construction phase 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or  to million for from million during the prior year 
the increase was largely due to the inclusion of approximately million from aqua services and the increased costs company wide for employee health benefits  insurance and compensation expenses 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from in to in other income expense interest expense the major components of interest expense for and are as follows for the years ended december  in millions interest expense convertible subordinate debentures interest expense bank lines of credit interest expense mortgage bonds and bank term loan interest expense other total interest expense before capitalized interest capitalized interest total interest expense we increased borrowings during the first six months of to finance capital improvements in our utility group 
our benefit from lower interest rates and higher capitalized interest from increased construction activity in our utility group was offset by higher borrowings on our bank lines of credit and increased interest expense related to our texas utility bank term loan 
in august  one of our texas utilities obtained a year  million secured bank term loan which increased our long term debt outstanding and  consequently  our interest expense 
our effective interest rates for and were and  respectively 
gain on sales of land we recognized a million pretax gain on the sale of surplus land in we recognized a million pretax gain on the sale of surplus land in other we report material events that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently  but not both  in other income expense rather than in operating income  in accordance with the provisions of apb no 
reporting the results of operations 
included in other income for is the effect of a non taxable gain of approximately million resulting from the termination of the company s defined benefit plan as more fully disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
there were no similar pension related gains in included in other income for is a million agreement reached among parties responsible for water contamination  the cooperating respondents  and our california utility regarding water quality related expenses incurred in  and see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in and subsequent years  such reimbursements are recorded as a reduction to operating expenses utility group 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate for was approximately compared to approximately for our effective tax rate for reflected the benefit of a one time gain on the termination of a pension plan  which was excluded from ordinary taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources our corporate objectives with respect to liquidity and capital resources are to i generate sufficient operating cash to provide for dividends  organic growth  principal and interest requirements  ordinary capital improvements  and taxes  ii obtain external financing for extraordinary capital improvement and acquisitions  iii utilize our credit facilities to manage seasonal cash needs  and iv maintain approximately equal levels of debt and equity 
our statements of cash flows are summarized as follows for the years ended december  in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by million in compared to despite lower net income 
this increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of increased revenues generated by our utility group  resulting from the monarch utilities acquisition  the benefit of increased water rates in the california utility  and connection growth in new mexico and texas  partially offset by the lower operating margin experienced by the services group and the higher sarbanes oxley compliance costs and other selling  general and administrative expenses 
operational aspects of our businesses that affected working capital in and are highlighted below we were able to utilize million more in cash balances which were previously restricted pending construction progress on the reverse osmosis water treatment facility  which was nearly completed during trade accounts receivable balances were higher by million due largely to increases in post acquisition receivables at monarch utilities and increased billings by subsidiaries performing multiple family utility billing and collection  water and wastewater quality testing and wholesale water sales services 
a million increase in prepaid insurance balances due primarily to the timing of payments 
an increase in other liabilities largely due to cash receipts associated with non refundable activation fees received from non regulated wholesale water operations 
these payments are deferred and recognized over the expected period of performance 
cash flows from investing activities cash used in investing activities totaled million in and was the result of acquisitions and capital improvements in our utility business 
capital expenditures of million were primarily invested in regulated water utility assets for purposes of expansion  replacement or renovation 
the following table summarizes property  plant and equipment additions for and for the years ended december  in millions company financed additions capital improvement reimbursements contributions paid for by developers total cash additions to property  plant and equipment property contributed by developers total additions to property  plant and equipment we made substantial investments in acquisitions during  including million in cash of the total million purchase price for monarch utilities  million to acquire the remaining minority interest of a services group subsidiary  and million in cash of the total million purchase price for  multiple family billing units in our utility submetering subsidiary 
cash flows from financing activities during  we demonstrated our ability to finance our growth through a broad range of capital initiatives  including a public offering of approximately million shares of our common stock in march  which generated net proceeds of approximately million  a million secured funded term loan tranche expansion to our bank lines of credit  a public offering of approximately million shares of our common stock in august  which generated net proceeds of approximately million  a million first mortgage bonds issuance  due in  with an interest rate of 
a portion of the proceeds were used to retire approximately million of our suburban first mortgage bonds which were due in  and a million first mortgage bonds issuance  due in  with an interest rate of 
a portion of the proceeds will be used to redeem million of our new mexico utilities series b first mortgage bonds which are due in aggregate borrowings under our revolving lines of credit increased by million as of the end of compared to due to the impact of lower fourth quarter cash flow 
our total borrowing availability under lines of credit was approximately million as of december  during  we paid dividends totaling approximately million 
our quarterly dividend rate is currently per common share 
common stockholders may elect to participate in our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan  which gives them the option of receiving their dividends in either cash or common stock at a discount from current market value 
this plan also permits optional cash purchases of stock at current market values of up to  per stockholder each quarter 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements other than leases that have been treated as operating leases in accordance with gaap 
contractual obligations a summary of our future contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  is as follows years ending december  and thereafter total in thousands long term debt bank lines of credit   bank term loan      economic development revenue bonds mortgage bonds    convertible subordinate debentures  notes payable     advances for construction  obligations under non cancellable operating leases   other   the convertible subordinate debentures are due in there are no put rights associated with the debentures 
we anticipate that mortgage bonds that come due in will be refinanced through the sale of new mortgage bonds or may be funded through our corporate credit facilities 
if we were unable to refinance these bonds or to raise capital to provide for these funds  our capital spending would be reduced or delayed  and any future acquisitions would be delayed or eliminated 
while we have the ability to take these actions  they could negatively impact our revenues  revenue growth  and profitability 
we anticipate that our available line of credit borrowing capacity and cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our activities during the next months 
if we were unable to renew our existing lines of credit or if we were unable to execute additional financing transactions  our capital spending and any future acquisitions would be delayed  reduced  or eliminated 
we have filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission  which is effective for the issuance of up to million aggregate principal amount of common stock  debt securities and warrants 
during  we issued approximately million of common stock under the shelf registration  and approximately million remains available for issuance as of december  we may offer any of these securities for sale at any time and from time to time 
on december   we had working capital of approximately million with available cash and cash equivalent balances of approximately million excluding restricted cash balances  as well as aggregate lines of credit totaling million consisting of three separate unsecured lines of credit from three commercial banks 
our total borrowing availability under lines of credit was approximately million on december  one line of credit expires in april  the other two expire in september for and  we had weighted average borrowing rates on our bank lines of credit of and  respectively 
in january  we entered into a reimbursement agreement with one of our commercial banks to secure a million standby letter of credit to guarantee our performance under a service contract to design and construct a reverse osmosis water treatment facility and associated wells 
upon acceptance of the completed project  expected in  the standby letter of credit and the related credit facility will be terminated 
in addition to our lines of credit  our california and new mexico indentures permit the issuance of approximately million of first mortgage bonds at our california and new mexico utilities as of december  however  the terms of our bank lines of credit do not permit additional first mortgage bond indebtedness without prior consent from participating bank lenders 
we expect to maintain our bank lines of credit in the normal course of business 
each of the line of credit agreements contains certain financial covenants 
during  we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under each of the line of credit agreements 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are important to fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition  valuation of long lived and intangible assets  accounting for regulated businesses  stock based compensation  deferred costs  and unusual events 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas which require management s judgment in selecting among available gaap alternatives 
our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition water utility revenues are recognized when water is delivered to customers 
at the end of an accounting period  estimated amounts for unbilled revenues are accrued for water usage since the previous billing period 
revenues for contract operations are recognized and billed at the end of the month based on a monthly fee to provide a specific level of service as outlined in each individual contract 
we generally bill for additional services provided beyond the scope of the base contract on a time and materials basis as such services are rendered 
revenues for construction projects are recorded using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion method recognizes revenue and income as work progresses on a project based on the expected total project costs and the expected total project revenues 
this method is based on an estimate of the revenue and income earned to date  less the revenue and income recognized in earlier periods 
if management anticipates we will ultimately suffer a loss on a construction project  the entire estimated loss is recorded in the period such a determination is made 
revenues for multiple family utility billing and collecting services are recognized and billed at the end of the month in which services are performed 
revenues for installation of multiple family utility billing and collection equipment are accounted for using the percentage of completion method 
if a contract involves the provision of a single product or service  revenue is generally recognized when the product or service is provided and the amount becomes billable 
if services are provided evenly during the contract term but service billings are irregular  revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the contract term 
certain non refundable activation fees in our non regulated wholesale water operations are accounted for on a completed contract basis and subsequently deferred and recognized over the expected period of performance 
if a contract involves the provision of multiple products or services elements  total estimated contract revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each service  provided the services qualify for separation under emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the amount of revenue allocated to each service is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of another element in the future 
revenue is then recognized for each element as described above for single element contracts  except revenue recognized on a straight line basis for a non construction service will not exceed amounts currently billable unless the excess revenue is recoverable from the client upon any contract termination event 
if the amount of revenue allocated to a construction service is less than its relative fair value  costs to deliver such service  limited to the difference between allocated revenue and the relative fair value  are deferred and amortized over the contract term 
if total construction service costs are estimated to exceed the relative fair value for the construction service contained in a multiple element arrangement  then a provision for the estimated loss is made in the period in which the loss first becomes apparent 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we assess intangible assets and other long lived assets  excluding goodwill  for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets 
if we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets or other long lived assets may not be recoverable  we measure impairment by using the projected discounted cash flow method in accordance with statement no 
we have made acquisitions in the past that resulted in recording goodwill and intangible assets 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment at least annually 
for intangible assets with finite useful lives  sfas no 
requires amortization over their estimated useful lives 
sfas no 
became effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company engaged an independent  professional valuation consultant to conduct a goodwill impairment review in accordance with sfas no 
we evaluated goodwill impairment using discounted cash flow methodologies  transaction values for comparable companies  and other valuation techniques for our reporting units with significant goodwill balances 
our reporting units  generally subsidiaries one level below operating segments  constitute separate businesses for which we maintain discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by segment and executive management 
there were no impairment charges to goodwill as of december  and no events have occurred that indicated diminution in the value of recorded goodwill 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  we have identified intangible assets apart from goodwill such as contract costs and account lists 
these intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from four to eight years 
accounting for regulated businesses our regulated businesses  which include our utilities in california  new mexico  and texas  are required to be accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  which specifies certain revenue  expense and balance sheet treatment as required by each state s regulatory authority 
each state authority establishes rates which are intended to permit each utility to recover its costs and earn a reasonable rate of return 
our services group has contracted with our utilities in texas  and new mexico to perform operating services  maintenance  construction work  and to manage capital projects 
in accordance with sfas no 
 our services group recognizes profit on sales to regulated affiliates and does not eliminate the intercompany profit when the sales price is reasonable and it is probable that  through the rate making process  future revenue approximately equal to the sales price will result from the regulated affiliate s use of the services 
however  all revenue in excess of profit is eliminated 
accordingly  the intercompany profit for construction as well as operations and maintenance services provided to utility group affiliates has not been eliminated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
based upon our services group s experience of providing operations and maintenance services in more than contracts with unaffiliated customers  and a history of regulator approval of the construction service fees charged by the services group to utility affiliates  we believe that the contract sales prices between our services group and our texas and new mexico utilities are reasonable and that it is probable that the price of these services will be recovered in the rate making process 
in  our california water utility recorded a balancing account receivable in the amount of approximately million  representing the difference between actual water production costs incurred and cpuc adopted water production costs 
historically  the cpuc allowed such balancing accounts in the income statements of water utilities  with a corresponding liability or asset on the balance sheet 
on july   the cpuc issued a decision that allows our water utility in california to collect the million balancing account and an additional under collection of approximately million for a total of million 
the million increase in the balancing account receivable was recorded in the third quarter of the cpuc decision provides for us to recover the settlement amount through a surcharge billed to customers 
approximately million of the additional amount was recorded as a reduction in operating expenses in the third quarter of  and the remaining million was recorded as interest income 
stock based compensation in  we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which requires valuation of stock options issued based upon an option pricing model and recognition of this value as an expense over the period in which the options vest 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we elected to recognize stock based compensation using the retroactive restatement method 
under this change in accounting method  we restated our accompanying consolidated financial statements for periods prior to to reflect stock based compensation expense under a fair value based accounting method for all options granted  modified or settled in fiscal years beginning after december  we use the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of our stock options 
this option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that do not have vesting restrictions and that are fully transferable 
option valuation models require subjective assumptions such as the expected future volatility of the stock price 
because the stock options we grant have characteristics that are significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the calculated results  in management s opinion  the stock option valuation models  including black scholes  may not necessarily provide an exact measure of the fair value of employee stock options 
deferred costs we defer and subsequently amortize certain direct contract acquisition costs related to activities that enable the provision of contracted services to our customers 
deferred contract acquisition costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining original contract term unless revenue patterns indicate a more accelerated method is appropriate 
the recoverability of all long lived assets associated with a particular contract  including deferred contract costs  is analyzed on a periodic basis 
if we conclude that long lived assets are impaired  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived assets exceeds the fair value of those assets 
unusual events we report material events that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently  but not both  in other income expense rather than in operating income  in accordance with the provisions of apb no 
reporting the results of operations 
apb no 
provides that unusual or infrequent events are separately disclosed and excluded from operating income  and that the nature and financial effects of each event or transaction should be disclosed on the face of the income statement 
included in other income on our consolidated statements of income is the effect of a non taxable gain in of approximately million resulting from the termination of our defined benefit plan as more fully disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
also included in other income for is a million cost reimbursement we received as a result of an agreement reached among parties responsible for water contamination and our california utility regarding water quality related expenses incurred in  and recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r replaces sfas no 
and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
generally  sfas no 
r is similar in approach to sfas no 
and requires that compensation cost relating to share based payments be recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
we must adopt sfas no 
r by the third quarter of we adopted sfas no 
in and do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
r to have a material effect on our stock based compensation expense 
in september  the emerging issues task force issued eitf issue no 
accounting issues related to certain features of contingently convertible debt and the effect on diluted earnings per share 
the pronouncement pertains to all issued securities that have embedded market price contingent conversion features and therefore  applies to contingently convertible debt  contingently convertible preferred stock  and instrument c in eitf  convertible bonds with issuer option to settle for cash upon conversion 
the eitf addresses when the dilutive effect of these securities with a market price trigger should be included in diluted earnings per share eps 
the pronouncement is effective for all periods ending after december  and would be applied by retroactively restating previously reported eps 
our convertible debentures do not have a contingent price trigger and the guidance did not have an impact on our computation of earnings per share 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have certain indebtedness that is subject to variable rate interest 
as a result  southwest water s interest expense is affected by changes in the general level of interest rates 
the interest expense paid on our line of credit borrowings and certain term loans is determined based upon a rate formula that fluctuates with short term libor rates and the banks prime lending rates 
as of december   we had million of long term debt outstanding 
this amount includes variable rate debt totaling million with a weighted average interest rate of 
a hypothetical one percent basis points increase in the average interest rate on our variable rate debt would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million 
the fair value of our long term debt was approximately million at december  the carrying value of the company s bank lines of credit approximates fair value
