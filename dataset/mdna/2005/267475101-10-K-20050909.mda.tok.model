overview we are a leading provider of specialty contracting services 
these services are provided throughout the united states and include engineering  construction  maintenance and installation services to telecommunications providers  underground locating services to various utilities including telecommunications providers  and other construction and maintenance services to electric utilities and others 
for the fiscal year ended july   specialty contracting services related to the telecommunications industry  underground utility locating  and electric and other construction and maintenance to electric utilities and others contributed approximately   and  respectively  to our total revenues 
we conduct our operations primarily through our subsidiaries 
our revenues may fluctuate as a result of changes in the capital expenditure and maintenance budgets of our customers  and changes in the general level of construction activity 
the capital expenditure and maintenance budgets of our telecommunications customers may be impacted by consumer demands on telecom providers  actions of the federal communications commission and the introduction of new communication technologies  while the balance of our services are primarily impacted by general economic conditions 
a significant portion of our services are covered by multi year master service agreements  and we are currently a party to over of these agreements 
master service agreements generally have the following characteristics contract periods of one or more years  exclusivity and customer specified service requirements 
exclusivity often has a number of exceptions  including but not limited to  the ability by the customer to issue to others work orders valued above a specified dollar limit  the self performance of the work by the customer s in house workforce if available  and the ability to use others when jointly placing facilities with another utility 
in addition  master service agreements typically provide that we will furnish a specified unit of service for a specified unit price eg  fiber optic cable will be installed underground for a specified rate of dollars per foot 
in most cases  a customer may terminate these agreements for convenience with written notice 
the remainder of our services is provided pursuant to contracts for particular jobs 
long term contracts relate to specific projects with terms in excess of one year from the contract date 
short term contracts generally are three to four months in duration 
a portion of our contracts include retainage provisions under which to of the contract invoicing is withheld subject to project completion and acceptance by the customer 

table of contents the following table summarizes our revenues from long term contracts  including multi year master service agreements  as a percentage of total revenue of revenue fiscal year ended july  july  multi year master service agreements other long term contracts total long term contracts the percentage increase in revenue derived from long term contracts  including multi year master service agreements  is primarily due to agreements in place at utiliquest which was acquired in december many of the utiliquest agreements are multi year master service agreements which have increased the number of multi year service agreements as a percentage of all total long term contracts 
we recognize revenue using the units of delivery or cost to cost measures of the percentage of completion method of accounting 
revenues from services provided to customers are recognized when services are performed 
the majority of our contracts are based on units of delivery and revenue is recognized as each unit is completed 
revenue from other contracts is recognized using the cost to cost measures of the percentage of completion method and is based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs 
we derive a significant amount of our revenue from telecommunications companies 
during fiscal and into fiscal  certain segments of the telecommunications industry suffered a severe downturn that resulted in certain of our customers experiencing financial difficulties 
several of our customers filed for bankruptcy protection  including adelphia communications corporation adelphia and worldcom  inc worldcom 
the downturn in the telecommunications industry in fiscal and adversely affected capital expenditures for infrastructure projects even among our customers that did not experience financial difficulties 
generally  these situations eased in fiscal and although we do not believe that any of our significant customers are experiencing significant financial difficulty as of july   additional bankruptcies of companies in the telecommunications sector could reduce our revenues and adversely impact our liquidity 
in addition  master service agreements can generally be terminated by these customers on short notice regardless of financial difficulties or other considerations 
a significant portion of our revenue comes from several large customers 
the following table reflects the percentage of total revenue from customers contributing at least of our total revenue for either fiscal or fiscal year ended july  july  july  verizon bellsouth comcast sprint qwest charter directv alltel adelphia cost of earned revenues includes all the direct costs of providing services under our contracts  including those for construction personnel  subcontractors  operation of capital equipment excluding depreciation  and insurance 
for the majority of our contracts  our customers provide the materials that are to be used and we 
table of contents provide the personnel  tools  and equipment to perform the installation and maintenance services 
the materials supplied by our customers are not included in our revenue or costs of sales as the customer retains the financial and performance risk associated with the materials 
we retain the risk  up to certain limits  for automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation  locate damage claims  and employee group health claims 
locate damage claims result from property and other damages arising in connection with our utility locating services 
a change in claims experience or actuarial assumptions related to these risks could materially affect our results of operations 
general and administrative costs include all of our costs at the corporate level  as well as costs of our subsidiaries management personnel and administrative overhead 
our executive management  including senior managers of our subsidiaries  performs substantially all sales and marketing functions as part of their management responsibilities and  accordingly  we have not incurred material sales and marketing expenses 
acquisitions on september   we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of rje telecom inc rje for a cash purchase price of approximately million 
rje provides specialty contracting services primarily to telephone companies 
on december   we acquired utiliquest for a cash purchase price of approximately million 
utiliquest is a provider of underground locating services 
in connection with the acquisition of utiliquest  we borrowed approximately million under our previous credit agreement 
this amount was repaid during fiscal on november   we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain of the liabilities associated with those assets of first south utility construction  inc first south 
first south provided specialty contracting services to telecommunications customers 
consideration consisted of approximately million in cash  adjusted for cash we received from the settlement of an escrow agreement in fiscal  and  shares of our common stock valued at approximately million 
in conjunction with the first south acquisition  we also paid approximately million for excess working capital consisting primarily of accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings 
as part of our growth strategy  we may acquire companies that expand  complement  or diversify our business 
we regularly review opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible acquisitions 
our ability to sustain our growth and maintain our competitive position may be affected by our ability to successfully integrate any businesses acquired 
outlook we are a provider of specialty contracting services  primarily to the telecommunications industry 
the telecommunications industry has undergone and continues to undergo significant changes due to governmental deregulation  advances in technology  increased competition as the telephone and cable industries converge  and growing consumer demand for enhanced and bundled services 
as a result of these factors  the networks of our customers increasingly face demands for more capacity and greater reliability which in turn  increase the needs of our customers for our services 
telecommunications network operators are increasingly relying on the deployment of fiber optic cable technology deeper into their networks and closer to consumers in order to respond to demands for capacity  reliability  and product bundles of voice  video  and high speed data services 
fiber deployments have enabled an increasing number of cable companies to begin to offer voice services in addition to their traditional video and data services 
fiber deployments are also beginning to facilitate the provisioning of video services by local telephone companies in addition to their traditional voice and high speed data services 
during and  several large telephone companies announced fiber to the premise and fiber to the node initiatives as a means to begin to actively compete with cable operators 
these initiatives have resulted in an increase in demand for our services 
this increase in demand for fiber deployments has been accompanied by the telecommunications industry s general recovery from the severe downturn which occurred during and we believe the latest developments and trends in the telecommunications industry support our outlook for growth 
consistent with historical practice  telecommunications providers have continued to outsource a 
table of contents significant portion of their engineering  construction and maintenance requirements in order to reduce their investment in capital equipment  provide flexibility in workforce sizing  expand product offerings without large increases in incremental hiring and focus on those competencies they consider core to business success 
we also provide underground utility locating services to a variety of utility companies including telecommunication providers 
underground excavation is involved in a substantial portion of overall economic activity including the construction and maintenance of telephone  cable television  power and gas utility networks  the construction and maintenance of roads and highways as well as the construction of new and existing commercial and residential projects 
in most if not all instances  utility line locating is required prior to underground excavation 
this requirement along with the pace of overall economic activity primarily influences the demand for our utility line locating services 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  allowance for doubtful accounts  self insured claims liability  valuation of goodwill and intangible assets  asset lives used in computing depreciation and amortization  including amortization of intangibles  and accounting for income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
application of these estimates and assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to the accounting for our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations because they involve making significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the impact of these policies on our operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
we have discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below  are also critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies described herein  and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue using the units of delivery or cost to cost measures of the percentage of completion method of accounting 
revenues from services provided to customers are recognized when services are performed 
the majority of our contracts are based on units of delivery and revenue is recognized as each unit is completed 
revenue from other contracts is recognized using cost to cost measures of the percentage of completion method and is based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs 
contract costs include the direct costs of providing services under our contracts  including those for construction personnel  subcontractors  operation of capital equipment excluding depreciation  and insurance 
our customers generally provide the materials that are to be used for a particular contract  and we provide the personnel  tools  and equipment to perform the installation services 
the materials supplied by our customers are not included in our revenue or costs of sales as the customer retains the financial and performance risk associated with the materials 
the current asset costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed 
the current liability billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings represents billings in excess of revenues recognized 

table of contents application of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires the use of estimates of costs to be incurred for the performance of the contract 
the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our project managers and financial professionals 
factors that we consider in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the effect of change orders  the availability of materials  the effect of any delays in performance and the recoverability of any claims 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and their effects are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated ultimate loss is accrued 
self insured claims liability 
we retain the risk  up to certain limits  for automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation  locate damage claims  and employee health claims 
a liability for unpaid claims and the associated claim expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  is actuarially determined and reflected in the consolidated financial statements as accrued self insured claims 
locate damage claims result from property and other damages arising in connection with our utility locating services 
as of july   the liability for self insured claims was million compared to million at july  based on past experience  we expect million to be paid in the next months 
we estimate and develop claims based on facts  circumstances and historical evidence 
when loss reserves are recorded they are not discounted  even though they may not be paid until some time in the future 
factors affecting the determination of amounts to be accrued for self insured claims include  but are not limited to  the expected cost for existing and incurred but not reported claims  the frequency of claims  the frequency of use of our health plan by participants  the payment patterns for incurred claims  the hazard level of our operations  the overall level of medical cost inflation  changes in the medical conditions of claimants  economic factors such as inflation  tort reform or other legislative changes  unfavorable jury decisions and court interpretations 
the calculation of the estimated accrued liability for self insured claims is subject to inherent uncertainty 
for losses occurring in fiscal  we have retained the risk to million on a per occurrence basis for workers compensation and for automobile liability 
for general liability we have retained the risk to  except with respect to our utiliquest subsidiary for which we have retained the risk to million for general liability for fiscal within our umbrella coverage  we have retained the risk of loss for automobile liability and general liability and damage claims between and million  on a per occurrence basis  with an aggregate stop loss for this layer of million for fiscal these retention amounts apply in those states in which we operate and are allowed to retain the risk 
for fiscal  we had an aggregate stop loss coverage for these exposures at a stated retention of approximately million and umbrella liability coverage to a policy limit of million 
for losses occurring in fiscal year  we will retain the same risk amounts as for fiscal  except that we will have an aggregate stop loss coverage for these exposures at a stated retention of approximately million and an umbrella liability coverage policy limit of million 
for losses under our self insured employee health plan occurring during fiscal  we have retained the risk  on an annual basis  of  per participant 
for fiscal  we had an aggregate stop loss coverage for this exposure at the stated retention of approximately million 
the methods of calculating the estimated accrued liabilities for self insured claims are subject to inherent uncertainty 
if actual results significantly differ from estimates used to calculate the liability  our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows could be materially impacted 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 
as of july   we had million of goodwill  million of indefinite lived intangible assets and million of finite lived intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization 
our reporting units are tested in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair market value 
should this be the case  the value of our goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets may be impaired and written down 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are 
table of contents also tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests which indicate that the asset might be impaired 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets  we review finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change which indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
determination of recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for goodwill and intangible assets is based on the fair value of the asset compared to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the asset is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss would be incurred in an amount equal to the difference 
impairment losses  if any  are reflected in operating income or loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
we use judgment in assessing goodwill and intangible assets for impairment 
estimates of fair value are based on our best estimate of future cash flows from revenue and operating costs of each reporting unit considering historical and anticipated future results  general economic and market conditions as well as the impact of planned business or operational strategies 
the valuations employ a combination of present value techniques to measure fair value and consider market factors 
generally  we engage third party specialists to assist us with our valuations 
these valuations are based on a discount rate determined by our management to be consistent with industry discount rates and the risks inherent in our current business model 
changes in our judgments and estimates could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units and could result in an impairment of goodwill 
during  as the result of our annual impairment analysis  we determined that the goodwill of our white mountain cable construction subsidiary was impaired 
the recent under performance of the subsidiary s financial results  combined with a reduction in the future expected cash flows from this subsidiary  resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million 
should future results of our reporting units or economic events cause a change in our projected cash flows or other assumptions  or should our business or operational strategies change  future determinations of fair value may not support the carrying amount of one or more of our reporting units  and the related goodwill would need to be written down to an amount considered recoverable 
stock based compensation 
our stock option program is intended to attract  retain and provide incentives for talented employees  officers and directors  and to align stockholder and employee interests 
as of july   we had five stock based compensation plans 
as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we accounted for stock based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
no compensation expense was recognized for employee stock options  because it was our practice to grant stock options with an exercise price equal to the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of options at grant date was estimated using the black scholes multiple option model 
changes in any of the assumptions used in this model for fiscal expected life of years  a weighted average risk free interest rate of  weighted average volatility of and no expected dividends  would change the weighted average per share fair value of 
the assumptions we used are based upon our historical experience  however future results could differ from these assumptions 
on july   our compensation committee approved the accelerated vesting of all unvested stock options granted under the incentive stock option plan and the long term incentive plan to employees and officers having per share exercise prices equal to or greater than the closing market price on july  
each of these options became fully vested 
approximately million options to purchase shares became exercisable immediately as a result of the vesting acceleration 
in the case of officers at or above the level of senior vice president  the compensation committee imposed a holding period that will require the optionees to refrain from selling common stock acquired upon the exercise of these options other than shares needed to cover the exercise price and satisfying withholding taxes until the date on which the exercise would have been permitted under the option s original vesting terms 
the primary purpose of the accelerated vesting was to eliminate future compensation expense we would have otherwise recognized in our consolidated statements of operations with respect to these accelerated options upon the adoption sfas no 
r  share based payment see note  accounting for stock based compensation and 
table of contents note  recently issued accounting pronouncements 
the acceleration of the vesting of these options did not result in a charge based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the acceleration resulted in the recognition of an additional million pre tax expense included in the pro forma disclosures of stock based compensation in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the exclusion of such amounts from compensation expense in future years 
if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
to stock based employee compensation  our net earnings for the fiscal year ended july  would have been million or per diluted share  which includes the compensation expense related to the accelerated options 
based on the remaining unvested options at july   we expect to incur non cash compensation expense of approximately million during fiscal accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
developing our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment regarding the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
we have not recorded any valuation allowances as of july  because management believes that future taxable income will  more likely than not  be sufficient to realize the benefits of those assets as the temporary basis differences reverse over time 
our judgments are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while we believe that we have provided adequately for our income tax liabilities in the consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
management analyzes the collectability of accounts receivable balances each period 
this review considers the aging of account balances  historical bad debt experience  changes in customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  customer payment activity and other relevant factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimate made by management may also change  which could affect the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts 
we record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when it is probable that a receivable is not collectable and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we believe that none of our significant customers are experiencing significant financial difficulty as of july  any increase in the allowance account has a corresponding negative effect on our results of operations 
contingencies and litigation 
in the ordinary course of our business  we are involved in certain legal proceedings 
sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
if only a range of probable loss can be determined  we accrue for our best estimate within the range for the contingency 
in those cases where none of the estimates within the range is better than another  we accrue for the amount representing the low end of the range in accordance with sfas no 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
revisions of our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations 
additionally  if the final outcome of such litigation and contingencies differs adversely from that currently expected  it would result in a charge to earnings when determined 
the federal employment tax returns for two of our subsidiaries have been audited by the internal revenue service irs 
as a result of the audit  we received a proposed assessment from the irs in march at issue  according to the examination reports  are the taxpayers characterization of certain employee reimbursements for the calendar years and we reached an agreed assessment with the irs regarding one of the two subsidiaries 
the amount of the agreed assessment  which was paid during fiscal  was recorded against the accrual we established in fiscal subsequent to this agreement  million of the proposed assessment is still at issue 
we continue to disagree with the amount of the proposed assessment with respect to the other subsidiary and are pursuing an administrative appeal for this 
table of contents matter which we intend to vigorously defend 
we believe we have a number of legal defenses available that may substantially reduce the proposed assessment and have therefore not recorded any significant liability with respect to the remaining assessment

this decrease in telecommunications service revenues was primarily attributable to revenues from two customers that are completing upgrade projects to their networks and a decline in revenue from a construction and maintenance contract with a significant customer 
the decrease was offset in part by revenues from one of our significant customers engaged in a fiber deployment project  and general increases in construction activities for other telecommunications customers 
excluding the revenue of utiliquest for each fiscal period  revenues from underground utility locating services for fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal  an increase of 
this increase is primarily the result of additional work performed for existing customers 
the increase was impacted by reduced demand during the first quarter of fiscal in the southern united states due to poor weather conditions 
our total revenues from electric utilities and other construction and maintenance services increased million  or for fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to electric maintenance contracts that were in the start up phase in fiscal this increase was offset in part by the completion of a customer contract in the southeastern united states during fiscal cost of earned revenues 
costs of earned revenues increased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in cost of earned revenues was primarily the result of increased levels of operations during the period 
the primary components of this dollar increase were direct labor  subcontractor costs  direct materials  equipment and other direct costs which increased million  million  million and million  respectively  due to higher levels of operations during fiscal labor and labor related costs  including subcontractor costs  as a percentage of cost of earned revenues remained constant at in fiscal and fiscal as a percentage of revenues  costs of earned revenues increased for fiscal as compared to fiscal included in cost of earned revenues for fiscal was a million charge recorded to payroll tax expense in connection with a federal employment tax audit 
excluding this charge  costs of earned revenues as a percentage of revenues increased for fiscal as compared to fiscal this change included increases of for direct labor and for subcontractor costs 
these increases were in part the result of higher utility locating services as a percentage of total revenue which generally has higher labor costs as a percentage of cost of earned revenue 
we also incurred difficult weather conditions during the first quarter of fiscal  additional costs associated with the ramp up of activities for a fiber deployment project of a significant customer  and additional costs associated with the demobilization activities for a significant customer that is completing an upgrade project to its broadband network 

table of contents general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily a result of increased operational activity and increased professional fees related to our sarbanes oxley compliance efforts 
fiscal includes a charge of approximately million associated with a legal judgment and related expenses that resulted from a contract dispute that arose from the pre acquisition operations of one of our subsidiaries 
the percentage decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the relatively fixed nature of the expenses in relation to the higher revenues during fiscal compared to fiscal bad debt expense 
bad debt expense was million in both fiscal and fiscal depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  and decreased as a percentage of revenues to from 
the dollar increase was primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization from property and equipment and intangible assets related to the fiscal acquisition of rje and a full year of depreciation and amortization for the fiscal year acquisitions of utiliquest and first south  as well as increased levels of capital expenditures during the second half of fiscal and during fiscal goodwill impairment charge 
during  as the result of our annual impairment analysis  we determined that the goodwill of our white mountain cable construction subsidiary was impaired 
the recent under performance of the subsidiary s financial results  combined with a reduction in the future expected cash flows from this subsidiary  resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was determined based on our best estimate of future cash flows from revenue and operating costs considering historical and anticipated future results  general economic and market conditions as well as the impact of planned business and operational strategies 
gain on sale of accounts receivable 
in fiscal  we sold adelphia accounts receivable and recorded an million gain on the sale 
those receivables had a book value of approximately million  reflecting a write down of million in fiscal relating to the bankruptcy of adelphia 
interest income 
interest income increased to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the increase in interest income primarily reflects higher interest rates compared to those in the prior period  partially offset by lower levels of cash and cash equivalents in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decrease was due to prior year borrowings in connection with the utiliquest acquisition which were repaid during the third quarter of fiscal and the pay down of capital lease obligations 
other income  net 
other income  which primarily includes net gains on the sale of idle assets  increased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase was a combination of greater numbers of assets sold during the current fiscal year  as well as improved pricing for those assets 
income taxes 
the following table presents our income tax expense and effective income tax rate for fiscal and fiscal fiscal year ended july  july  dollars in millions income taxes effective income tax rate our effective income tax rate increased as a result of the non cash goodwill impairment charge of million in fiscal see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements which was a non deductible item for income tax purposes 
the remaining change in our effective income tax rate was 
table of contents attributable to fluctuations in non deductible and non taxable items for tax purposes in relation to our pre tax income and fluctuations in state apportionment rates 
net income 
net income was million in fiscal as compared to a million in fiscal year ended compared july  compared to year ended july  revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal of this increase  million was attributable to an increase in demand for specialty contracting services provided to telecommunications companies  an increase of million in underground utility locating services revenues and an increase of million attributable to electric utilities and other construction and maintenance services revenues 
utiliquest  acquired in december  contributed million of underground utility locating service revenues during fiscal first south  acquired in november  contributed million of revenues during fiscal in telecommunication services revenue 
excluding revenues from utiliquest and first south our total revenues for fiscal would have been million compared to million for fiscal  an increase of 
revenue also increased due to weeks of results included in fiscal compared to weeks of results in fiscal during fiscal  we recognized million of revenues  or of our total revenues  from telecommunications services as compared to million  or  for fiscal first south contributed million of revenues from telecommunications services for fiscal excluding revenue from first south  revenues from telecommunications services for fiscal would have been million compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase in our telecommunications service revenues  excluding the impact of first south  was attributable to a general increase in contract activity from a broad range of our customers as well as revenues from one of our significant customers engaged in a major upgrade project  the impact of a major new construction and maintenance contract with a significant customer and the commencement of a significant upgrade project with a telephone company 
we recognized revenues of million  or of our total revenues  from underground utility locating services for fiscal as compared to million  or  for fiscal utiliquest contributed million of revenue for underground utility locating services for fiscal excluding revenue from utiliquest for underground utility locating services revenues for fiscal would have been million compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily the result of receiving a new contract award in the southeastern united states from an existing customer 
we recognized revenues of million  or of our total revenues  from electric utilities and other construction and maintenance services for fiscal  as compared to million or for fiscal this represents an increase of million  or  from fiscal and was primarily related to revenues from a new electrical maintenance master service agreement entered into with a customer during fiscal revenues from multi year master service agreements and other long term agreements represented of total revenues in fiscal as compared to in fiscal revenues from multi year master services agreements represented of total revenues in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the increase was primarily due to agreements in place at utiliquest which we acquired in december cost of earned revenues 
costs of earned revenues increased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal and decreased as a percentage of revenues to from 
the primary components of this dollar increase were subcontractor costs  direct labor and other direct costs which increased  and million  respectively  due to higher levels of operations during fiscal as a percentage of revenues  cost of earned revenue decreased due to improving claims experience under our self insurance program for general liability claims and due to reduced costs incurred for direct materials in proportion to the increased level of operations 
these decreases were partially offset by an approximate increase in subcontractor labor cost which rose on a percentage basis in response to the increased work demand and the shift in the business mix toward operating units that utilize more subcontract labor 
in addition  equipment costs rose by approximately as a percentage of revenues primarily due to increased equipment costs related to the increase in utility locating operations 
other direct costs increased in

net income was million in fiscal as compared to a million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources capital requirements 
we primarily use capital to purchase equipment to support our contractual commitments to customers and to maintain sufficient working capital 
our working capital needs are influenced by the level of operations during the period and generally increase with higher levels of revenues 
additionally  our working capital requirements are influenced by the timing of the collection of balances outstanding from our customers for work previously performed 
our sources of cash have historically been operating activities  equity offerings  bank borrowings  and proceeds from the sale of idle and surplus equipment and real property 
to the extent we seek to grow by acquisitions that involve consideration other than our stock  our capital requirements may increase

additionally  during fiscal we borrowed million under our credit agreement in connection with the utiliquest acquisition and repaid the borrowings during the third quarter of fiscal for fiscal  net cash provided in financing activities of million primarily consisting of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
during the second quarter of fiscal we entered into a new five year million revolving unsecured credit agreement the credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that replaced our prior credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides us with a commitment of million for a five year period expiring on december   and includes a million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit 
as of july   we had million of outstanding letters of credit issued under the credit agreement 
the outstanding letters of credit are all issued to insurance companies as part of our self insurance program 
at july  we had no other borrowings under our credit agreement 
the credit agreement requires that we maintain certain financial covenants and imposes certain conditions including restricting our ability to encumber assets or incur certain types of indebtedness 
we must maintain a leverage ratio of not greater than and maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than  as measured at the end of each fiscal quarter 
we must also maintain consolidated tangible net worth of not less than million plus the sum of i of consolidated net income if positive from december  to the date of computation and ii of the equity issuances made from december  to the date of computation 
at july   we were in compliance with all financial covenants and conditions under the credit agreement 
at our option  loans under the credit agreement bear interest  at either the bank s base rate or libor  plus a spread 
this spread is predicated upon our current leverage ratio 
the bank s base rate is the greater of the lead bank s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 
currently  the rate of interest applicable to our borrowings would be at the bank s base rate or libor plus a spread of 
we deferred approximately million of fees in fiscal related to the credit agreement  which are being amortized over its five year term 
additionally  we are required to pay a quarterly facility fee  at rates that range from to of 
table of contents the unutilized commitments depending on our leverage ratio 
however  in the event we are utilizing less than one third of the facility the fee will be 
of the unutilized commitments 
obligations under the agreement are guaranteed by certain of our material subsidiaries 
certain subsidiaries have outstanding obligations under real estate leases and equipment and vehicle financing arrangements 
the obligations are payable in monthly installments  expiring at various dates through november contractual arrangements the following tables set forth our contractual commitments for each of our fiscal years through and thereafter  including related party leases  as of july  notes and loans capital operating employment payable leases leases agreements total dollars in thousands thereafter total related party transactions 
we lease a portion of our administrative offices from officers of our subsidiaries or entities related to officers of subsidiaries 
the total expense under these arrangements for fiscal and fiscal was million and million  respectively 
the future minimum lease commitments under these arrangements during each fiscal year through fiscal and thereafter are dollars in thousands thereafter total sufficiency of capital resources 
we believe that our capital resources  together with existing cash balances  are sufficient to meet our financial obligations  including lease commitments  and to support our normal replacement of equipment at our current level of business for at least the next twelve months 
our future operating results and cash flows may be affected by a number of factors including our success in bidding on future contracts and our ability to manage controllable costs effectively 
backlog 
our backlog is comprised of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under job specific contracts and the estimated value of future services that we expect to provide under long term requirements contracts  including master service agreements 
in many instances our customers are not contractually committed to specific volumes of services under a contract 
however  the customer is obligated once the services are requested by the customer and provided by us 
many of our contracts are multi year agreements  and we include in our backlog the amount of services projected to be performed over the terms of the contracts based on our historical relationships with customers and our experience in procurements of this nature 
for certain recently initiated multi year projects relating to fiber deployments for one of our significant customers  we have included in backlog only those amounts relating to calendar year we have taken this 
table of contents approach with respect to these fiber deployment projects because  when initially installed  they are not required for the day to day provision of services by our customer 
consequently  these programs have generally been subject to more uncertainty  as compared to those of our other customers  with regards to budgets and activity levels 
our estimates of a customer s requirements during a particular future period may not be accurate at any point in time 
our backlog at july  and july  was billion and billion  respectively 
we expect to complete approximately of our current backlog during the next twelve months 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations our revenues are affected by seasonality 
most of our work is performed outdoors and as a result  our results of operations are impacted by extended periods of inclement weather 
generally  inclement weather occurs during the winter season which falls during our second and third quarters of the fiscal year 
in addition  a disproportionate percentage of total holidays fall within our second quarter  which impacts the number of available workdays 
in addition  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience quarterly variations in revenues and net income as a result of other factors  including the timing and volume of customers construction and maintenance projects  budgetary spending patterns of customers  the commencement or termination of master service agreements and other long term agreements with customers  costs incurred to support growth internally or through acquisitions  fluctuation in results of operations caused by acquisitions  changes in mix of customers  contracts  and business activities  and fluctuations in insurance expense due to changes in claims experience and actuarial assumptions 
accordingly  operating results for any fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for any subsequent fiscal period 

table of contents risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below  together with all of the other information in this form k 
if any of the following risks actually occur  or other risks not presently known to us or that we do not currently believe to be significant do develop and occur  our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
demand for our services is cyclical  dependent in large part on the telecommunications industry and could be adversely affected by an economic slowdown 
demand for our services has been  and will likely continue to be  cyclical in nature and vulnerable to general downturns in the us economy 
in fiscal  our telecommunications customers accounted for of our revenues 
in fiscal and the first half of fiscal  certain segments of the telecommunications industry suffered a severe downturn that resulted in a number of our customers experiencing financial difficulties 
several of our customers filed for bankruptcy protection  including adelphia and worldcom 
additional bankruptcies or financial difficulties of companies in the telecommunications sector could reduce our cash flows and adversely impact our liquidity and profitability 
during times of economic slowdown  the customers in the industries we serve often reduce their capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending infrastructure projects 
such developments occur even among customers that are not experiencing financial difficulties 
future economic slowdowns in the industries we serve may impair the financial condition of some of our customers  which may cause them to reduce their capital expenditures and demand for our specialty contracting services and may hinder their ability to pay us on a timely basis or at all 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from master service agreements  which may be cancelled upon short notice  and we may be unsuccessful in replacing these agreements as they are completed or expire 
we currently derive a significant portion of our revenues from master service agreements 
by their terms  the majority of these contracts may be cancelled by our customers upon short notice  even if we are not in default under these agreements 
in addition  projected expenditures by customers under these agreements are not assured until such time as a definitive work order is placed and completed 
if a significant customer cancels its master services agreement with us and we were unable to replace the agreement with another on similar terms  our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected 
recently we have been able to extend some of these agreements on negotiated terms 
market conditions could change  however  and we may not be able to continue to obtain or extend master services agreements through negotiation  and we may be underbid by competitors in an ensuing competitive bidding process 
the loss of work obtained through master service agreements could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
the industries we serve are subject to rapid technological and structural changes that could reduce the need for our services and adversely affect our revenues 
the telecommunications industry is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and changing customer needs 
we generate a significant portion of our revenues from customers in the telecommunications industry 
new technology or upgrades to existing technology available to our customers or to our customers competitors could reduce the need for our services and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
new or developing services  such as wireless applications  could displace the wireline systems used by our customers to deliver services to consumers 
in addition  improvements in existing technology may allow telecommunication companies to improve their networks without physically upgrading them 
additionally  consolidations  mergers and acquisitions in the telecommunications industry have occurred in the past and may occur in the future 
these consolidations  mergers and acquisitions may cause the loss of one or more of our customers 
reduced demand for our services or a loss of a significant customer could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a few customers  and the loss of one or more of these customers could adversely impact our revenues and profitability 
our customer base is highly concentrated  with our top five customers in each of fiscal years   and accounting for approximately of our total revenues 
a significant portion of the work we perform for these customers is commissioned under master services agreements  which may be terminated on short notice  even if we are not in default under these agreements 
in addition  revenues under our contracts with these customers may vary from period to period 
table of contents depending on the timing and volume of work which such customers order in a given period and as a result of competition from the in house service organizations of our customers 
reduced demand for our services or a loss of a significant customer could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
the specialty contracting services industry in which we operate is highly competitive 
we compete with other independent contractors  including several that are large domestic companies that may have financial  technical and marketing resources that exceed our own 
our competitors may develop the expertise  experience and resources to provide services that are equal or superior in both price and quality to our services  and we may not be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position 
we may also face competition from the in house service organizations of our existing or prospective customers  particularly telecommunications providers  which employ personnel who perform some of the same types of services as we provide 
although our customers currently outsource a significant portion of these services to us and our competitors  we can offer no assurance that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource specialty contracting services to us in the future 
in addition  there are relatively few barriers to entry into the markets in which we operate and  as a result  any organization with adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become a competitor 
our profitability is based on our ability to deliver our services within the costs and estimates used to establish the pricing of our contracts 
most of our long term contracts are based on units of delivery  and we recognize revenue as the unit of delivery is completed 
as the price for each of the units is fixed by the contract  our profitability could decline if our actual costs to complete each unit exceeds our original estimates 
revenue from other contracts is recognized using cost to cost measures of the percentage of completion method and is based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs 
application of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires that our management estimate the costs to be incurred by us in performing the contract 
our process for estimating costs is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our project managers and financial professionals 
however  any changes in original estimates  or the assumptions underpinning such estimates  may result in revisions to costs and income and their effects would be recognized in the period during which such revisions were determined 
these changes could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits  which could adversely affect our profitability and the price of our common stock 
we have a significant amount of accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings assets 
we grant credit to our customers  which include telephone companies  cable television multiple system operators  a direct broadcast satellite operator  and other gas and electric utilities 
at year end fiscal  we had net accounts receivable of million and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings of million 
we periodically assess the credit of our customers and continuously monitor the timeliness of payments 
our customers may be adversely affected by an economic downturn  which may subject us to potential credit risks 
in fiscal  we recorded million of bad debt expense attributable to receivables due from adelphia and worldcom 
adelphia and worldcom both filed for bankruptcy protection during fiscal if any of our significant customers file for bankruptcy or experience financial difficulties  we could experience difficulty in collecting what we are owed by them for work already performed or in process  which could lead to reduced cash flows and a decline in our liquidity 
additionally  we may incur losses in excess of current allowances provided 
we self insure against certain potential liabilities  which leaves us potentially exposed to higher than expected liability claims 
we retain the risk  up to certain limits  for automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation  locate damage claims  and employee group health claims 
we estimate and develop our accrual for claims in future periods based on facts  circumstances and historical evidence 
however  the calculation of the estimated accrued liability for self insured claims remains subject to inherent uncertainty 
should a greater number of claims occur compared to what we have estimated  or should the dollar amount of actual claims exceed what we anticipated  our recorded reserves may not be sufficient  and we could incur substantial additional unanticipated charges 
see critical accounting policies self insured claims liability 

table of contents the loss of certain key managers could adversely affect our business 
we depend on the performance of our executive officers and the senior management of our subsidiaries 
our senior management team has numerous years of experience in our industry  and the loss of any of them could negatively affect our ability to execute our business strategy 
although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers and certain other key employees  we cannot guarantee that any key management personnel will remain with us for any length of time 
the loss of key management could adversely affect the management of our operations 
we do not carry significant key person life insurance on any of our employees 
our results of operations may fluctuate seasonally 
most of our work is performed outdoors and as a result  our results of operations are impacted by extended periods of inclement weather 
generally  inclement weather occurs during the winter season which falls during our second and third quarters of the fiscal year 
in addition  a disproportionate percentage of total holidays fall within our second quarter  which impacts the number of available workdays 
as a result  we may experience reduced revenues in the second and third quarters of each year 
if we fail to integrate future acquisitions successfully  this could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
as part of our growth strategy  we may acquire companies that expand  complement  or diversify our business 
we regularly review various opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding such possible acquisitions 
future acquisitions may expose us to operational challenges and risks  including the diversion of management s attention from our existing business  the failure to retain key personnel or customers of an acquired business  the assumption of unknown liabilities of the acquired business for which there are inadequate reserves and the potential impairment of acquired intangible assets 
our ability to sustain our growth and maintain our competitive position may be affected by our ability to successfully integrate any businesses acquired 
our backlog is subject to reduction and or cancellation 
our backlog is comprised of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under job specific contracts and the estimated value of future services that we expect to provide under long term requirements contracts  including master service agreements 
in many instances our customers are not contractually committed to specific volumes of services under a contract

consequently  these programs have generally been subject to more uncertainty  as compared to those of our other customers  with regards to budgets and activity levels 
our estimates of a customer s requirements during a particular future period may not be accurate at any point in time 
if our estimated backlog is significantly inaccurate or does not result in future profits  this could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
we may incur impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we conduct on at least an annual basis a review of our reporting units to determine whether the carrying value of their respective assets exceeds their corresponding fair market value 
should this be the case  we would determine that the value of our goodwill is impaired and such goodwill would be written down 
any such write down could adversely affect our results of operations 
during  as the result of our annual impairment analysis  we recognized a non cash after tax charge of approximately million in order to reduce the carrying value of goodwill related to our white mountain cable construction subsidiary 
we may incur future impairment if our operating results deteriorate for reasons such as those described under risk factors in this annual report 
unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income and other tax liabilities could affect our profitability 
we are subject to income taxes in many different jurisdictions of the united states and our tax liabilities are subject to the apportionment of income in different jurisdictions 
our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in locations with differing tax rates  in the 
table of contents valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or in tax laws or by material audit assessments  which could affect our profitability 
in particular  the carrying value of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income 
in addition  the amount of income and other taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions  and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 
many of our telecommunications customers are highly regulated and the addition of new regulations or changes to existing regulations may adversely impact their demand for our specialty contracting services and the profitability of those services 
many of our telecommunications customers are regulated by the fcc 
the fcc may interpret the application of its regulations to telecommunication companies in a manner that is different than the way such regulations are currently interpreted and may impose additional regulations 
if existing or new regulations have an adverse affect on our telecommunications customers and adversely impact the profitability of the services they provide  then demand for our specialty contracting services may be reduced 
our operations expose us to various safety and environmental regulations 
we are required to comply with increasingly stringent laws and regulations governing environmental protection and workplace safety 
with respect to safety  our workers frequently operate heavy machinery and  as such  they are subject to potential injury to themselves or others in the vicinity of work being performed 
if any of our workers or any other persons are injured or killed in the course of our operations  we could be found to have violated relevant safety regulations  which could result in a fine or  in extreme cases  criminal sanction 
a significant portion of our operations result in work performed underground 
as a result  we are potentially subject to material liabilities related to encountering underground objects which may cause the release hazardous materials or substances 
the environmental laws and regulations which may relate to our business include those regarding the removal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste 
these laws and regulations can impose significant fines and criminal sanctions for violations 
costs associated with the discharge of hazardous materials or substances may include clean up costs and related damages or liabilities 
these costs could be significant and could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see note  summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of new accounting pronouncements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we considered the provision of financial reporting release no 
disclosure of accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments  and disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information about market risk inherent in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments in determining our market risk 
we had no significant holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at july  a review of our other financial instruments and risk exposures at that date revealed that we had exposure to interest rate risk 
at july   we performed sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect of this risk and concluded that a hypothetical change in interest rates of basis points would not materially affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
