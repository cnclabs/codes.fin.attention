overview the company continued its trend of strong earnings growth during the year ended december   primarily resulting from double digit loan growth and good asset quality 
net income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for  an increase of 
diluted earnings per share increased in to per share  compared to in return on assets roa was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december   while return on average equity roe was for  compared to for the bank s net interest margin was during the year ended december  compared to during the year ended december  yields on earning assets continued to adjust down during the year  but had leveled off by year end as a result of several rounds of interest rate tightening by the federal reserve late in the bank s cost of interest bearing liabilities experienced similar declines during  but also began to flatten by year end 
the company s efficiency ratio was for the year compared to for non interest expenses increased to million from million during this increase reflects additional costs associated with opening a new facility that combined operations and corporate offices  upgrading the company s computer systems which included new hardware  software  and additional security protection and growing the company s ancillary service offerings by expanding its investment subsidiary  shore investments inc  through the addition of a certified financial planner in the company s maryland market and by starting a mortgage banking division within the bank dedicated to originating and selling conforming fixed rate loan products 
spearheaded by a growth in gross loans  total assets grew to million at december   an increase of over the million at december  total gross loans ended the year at million  compared to million at december   while total deposits ended the year at million  compared million at december  the bank s commercial loan portfolio experienced the largest percentage growth during the year with an increase of since december  while mortgage loans including construction loans also experienced double digit growth with an increase of 
on the deposit side  noninterest bearing deposits represented the largest percentage growth at since december  while lower costing interest bearing transaction accounts increased during the period 
total shareholders equity grew to million at december   an increase over the million in equity at december  during  the quality of the bank s loan portfolio continued to be strong 
the bank experienced net loan charge offs of  during at a rate of of total loans  while the level of nonperforming assets to period end loans was at december  the bank had no other real estate owned oreo or other foreclosed assets at december  the bank maintained an allowance for loan losses to period end loans of at the end of results of operation general net interest income is the major component of the company s earnings and is equal to the amount by which interest income exceeds interest expense 
interest income is derived from interest earning assets composed primarily of loans and securities 
interest expense results from interest bearing liabilities  primarily consisting of deposits and short term borrowings 
changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities  as well as changes in the yields earned and rates paid  determine changes in net interest income 
net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average earning assets and represents the company s net yield on its earning assets 
interest income compared to during the year ended december   the company earned million in interest income  compared to the million earned for the year ended december  the company overcame declining portfolio loan rates by growing loans during the year  resulting in the increase in interest income 
additionally  the company increased its loan to deposit ratio from in to in  thus improving the mix of interest earning assets 
securities yielded during the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  average securities declined by million to million during compared to million during this decrease resulted from the heavy loan demand experienced during the year absorbing most excess liquidity and the fewer investment opportunities that existed 
loans yielded during the year ended december   compared to during average total loans increased million  or  to million during from million during the bank s average commercial loan portfolio experienced the largest percentage growth during the year with an increase of since december  while average mortgage loans including construction loans also experienced double digit growth with an increase of 
average consumer loans including home equity lines were million for the year ended december   an increase of over the million average outstanding during the year ended december  a vibrant loan market  driven by low interest rates and a strong real estate market  and seasoned loan producers significantly contributed to the loan growth success of compared to during the year ended december   the company earned million in interest income  as compared to the million earned for the year ended december  while the low interest rate policy maintained by the federal reserve during continued to impact net interest income  the company was able to realize an increase in this area by growing total loans 
additionally  the company was successful in redeploying a significant portion of the million in funds received through its deposit acquisition from investment securities to loans 
consequently  average loans outstanding increased million  while average investment securities only increased million 
securities yielded during the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  average securities increased to million during  compared to an average balance of million for the period 
as a result of the december deposit acquisition  the company began with million in investment securities 
however  loan demand and flat deposit levels resulted in a net decrease in investment securities during the year 
loans yielded during the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  average total loans increased to million during from million for the period 
the bank experienced significant growth in several areas of its loan portfolio during  with double digit increases in commercial loans  residential real estate loans  construction loans and home equity lines of credit during the year 
average commercial loans increased to million  an increase of over the million average outstanding balance during on the retail side  average residential real estate loans including construction loans increased to million  or over the million average outstanding for  while average consumer loans including home equity lines were million for the year ended december   an increase of over the million average outstanding during the year ended december  more seasoned loan producers and a ripe lending environment significantly contributed to the loan growth success of interest expense compared to even with double digit growth in deposits  interest expense was flat at million during the year ended december   as compared to average interest bearing liabilities increased to million during the year ended december   as compared to million during  while the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points from during to during total average deposits  including noninterest bearing demand deposits  increased to million during the year ended december  from million during the company s cost of funds including demand deposits was during  compared to for the year ended december  several factors contributed to interest expense remaining flat in spite of increased volumes  primarily related to the growth mix that occurred during the year 
average checking and savings account balances increased million during and the cost of these funds for the year was basis points  representing only a basis point increase over the prior year 
average time deposit balances increased million  but the cost of these deposits decreased basis points to for the year 
the dependence on time deposit funding continued to decline with average time deposits representing of average funding liabilities during compared to during also benefiting the company s cost of funds is the continued growth in demand deposits 
during  average demand deposits grew million or over balances  representing a significant pool of noninterest bearing deposits to fund asset growth 
the bank also placed a heavier reliance on federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings during with the average balance increasing by million 
however  the increase in overnight rates that occurred during caused the cost of these borrowings to increase by basis points to during the year 
compared to interest expense continued to ride the rate curve down during interest expense was million during the year ended december   a decrease of as compared to million for average interest bearing liabilities increased to million during from million for the prior year  while the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points from during to during total average deposits  including noninterest bearing demand deposits  increased to million during the year ended december  from million during factoring in noninterest bearing demand deposits  the company s cost of funds was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
also contributing to lower funding costs was an increase in short term fhlb borrowings 
average fhlb borrowings increased to million during  compared to million for  while the average cost of these funds decreased from to for the periods 
although funding costs continued to benefit from the lower interest rate environment during the period  it also benefited from a change in the company s funding mix 
during  average time deposits represented of average funding liabilities  while it only represented of average funding liabilities during net interest income compared to the company continued to improve its net interest margin during helped by strong loan demand and rising rates during the second half of the year  the company s net interest margin increased from during to during as illustrated by the its interest sensitivity analysis  the company remains asset sensitive  an advantageous position during a period of rising rates like we have experienced since june these factors  in conjunction with the continued improvement in the bank s funding mix  contributed to net interest income increasing to million during the year ended december  as compared to million in compared to the company entered coming off a deposit acquisition that created the need to effectively invest million in acquired deposits into income producing assets 
as a result  the company began with a net interest margin of  posing quite a challenge for the year 
however  the deployment of these funds into higher yielding loan assets and the management of deposit mix enabled the company to increase its margin to during the fourth quarter of and for the year 
these factors  along with loan growth and changes in the funding mix  contributed to net interest income increasing to million during the year ended december  as compared to million in the following tables illustrate average balances of total interest earning assets and total interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated  showing the average distribution of assets  liabilities  stockholders equity and the related income  expense  and corresponding weighted average yields and costs

the tax equivalent adjustment to net interest income was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest rate spread is the average yield earned on earning assets less the average rate incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is derived by dividing net interest income by average total earning assets 
the following table describes the impact on the interest income of the company resulting from changes in average balances and average rates for the periods indicated

using this model  management determines the overall magnitude of interest sensitivity risk and then formulates policies governing asset generation and pricing  funding sources and pricing  and off balance sheet commitments in order to reduce sensitivity risk 
these decisions are based on management s outlook regarding future interest rate movements  the state of the local and national economy  and other financial and business risk factors 
an important element of the company s asset liability management process is monitoring its interest sensitivity gap 
the interest sensitivity gap is the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities at a specific time interval 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities  and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets during a given period 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap within shorter maturities would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap within shorter maturities would result in an increase in net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap within shorter maturities would result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap within shorter maturities would have the opposite effect 
this gap can be managed by repricing assets or liabilities  by selling investments available for sale  by replacing an asset or liability at maturity  or by adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability 
matching the amounts of assets and liabilities maturing in the same time interval helps to hedge the risk and minimize the impact on net interest income in periods of rising or falling interest rates

management has determined that interest checking and savings accounts  excluding  in savings accounts with more frequent rate adjustment terms  are not sensitive to changes in related market rates and  therefore  they are placed in the to years and over years categories  respectively 
all securities without specific maturities are included in the to years category since they are not considered as sensitive to interest rate changes 
noninterest income compared to during the year ended december   noninterest income increased to million from million in excluding gains on sales of securities of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  noninterest income increased to million during  as compared to million for the year end period 
a increase in deposit account fees generated from strong consumer and commercial deposit growth represented the primary factor driving noninterest income growth during the year 
these accounts generate fees including insufficient funds  check printing  cashiers checks  service charges  atm  check cards and others  several of which experienced double digit growth during these fees are core earnings that are not interest sensitive and have provided a stable source of income for the bank 
additionally  the company took steps to expand its ancillary service offerings and improve its noninterest income by expanding its investment subsidiary  shore investments inc  through the addition of a certified financial planner in the company s maryland market and by starting a mortgage banking division within the bank dedicated to originating and selling conforming fixed rate loan products

securities when securities are purchased  they are classified as securities held to maturity if management has the positive intent and the company has the ability to hold them until maturity 
these investment securities are carried at cost adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discounts 
unrealized losses in the portfolio are not recognized unless management of the company believes that other than a temporary decline has occurred 
securities held for indefinite periods of time and not intended to be held to maturity are classified as available for sale at the time of purchase 
securities available for sale are recorded at fair value 
the net unrealized holding gain or loss on securities available for sale  net of deferred income taxes  is included in other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity 
a decline in the fair value of any securities available for sale below cost  that is deemed other than temporary  is charged to earnings and results in a new cost basis for the security

the adequacy of the company s capital is reviewed by management on an ongoing basis with reference to the size  composition  and quality of the company s resources and consistent with regulatory requirements and industry standards 
management seeks to maintain a capital structure that will support anticipated asset growth and absorb potential losses 
banking regulations established to ensure capital adequacy require the company and the bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier i capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined  and of tier i capital to average assets as defined

asset quality allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents an amount management believes is adequate to provide for probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management evaluates the allowance for loan losses on a regular basis using a methodology that considers various risk factors in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
this methodology includes analyzing historical loan losses  current trends in delinquencies and charge offs  the opinions of our regulators  changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio and industry data 
however  risks of future losses cannot be quantified precisely or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
because those risks are influenced by general economic trends as well as conditions affecting individual borrowers  management s judgment of the allowance is necessarily approximate and imprecise 
the allowance is also subject to regulatory examinations and determinations as to adequacy  which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance in comparison to peer banks identified by regulatory agencies 
set forth below is a table detailing the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated 
allowance for loan losses years ended december  in thousands balance  beginning of period loans charged off commercial real estate mortgage consumer total loans charged off recoveries commercial real estate mortgage consumer total recoveries net recoveries charge offs provision for loan losses balance  end of period allowance for loan losses to loans outstanding at end of period allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans outstanding at end of period net charge offs recoveries to average loans outstanding during period as in recent years  the bank s charge offs during continued to be minimal 
with the exception of  charge offs have primarily occurred in the consumer loan category over the past five years 
during  the bank experienced a  charge off relating to the insufficient collateral on two loans foreclosed on during the year 
during  the bank obtained possession of additional property owned by this borrower 
during  the bank sold the property at foreclosure  but the borrower subsequently filed for bankruptcy so the sale is not final 
final resolution should result in substantial recovery of the deficiency 
the bank s loan portfolio continues to evolve from primarily residential real estate mortgages to one with a significant emphasis in commercial and consumer loans 
increased competition in the real estate mortgage arena and the desire to diversify contributed to this shift in lending and customer relationships 
however  with this change comes increased risk associated with potential loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of period end loans has been between and over the past five years  while the ratio of the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans outstanding has ranged from to 
based on these factors  management believes that allowances for losses existing at december  are sufficient to cover any anticipated or unanticipated losses on loans outstanding in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
an allocation of the allowance for loan losses in dollars and as a percent of the total allowance is provided in the following tables 
because all of these factors are subject to change  the allocation is not necessarily predictive of future loan losses in the indicated categories 
allocation of allowance for loan losses commercial real estate consumer allowance for loan losses percentage of loan allowance allowance for loan losses percentage of loan allowance allowance for loan losses percentage of loan allowance in thousands december  the following table details information concerning nonaccrual and past due loans  as well as foreclosed assets

the bank s policy is that whenever a loan reaches days delinquent interest accruals are suspended until six months after the loan becomes current again 
in recent years  the bank has experienced strong asset quality in its loan portfolio 
low interest rates and an exuberant real estate market have created a vibrant lending environment and provided borrowers the opportunity to finance larger purchases at lower costs 
accordingly  trends in total nonperforming assets and the related ratios have been relatively positive for the periods presented 
at december   there were no loans identified by the bank as impaired under the established accounting guidelines 
accordingly  no specific allowances were provided with respect to impaired loans at december  included in nonaccrual loans at december  and is one impaired loan to the same borrower with a balance of  and  respectively 
the balance was partially paid and brought current during however  the borrower was unable to meet the remaining obligation and  consequently  filed for bankruptcy protection 
the bank entered into an agreement with the bankruptcy trustee to sell the collateral during the first quarter of proceeds from these sales were sufficient to satisfy all principal and interest amounts due 
at december   there were no loans identified by the bank as impaired under the established accounting guidelines  as compared to december  when there were loans totaling  identified by the bank as impaired 
amounts identified at december  were to the same borrower and the bank foreclosed on assets collateralizing these loans during upon foreclosure  the bank wrote the assets down by  in conjunction with the methodology described above to calculate the allowance for loan losses  the bank closely monitors individual loans that are deemed to be potential problem loans 
loans are viewed as potential problem loans when possible credit problems of borrowers or industry trends cause management to have doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with current repayment terms 
those loans are subject to regular management attention  and their status is reviewed on a regular basis 
in instances where management determines that a specific allowance should be set  the bank takes such action as deemed appropriate 
as of december   all loans days or more delinquent  including nonperforming loans  totaled million 
additionally  other performing loans totaling million existed that were current  but had other potential weaknesses that management considers to warrant additional monitoring 
all loans in these categories are subject to constant management attention  and their status is reviewed on a regular basis 
these loans are generally secured by residential and commercial real estate and equipment with appraised values that exceed the remaining principal balances on such loans 
liquidity  asset management liquidity represents the company s ability to meet present and future obligations through the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management 
liquid assets include cash  interest bearing deposits with banks  federal funds sold  investments maturing within one year  and investments that are categorized as available for sale 
the company s ability to obtain deposits and purchase funds at favorable rates impacts its liability liquidity 
as a result of the company s management of liquid assets and the ability to generate liquidity through liability funding  management believes that the company maintains overall liquidity that is sufficient to satisfy its depositor s requirements and meet its customers credit needs 
the table below summarizes the company s balance sheet liquidity position for the periods presented 
additionally  alternative sources of liquidity are available to the company including its capacity to borrow additional funds when the need arises 
the bank has an available line of credit with the fhlb for up to of bank assets  or approximately million at december  however  the bank may request an increase in this borrowing capacity from the fhlb 
at december  the bank had sufficient collateral pledged to borrow a total of approximately million from the fhlb 
the borrowing capacity is subject to certain collateral requirements as stipulated in the fhlb borrowing agreement

management determines loan loss estimates by analyzing historical loan losses  current trends in delinquencies and charge offs  the opinions of our regulators  changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio and industry data 
additionally  we consider the impact of economic events  the outcome of which is uncertain 
while we use the best information available in establishing the allowance  actual economic conditions differing significantly from our assumptions in determining the loan loss valuation allowance may result in future adjustments  or regulators may require adjustments based upon information available to them at the time of their examinations 
although we believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate and properly recorded in our financial statements  differing economic conditions or alternate methods of estimation could result in materially different amounts of loan losses 
the estimation of fair value is significant to several of our assets  including available for sale afs investment securities and real estate owned reo 
afs securities are recorded at fair value  while reo is generally recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated selling costs 
fair values can be volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  discount rates and market conditions  among others 
since these factors can change significantly and rapidly  fair values are difficult to predict and are subject to material changes  which could impact our financial condition 
impact of accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued a revision of fasb interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities  and interpretation of arb no 
fin 
fin provides a new framework for identifying variable interest entities vies and determining when a company should include the assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests and results of activities of a vie in its consolidated financial statements 
fasb has since revised fin as revised  fin was effective beginning in the first quarter of for all vies other than what are commonly referred to as special purpose entities  vies of small business issuers  and vies of nonpublic entities 
as the company does not currently utilize vies or so called special purpose entities  this pronouncement did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r during december sfas r requires that compensation cost relating to stockbased payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the instruments issued 
public entities other than those filing as small business issuers are required to apply sfas r as of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  the scope of sfas r includes stock options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
sfas r replaces sfas and supersedes apb sfas  originally issued in  preferred the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation  but permitted the continued application of the guidance in opinion  provided that the footnotes to the financial statements disclosed what net income would have been had the preferable fair value based method been used 
during december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas 
sfas amends apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  originally issued in the standard is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
previously  opinion required that the accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive asset should be based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished 
the provisions in sfas are effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  early application is permitted and companies must apply the standard prospectively 
the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the bank s consolidated results of operations or financial condition in the foreseeable future 
effects of inflation the company believes that its net interest income and results of operations have not been significantly affected by inflation during the years ended december   and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company uses a third party provider to perform computer modeling methodologies that assist in determining the overall magnitude of interest sensitivity risk 
based on these methodologies  management formulates policies governing asset generation and pricing  funding sources and pricing  and off balance sheet commitments in order to reduce sensitivity risk 
these decisions are based on management s outlook regarding future interest rate movements  the state of the local and national economy  and other financial and business risk factors 
the modeling methodologies used measure interest rate sensitivity by analyzing the potential impact on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
normally  one such scenario would assume a hypothetical basis point instantaneous and parallel shift in the yield curve in interest rates 
however  management adjusted this scenario during to account for the relatively low interest rates existing during the period caused the likelihood of a basis point instantaneous and parallel decline in interest rates decline to be remote 
accordingly  management modeled the impact of a basis point decline in interest rates and a basis point increase in interest rates at december  a basis point instantaneous and parallel decrease in the yield curve in interest rates would cause net interest income to decrease by  while a basis point instantaneous and parallel increase in the yield curve in interest rates would cause net interest income to increase by  the computer model uses standard algebraic formula for calculating present value 
the calculation discounts the future cash flows of the company s portfolio of interest rate sensitive instruments to present value utilizing techniques designed to approximate current market rates for securities  current offering rates for loans  and the cost of alternative funding for the given maturity of deposits and then assumes an instantaneous and parallel shift in these rates 
the difference between these numbers represents the resulting hypothetical change in the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments 
as with any modeling techniques  certain limitations and shortcomings are inherent in the company s methodology 
significant assumptions must be made in the calculation including no growth in volume or balance sheet mix  constant market interest rates reflecting the average rate from the last month of the given quarter  and pricing spreads to market rates derived from an historical analysis  or from assumptions by instrument type 
additionally  the computations do not contemplate certain actions management could undertake in response to changes in interest rates
