item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of atlantic american corporation atlantic american or the parent and its subsidiaries collectively  the company for each of the three years in the period ended december  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
atlantic american is an insurance holding company whose operations are conducted through a group of regional insurance companies american southern insurance company and american safety insurance company together known as american southern  association casualty insurance company and association risk management general agency  inc together known as association casualty  georgia casualty surety company georgia casualty  and bankers fidelity life insurance company bankers fidelity 
each operating company is managed separately based upon the geographic location or the type of products offered  although management is conforming information systems  policies and procedures  products  marketing and other functions between association casualty and georgia casualty to create a southern regional property and casualty operation and increase efficiencies 
critical accounting estimates the accounting and reporting policies of atlantic american and its subsidiaries are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and  in management s belief  conform to general practices within the insurance industry 
the following is an explanation of the company s accounting policies and the resultant estimates considered most significant by management 
these accounting policies inherently require significant judgment and assumptions and actual results could differ from management s initial estimates 
atlantic american does not expect that changes in the estimates determined using these policies would have a material effect on the company s financial condition or liquidity  although changes could have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations 
unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense comprised of the company s liabilities at december  this obligation includes estimates for unpaid losses on claims reported prior to december   future development on those reported claims  unpaid ultimate losses on claims incurred prior to december  but not yet reported to the company and unpaid loss adjustment expenses for reported and unreported claims incurred prior to december  quantification of loss estimates for each of these components involves a significant degree of judgment and estimates may vary  materially  from period to period 
estimated unpaid losses on reported claims are developed based on historical experience with similar claims by the company 
future development on reported claims  estimates of unpaid ultimate losses on claims incurred prior to december  but not yet reported to the company  and estimates of unpaid loss adjustment expenses are developed based on the company s historical experience  using actuarial methods to assist in the analysis 
the company s actuarial staff develops ranges of estimated future development on reported and unreported claims as well as loss adjustment expenses using various methods including the paid loss development method  the reported loss development method  the paid bornhuetter ferguson method  the reported bornhuetter ferguson method  the berquist sherman method and a frequency severity method 
any single method used to estimate ultimate losses has inherent advantages and disadvantages due to the trends and changes affecting the business environment and the company s administrative policies 
further  a variety of external factors  such as legislative changes  medical inflation  and others may directly or indirectly impact the relative adequacy of liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the company s approach is the selection of an estimate of ultimate losses based on comparing results of a variety of reserving methods  as opposed to total reliance on any single method 
unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses are reviewed periodically for significant lines of business  and when current results differ from the original assumptions used to develop such estimates  the amount of the company s recorded liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is adjusted 
in the event the company s actual reported losses in any period are 
table of contents materially in excess of the previous estimated amounts  such losses  to the extent reinsurance coverage does not exist  would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
future policy benefits comprised of the company s total liabilities at december  these liabilities relate to life insurance products and are based upon assumed future investment yields  mortality rates  and withdrawal rates after giving effect to possible risks of adverse deviation 
the assumed mortality and withdrawal rates are based upon the company s experience 
if actual results differ from the initial assumptions  the amount of the company s recorded liability could require adjustment 
deferred acquisition costs comprised of the company s total assets at december  deferred acquisition costs are commissions  premium taxes  and other costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal business and are generally deferred and amortized 
the deferred amounts are recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and amortized to income in a systematic manner 
traditional life insurance and long duration health insurance deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated premium paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in computing the related liability for policy benefit reserves 
the deferred acquisition costs for property and casualty insurance and short duration health insurance are amortized over the effective period of the related insurance policies 
deferred policy acquisition costs are expensed when such costs are deemed not to be recoverable from future premiums for traditional life and long duration health insurance and from the related unearned premiums and investment income for property and casualty and short duration health insurance 
assessments of recoverability for property and casualty and short duration health insurance are extremely sensitive to the estimates of a subsequent year s projected losses related to the unearned premiums 
projected loss estimates for a current block of business for which unearned premiums remain to be earned may vary significantly from the indicated losses incurred in any given previous calendar year 
receivables are amounts due from reinsurers  insureds and agents and comprised of the company s total assets at december  allowances for uncollectible amounts are established  as and when a loss has been determined probable  against the related receivable 
annually  the company using various data sources performs an analysis of the credit worthiness of the company s reinsurers 
failure of reinsurers to meet their obligations due to insolvencies or disputes could result in uncollectible amounts and losses to the company 
insured and agent balances are evaluated periodically for collectibility 
losses are recognized when determined on a specific account basis and a general provision for loss is made based on the company s historical experience 
cash and investments comprised of the company s total assets at december  substantially all investments are in bonds and common and preferred stocks  which are subject to significant market fluctuations 
the company carries all investments as available for sale and accordingly at their estimated fair values 
the company owns certain non redeemable preferred stocks that do not have quoted values and are carried at estimated fair values as determined by management 
such values inherently have a greater degree of judgement and uncertainty and therefore ultimately greater price volatility 
on occasion  the value of an investment may decline to a value below its amortized purchase price and remain at such value for an extended period of time 
when an investment s indicated fair value has declined below its cost basis for a period of time  primarily due to changes in credit risk  the company evaluates such investment for other than a temporary impairment 
if other than a temporary impairment is deemed to exist  then the company will write down the amortized cost basis of the investment to its estimated fair value 
while such write down does not impact the reported value of the investment in the company s balance sheet  it is reflected as a realized investment loss in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
deferred income taxes comprised less than of the company s total assets at december  deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for tax purposes 
these deferred income taxes are measured by applying currently enacted tax laws and rates 
valuation allowances are recognized to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized

the decrease in net income was partially offset by a million deferred tax benefit related to a reduction of the company s valuation allowance compared to a similar million and million deferred tax benefit in and  respectively

since losing that significant contract  american southern has been successful in replacing the lost business with new accounts from a more diversified group of clients by underwriting several new programs  specifically in the general liability and surety lines of business 
in addition  american southern has generated new business and premium growth through new agency appointments and established agents 

table of contents ceded premiums increased million  or  during as compared to as american southern s premiums are determined and ceded as a percentage of earned premiums  an increase in ceded premiums occurs when earned premiums increase 
in  american southern also experienced an increase in reinsurance rates of approximately that resulted in a higher effective rate of premiums ceded as compared to due to increases in the volume of american southern s general liability business 
gross written premiums at american southern decreased million  or  during as compared to the decrease in premiums was attributable to the loss of american southern s largest account  partially offset by new business opportunities 
ceded premiums decreased million  or  during as compared to although american southern experienced an increase in reinsurance rates in  the effective percent of premiums ceded to premiums earned remained virtually unchanged in from rate increases were offset by a reduction in reinsurance costs attributable to the loss of american southern s largest account discussed previously 
this contract had higher reinsurance costs than the other accounts in american southern s book of business 
american southern produces much of its business through contracts with various states and municipalities  some of which represent significant amounts of revenue 
these contracts  which last from one to three years  are periodically subject to competitive renewal quotes and the loss of a significant contract could have a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of american southern and the company 
in an effort to increase the number of programs underwritten by american southern and to insulate it from the loss of any one program  american southern is continually evaluating new underwriting programs 
there can be no assurance  however  that new programs or new accounts will offset lost business resulting from the non renewal of any one or more contracts in the future 
further  profit margins on contracts vary significantly and new business opportunities may not be as profitable as non renewed contracts 
the following table summarizes  for the periods indicated  american southern s earned premiums by line of business year ended december  in thousands automobile liability automobile physical damage general liability property surety total earned premium net earned premiums for increased million  or  over the increase during reflects increased earned premiums from new business written in the fourth quarter of and continuing in american southern increased its business writings in the general liability and surety lines of business beginning in the second half of and  as indicated in the table above  such trends continued in net earned premiums for decreased million  or  from primarily due to the loss of american southern s largest contract  partially offset by the new  more diversified business written in the performance of an insurance company is often measured by the combined ratio 
the combined ratio represents the percentage of losses  loss adjustment expenses and other expenses that are incurred for each dollar of premium earned by the company 
a combined ratio of under represents an underwriting profit while a combined ratio of over indicates an underwriting loss 
the combined ratio 
table of contents is divided into two components  the loss ratio the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned and the expense ratio the ratio of expenses incurred to premiums earned 
the combined ratio for american southern increased to in from a combined ratio of in the loss ratio decreased to in from in the decrease in the loss ratio during was primarily attributable to changes in american southern s book of business 
the increased focus on new business writings in general liability and surety that began in the second half of resulted in a decrease in the loss ratio due to favorable loss experience in those lines of business during the hurricane related losses in the state of florida  which contributed million to the hurricane related expenses within the property and casualty operations partially offset the reported improvement in the loss ratio 
the expense ratio for increased to from in the increase in the expense ratio for is a function of american southern s contractual arrangements  which compensate the company s agents in relation to the loss ratios of the business they write 
the majority of american southern s business is structured in such a way that the agents are rewarded or penalized based upon the loss ratio of the business they submit 
by structuring its business in this manner  american southern provides its agents with an economic incentive to place profitable business with american southern 
as a result of this arrangement  in periods where losses and the loss ratio decrease  commission and underwriting expenses increase

ceded premiums at association casualty increased million  or  during from in  association casualty s primary reinsurance agreement expired 
due to the proposed renewal rates and terms associated therewith  association casualty terminated the relationship with its then existing reinsurer and entered into a new reinsurance agreement

the combined ratio for association casualty decreased to in from in the loss ratio decreased to in from in the decrease in the loss ratio was primarily due to the re underwriting of its workers compensation book of business 
although association casualty benefited from the re underwriting of its workers compensation business  it continued to be adversely impacted by the liberal interpretation of the workers compensation laws in the state of texas

such accruals were not necessary during the same period of these increases in ceded premiums were partially offset by the cession rate decrease in the quota share agreement 
during  georgia casualty operated pursuant to a quota share reinsurance agreement with association casualty

represents balances due for goods and or services which have been contractually committed as of december  to the extent contracts provide for early termination with notice but without penalty  only the amounts contractually due during the notice period have been included 
losses and claims include case reserves for reported claims and reserves for claims incurred but not reported ibnr 
while payments due on claim reserves are considered contractual obligations because they relate to insurance policies issued by the company  the ultimate amount to be paid to settle both case reserves and ibnr is an estimate  subject to significant uncertainty 
the actual amount to be paid is not determined until the company reaches a settlement with any applicable claimant 
final claim settlements may vary significantly from the present estimates  particularly since many claims will not be settled until well into the future 
in estimating the timing of future payments by year  the company has assumed that its historical payment patterns will continue 
however  the actual timing of future payments will likely vary materially from these estimates due to  among other things  changes in claim reporting and payment patterns and large unanticipated settlements 
amounts reflected do not consider reinsurance amounts which may also be recoverable based on the level of ultimate sustained loss 
future policy benefits relate to life insurance policies on which the company is not currently making payments and will not make future payments until the occurrence of an insurable event  such as a death or disability  or the occurrence of a payment triggering event  such as a surrender of a policy 
occurrence of any of these events is outside the control of the company and the payment estimates are based on significant uncertainties such as mortality  morbidity  expenses  persistency  investment returns  inflation and the timing of payments 
for regulatory purposes  the company does perform cash flow modeling of such liabilities  which is the basis for the indicated disclosure  however  due to the significance of the assumptions used  the amount presented could materially differ from actual results 
unearned premiums represent future revenue for the company  however  under certain circumstances  such premiums may be refundable with cancellation of the underlying policy 
significantly all unearned premium will be earned within the following twelve month period as the related future insurance protection is provided 
significantly all costs related to such unearned premiums have 
table of contents already been incurred and paid and are included in deferred acquisition costs  however  future losses related to the unearned premium have not been recorded 
the contractual obligations related to unearned premium reflected in the table represent the average loss ratio applied to the year end unearned premium balances  with loss payments projected in comparable proportions to the year end loss and claims reserves 
projecting future losses is subject to significant uncertainties and the projected payments will most likely vary materially from these estimates as a result of differences in future severity  frequency and other anticipated and unanticipated factors 
amounts reflected do not take into account reinsurance amounts which may be recoverable based on the level of ultimate sustained loss
