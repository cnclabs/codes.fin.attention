item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about the company and its bank subsidiary s financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from the financial statements included in this annual report 
reference should be made to those statements and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report for an understanding of the following discussion and analysis 
forward looking statements statements contained in this portion of the company s annual report may be forward looking statements  as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements may be identified by the use of such words as intend  believe  expect  anticipate  should  planned  estimated  and potential 
such forward looking statements are based on current expectations  but may differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors  which include  but are not limited to  factors discussed in documents filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission from time to time 
other factors which could have a material adverse effect on the operations of the company and its subsidiaries which include  but are not limited to  changes in interest rates  general economic conditions  legislative and regulatory changes  monetary and fiscal policies of the us government  including policies of the us treasury and the federal reserve board  the quality and composition of the loan or investment portfolios  demand for loan products  deposit flows  competition  demand for financial services in the bank s market area  changes in relevant accounting principles and guidelines and other factors over which management has no control 
the forward looking statements are made as of the date of this report  and the company assumes no obligation to update the forward looking statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in the forward looking statements 
critical accounting policy and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and the company follows general practices within the industries in which it operates 
at times  the application of these principles requires management to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these assumptions  estimates and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different assumptions  estimates and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on assumptions  estimates and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
examples of critical assumptions  estimates and judgments are when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not required to be recorded at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability must be recorded contingent upon a future event 
all significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in the management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued and how those values are determined for the financial statements 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to assumptions  estimates and judgments underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses alll as the accounting area that requires the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be the most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the alll represents management s estimate of credit losses inherent in the bank s loan portfolio at the report date 
the estimate is a composite of a variety of factors including past experience  collateral value  and the general economy 
alll includes a specific portion  a formula driven portion  and a general nonspecific portion 
the collection and ultimate recovery of the book value of the collateral  in most cases  is beyond our control 

table of contents for more information regarding the estimates and calculations used to establish the alll and the value of mortgage servicing rights  please see note to the consolidated financial statements provided herewith 
financial condition the bank the company s only subsidiary functions as a financial intermediary  and as such  its financial condition should be examined in terms of trends in its sources and uses of funds 
the following comparison of average balances indicates how the bank has managed its sources and uses of sources and uses of funds 
comments in this section relate to annual average amounts  not year end amounts 
average balances are the average of the monthly averages sources and uses of funds trends thousands of dollars average balance amount change change average balance amount change change average balance funding uses loans taxable investment securities tax exempt investment securities federal funds sold interest bearing bank balances total uses funding sources demand deposits non interest bearing interest bearing savings deposits time deposits federal funds purchased and other borrowings repurchase agreements other total sources the bank uses its funds primarily to support its lending activities 
in  the bank and consequently  the company  benefited from the robust florida economy driven both by low interest rates and by the rapid population growth 
average loans increased by  or in after increasing by  or in the increase was largely the result of continued emphasis on lending by bank management and continued favorable economic conditions in the local market 
these favorable growth trends impacted the banks earnings discussed later under results of operations 
average taxable bond investments  another use of funds  increased by  or in and are used to provide liquidity for the bank  while tax exempt bond investments decreased by  or and provide enhanced yield due to their special income tax treatment 
the bank s increase in earning assets from to was funded by increased deposits 
the bank sought to grow its loan portfolio in  and to fund this growth  it sought deposits in the local market place 
the lagging stock market and low interest rates combined to make relatively inexpensive deposits available to the bank 
although deposit growth was from all types of deposits  the bank showed the greatest average growth in savings and money market accounts 

table of contents liquidity and interest rate sensitivity management the primary function of asset liability management is to assure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors wanting to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs 
interest rate sensitivity management seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
marketable investment securities  particularly those of shorter maturities  are a principal source of asset liquidity 
securities maturing  amortizing or expected to be called within one year or less amounted to  at december  representing of the investment securities portfolio  an increase from the amount of  this is due to the bank making an effort to shorten its average bond maturity while rates are low 
shortening the maturity of the portfolio will have the effect of not locking in investment rates while rates are low 
the bank moderates its liquidity needs by maintaining short term borrowing lines with several regional banks 
at year end  the bank had lines of credit established with other banking institutions totaling  brokered deposits are deposit instruments  such as certificates of deposit  bank investment contracts and certain municipal investment contracts that are issued through brokers who then offer and or sell these deposit instruments to one or more investors 
the bank does not currently purchase or sell brokered deposits 
maturities of time certificates of deposit and other time deposits of  or more  outstanding at december   are summarized as follows time deposits thousands of dollars months or less over through months over through months over through months over months total interest rate sensitivity varies with different types of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
overnight federal funds  on which rates change daily  and loans  which are tied to the prime rate  differ considerably from long term investment securities and fixed rate loans 
similarly  time deposits over  and money market accounts are much more interest rate sensitive than passbook savings accounts 
the shorter term interest rate sensitivities are key to measuring the interest sensitivity gap  or excess interest sensitive earning assets over interest bearing liabilities 
the following table shows the interest sensitivity gaps for four different time intervals as of december  for the first year  interest sensitive assets exceed liabilities by  over the following two years  liabilities re price faster than assets 
the excess of interest bearing liabilities over interest earning assets for the one to three year period is primarily related to the longer maturities of cd s and now and mma accounts that are regarded as much less rate sensitive 
as of december thousands of dollars over days days years years interest sensitive assets interest sensitive liabilities interest sensitivity gap cumulative gap the primary interest sensitive assets and liabilities in the one year maturity range are loans and time deposits 
trying to minimize this gap while maintaining earnings is a continual challenge in a changing interest rate environment and one of the objectives of the bank s asset liability management strategy 
management has adopted a philosophy of balancing assets and liabilities over a three year period  which it has accomplished 
management 
table of contents feels that the rate rewards of being balanced over a three year period more than offset the risk of being modestly unbalanced over the short term 
capital resources the bank maintains a strong capital base to take advantage of business opportunities while ensuring that it has resources to absorb the risks inherent in the business 
in january  the federal reserve board released new standards for measuring capital adequacy for us banking organizations 
in general  the standards require banks and bank holding companies to maintain capital based on risk adjusted assets so that categories of assets with potentially higher credit risk will require more capital backing than assets with lower risk 
in addition  banks are required to maintain capital to support  on a risk adjusted basis  certain off balance sheet activities such as loan commitments 
the federal reserve board standards classify capital into two tiers  referred to as tier and tier for the bank  tier capital consists of common shareholders equity 
tier capital consists of allowance for loan and lease losses 
all banks must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of tier capital to total assets of 
to be considered adequately capitalized  banks are required to meet a minimum ratio of of qualifying total tier and tier capital to risk adjusted total assets and at least ratio of tier capital to total assets 
the bank had corresponding ratios of and at year end 
capital that qualifies as tier capital is limited to of tier capital 
the table below illustrates the bank s regulatory capital ratios at december thousands of dollars tier capital tier capital total qualifying capital risk adjusted total assets including off balance exposures average total assets for leverage purposes tier risk based capital ratio total risk based capital ratio leverage ratio at december   there were no commitments for expenditures that would impact the capital of the bank or the company 
relationship between significant financial ratios the following table illustrates this relationship where the percent return on equity times the percent of earnings retained equals the internal capital growth percentage return on average equity earnings retained internal capital growth from a level of in  the rate of internal capital growth has increased to in  in and in this increased growth rate is directly related to the increasing profitability of the bank 
to maintain adequate capital  the bank and the company will continue their efforts to maintain its level of earnings and will give appropriate consideration to capital needs for expansion and growth before determining annual dividend pay out to the company or to shareholders 

table of contents results of operations the company s net income for was  an increase of from earnings of  and up from earnings of  on a per share basis  net income for the similar periods were  
and 
after retroactively adjusting for annual stock dividends and a three for two split in despite continued low rates causing the banks rate margin to narrow slightly in  the bank s net interest income grew as a result of the growth in loans and deposits resulting from the robust local economy 
income improved significantly from to  despite the growth in overhead due to growth of the company and the acquisition of the trust company of florida 
in income was impacted by low interest rates and the proliferation of refinancing in the real estate markets 
the overhead associated with the replacement of refinanced loans and with the growth of the bank impacted the bank s net profits 
however  many of these expenses are non recurring and the overhead associated with the loan portfolio returned to more normal levels in in addition  average loans outstanding increased significantly in as a result  net interest income after loan loss reserve  was up by  for over these increased revenues included reduced loan loss reserve expenses of  due to lower loan portfolio growth 
the average outstanding loans was up much more significantly than the actual growth because the loans were made late in and the expenses associated with those loans occurred in also 
most of this growth and corresponding expense occurred in the fourth quarter of and accordingly was too late in that year to significantly contribute to increased net interest income for but had significant impact on the earnings in net interest income is the major component of the bank s earning capacity 
it represents the difference or spread between interest income on earning assets primarily loans  investment securities and federal funds sold and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities primarily deposits 
the spread is considered positive when interest earning assets exceed interest paying liabilities 
net interest income is also affected by changes in interest rates earned and interest rates paid  and by changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
to the extent possible  the bank follows a strategy intended to insulate the bank s interest rate spread from adverse changes in interest rates by maintaining spreads through the adjustability of its earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
at december   approximately of the loan portfolio was repriceable or expected to repay within one year 
results of operations can be measured by various ratio analyses 
two widely recognized performance indicators are return on equity and return on assets 
the bank s return on average equity was in  up from in  and below the of the bank s returns on average assets roaa were in and 
in to in in  the board of directors adopted a strategy of growth for the bank knowing that the increased overhead would impact the bank s earnings for several years 
the strategy anticipated that increased revenues would eventually offset the substantial increase in overhead resulting from branch openings 
this in fact happened in through with the slower growth in overhead expenses  earnings improved during those years 
with the opening of the new branch in  some of the overhead efficiencies were lost  but were regained in and early in  the bank increased staffing in both the financial product sales staff and in the loan production area 
by the fourth quarter of  both areas began showing significant increases in in income to the bank 
in addition  the bank s acquisition of the trust company of florida in march increased the company s trust assets by 
by june  the majority of the merger related expenses had been absorbed and the acquisition was adding to the bank s earnings 

table of contents loans loan portfolio the following table shows the bank s loans distribution at the end of each of the last five years 
december  thousand of dollars domestic loans commercial and other real estate construction real estate residential real estate other installment consumer non accrual total domestic loans real estate mortgage loans at year end and comprised the greatest percentage of total loans 
commercial non real estate and consumer loans were approximately and respectively at the year end the growth in loans outstanding at year end was the result of an initiative by management to grow the loan portfolio 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb potential losses in the loan portfolio 
management s methodology to determine the adequacy of the allowance considers specific credit reviews  past loan loss experience  current economic conditions and trends  and the volume  growth and composition of the loan portfolio 
each credit on the bank s internal loan watch list is evaluated periodically to estimate potential losses 
in addition  minimum estimates for each category of watch list credits also are provided based on management s judgment of past loan loss experience and other factors 
the total of reserves resulting from this analysis is allocated reserves 
the amounts specifically provided for individual loans and pools of loans are supplemented by an unallocated amount for loan losses 
this unallocated amount is determined based on judgments regarding risk of error in the specific allocation  other potential exposure in the loan portfolio  economic conditions and trends  amounts and timing of future cash flows  and other factors 

table of contents composition of allowance for loan losses this table shows an allocation of the allowance for loan losses as of the last two year ends december  december  loans in each loans in each category to category to total loans total loans amount percent amount percent thousands of dollars commercial  commercial re  construction agricultural real estate residential consumer special allocations unallocated total the above allocation is based on estimates and subjective judgments and is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts or loan categories in which losses may ultimately occur 
in the allowance for loan losses approximates of loans  equal to the in the allowance for loan losses is changed when management determines that the prospects of recovery of the principal or interest of a loan or lease are doubtful 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
real estate mortgage loans are written down to fair value upon the earlier receipt of a deed in lieu of foreclosure  upon completion of foreclosure proceedings  or upon in substance foreclosure 
commercial and other loan charge offs are made based on management s on going evaluation of non performing loans 
at year end  the bank had no impaired loans under sfas  which became effective on january  non performing assets non performing assets include non accrual  accruing loans past due days or more  and other real estate  which includes foreclosures  deeds in lieu of foreclosure and in substance foreclosures 
a loan is classified as an in substance foreclosure when the borrower has little or no equity in the collateral and the bank can reasonably expect proceeds for repayment only from the operation or sale of the collateral 
a loan generally is classified as non accrual when full collection of principal or interest is doubtful or a loan becomes days past due as to principal or interest 
unless management determines that the estimated net realizable value of the collateral is greater than the unpaid principal and interest  interest accrual is discontinued 
unpaid interest previously credited to income in the current year is reserved  and unpaid interest accrued in prior years is charged to the allowance for loan losses 
a non performing loan is returned to performing status when the loan is brought current and has performed in accordance with contract terms for a period of time 

table of contents distribution of non performing assets december thousands of dollars commercial  commercial re  construction residential re installment consumer total non performing loans other real estate owned other assets debt security total non performing assets non performing loans to year end loans non performing assets to year end loans and other real estate owned management continually reviews any non performing assets and any uncollectible portions of the asset have been charged off 
when the bank has non performing assets  management strives to assure that the amounts reflected on the books fairly represent the net realizable value of that asset 
however  the time required to liquidate the asset is undeterminable due to the time required to proceed through the court systems and the time required to market the collateral 
at year end the bank had no non accrual loans  compared to  in  and consequently there was no additional interest income that would have been recorded on non accruing loans 
at december   the bank had no loans  which were not included in the day past due or non accrual categories  where the borrowers are currently experiencing or have recently experienced financial difficulties but are current on their payments 
this is unchanged from at december   the bank had no commitments to lend additional funds with respect to non performing loans 
in evaluating loan portfolio risk  management believes that any significant future increases in non performing loans are dependent to a large extent on the economic environment 
in a deteriorating or uncertain economy  management applies more conservative assumptions when assessing the future prospects of borrowers and when estimating collateral values 
this may result in a higher number of loans being classified as non performing 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate was in which is up from in the effective rate is lower than the statutory rate primarily due to certain tax exempt interest income 
impact of inflation and changing prices the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
another significant effect of inflation is on other expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
management believes the most significant impact on financial results is the bank s ability to react to changes in interest rates 
as discussed previously  management is attempting to maintain an essentially balanced position between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  the bank had commitments to originate and disperse on loans of approximately  and  respectively 
substantially all of both years figures include commitments to originate construction real estate loans and pre approved commercial lines of credit 
the bank expects that all of the commitments at december  will be exercised within the current year 
in addition  at december  and  the bank had in place letters of credit of approximately  and  respectively 
the bank does not expect that any of the standby letters of credit in place at december  will be exercised within the current year
