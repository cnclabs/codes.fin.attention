item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the description of business  financial statements and the related notes of ade which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect ade s plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below and in the forward looking statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview ade was incorporated in to develop and market certain advanced concepts and designs in capacitance and other measurement technologies suitable for industrial applications requiring precise  reliable  damage free and repeatable measurements 
our products have evolved from single instruments used in off line engineering analysis to multi function systems for automated in line monitoring of process induced defects throughout the semiconductor wafer  device  magnetic data storage and optics manufacturing processes 
we operate three major business segments  the semiconductor systems group ssg  ade phase shift pst and ade technologies ati 
ssg manufactures multifunctional semiconductor metrology and automation systems and optical wafer defect inspection equipment used to detect particles and other defects on silicon wafer surfaces 
pst manufactures high performance  non contact surface metrology equipment using advanced interferometric technology that provides enhanced yield management to the data storage  semiconductor and optics industries 
ati manufactures high precision magnetic characterization and non contact dimensional metrology gauging systems primarily for the magnetic data storage and semiconductor manufacturing industries 
historically  the semiconductor wafer and device industries and the magnetic data storage industry have been highly cyclical and have experienced both rapid periods of growth and rapid downturns that can be abrupt and result in significant changes in revenue and profits 
during an industry wide downturn  the demand for capital equipment significantly decreases as the company s customers reduce production of semiconductor wafers and devices 
beginning in fiscal year  the company experienced decreased demand for its products in all business segments as a result of a downturn in the semiconductor wafer and device manufacturing industries as well as the data storage industry 
consequently  the company experienced reduced order levels and revenues during fiscal year and early fiscal in response to the industry downturn  the company underwent cost reduction measures  including headcount reductions  and focused its research and development activities on projects to place the company in the best possible position for the next wave of capital spending in the semiconductor wafer and device manufacturing industries as well as the magnetic data storage industry 
beginning in the second half of fiscal year and continuing through the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company experienced sequential increases in quarterly revenue in all but the first quarter of fiscal as a result  the company has achieved profitability  on a quarterly basis  since the third quarter of fiscal year these results were due in part to increased worldwide order activity during fiscal years  and the first quarter of fiscal as well as the aforementioned cost reduction measures 
however  although revenue for the 
table of contents fourth quarter of fiscal increased compared to the third quarter  the company s bookings have decreased slightly over the last three quarters of fiscal at this time  the company cannot determine if this decrease in order activity is indicative of the beginning of a down cycle in the semiconductor manufacturing industry or if it is just a momentary pause while the industry absorbs the equipment ordered in the recent expansion 
as such  the company makes no assurances that current order  revenue  backlog and profit levels can be sustained in future periods 
in addition  because we rely on a limited number of suppliers  we expect to experience delays from time to time when our demand exceeds our suppliers capacities as recently occurred with respect to high quality optical glass materials 
restructurings during the first quarter of fiscal  as a result of continued cost cutting initiatives  the company recorded a restructuring charge of  which consisted primarily of severance expenses for terminated employees 
the employees were terminated from various functional areas within the company s semiconductor systems and ade technologies business segments 
the majority of all the severance payments from the first quarter restructuring were made by the end of fiscal year in connection with the first quarter restructuring  the company did not renew its lease at its bethel  connecticut facility  which expired in august prior to the end of the first quarter  the operations of the bethel facility were relocated to the westwood  massachusetts and tucson  arizona facilities 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company implemented selective headcount reductions and closed three satellite offices in response to the prolonged downturn in the semiconductor wafer and device manufacturing and magnetic data storage industries 
the company recorded a restructuring charge of  which consisted of  in employee severance expenses for the terminated employees spread across all functional areas of the company and  related to the closing of the satellite offices  which primarily represents future lease obligations on the vacated offices 
when applicable  anticipated future sublease income relating to vacated offices was offset against the charge for the remaining lease payments 
during the second quarter of fiscal  as a result of the continued downturn in the semiconductor wafer and device manufacturing and magnetic data storage industries  the company recorded a restructuring charge of  which consisted primarily of severance expenses for the terminated employees across all segments and various functional areas of the company 
on august   an agreement was entered into between the company and its former chief executive officer  robert c 
abbe 
under the terms of the agreement  ade agreed to pay a total of million over a three year period  beginning in september  for severance and consulting services 
the company recorded a restructuring charge of  for the severance portion of mr 
abbe s agreement  which was paid through september this amount is included in the  discussed above 
the consulting portion of the agreement was expensed as incurred 
below is a table summarizing the activity related to the restructuring accrual for the years ended april   and severance office closures total in thousands restructuring accrual cash payments balance at april  restructuring accrual cash payments balance at april  cash payments balance at april  
table of contents sale of long term investment on july   the company entered into an agreement to sell the majority of its ownership in jal to kanematsu electronics  ltd  the other owner of jal 
the company received proceeds of million and realized a gain of million from this transaction 
the company retained a ownership interest in jal 
prior to the transaction  the company accounted for its investment in jal under the equity method 
as a result of the decrease in both ownership and influence over the affairs of jal  the company accounts for its remaining interest under the cost method 
the million gain on the transaction was calculated as follows ade shares held prior to sale kel shares held prior to sale total ownership shares shares sold by ade shares retained by ade in thousands book value of ade investment at less dividend received add income from affiliate april june book value of ade investment before sale book value per share before sale book value of shares sold proceeds from sale gain on sale of ownership prior to july   when the company was accounting for its investment in jal under the equity method  the revenue from sales to jal  which had not in turn been sold by jal to unrelated third parties  was eliminated and the related profit on such sales was recorded as deferred income on sales to affiliate 
as a result of the reduction of the company s investment in jal to and the change in accounting method for the remaining investment to the cost method  the company recognized approximately million of system and parts revenue in its statement of operations that otherwise may have been deferred revenue on the balance sheet as of july  cost of revenue  systems and parts in the statement of operations increased by million during the quarter ended july  as a result of the sale of part of the company s jal investment 
therefore  gross profit in the statement of operations increased by million during the same period 
sale leaseback on july   the company entered into an agreement to sell and leaseback its headquarters site in westwood  massachusetts  which resulted in a deferred gain of million 
the company used million of the approximately million in proceeds  less transaction costs  from the transaction to retire its industrial development bond the bond and terminated the related letter of credit 
on july   the company used approximately million of the proceeds to retire its industrial development bond the bond  which resulted in million of restricted cash becoming available for general corporate purposes 
as part of this transaction  the company entered into a lease agreement with a year term and annual rent payments increasing from approximately million at the beginning of the lease term to approximately million by the end of the lease term 
the lease has been classified as an operating lease and the gain of million on the transaction has been deferred and is being amortized as a reduction of rent expense on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
the total rent expense from the lease is being amortized on a straight line basis 

table of contents critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures at the date of and for the periods reflected in the company s financial statements 
management continually evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  and warranty obligations 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  accounting for income taxes  valuation of goodwill and software and the accounting for leases to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts the company s revenue recognition policy complies with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company s standard customer arrangement includes a signed purchase order  in which it offers payment terms of to days  no right of return of delivered products and a twelve month warranty 
the company assesses whether the fee associated with its revenue transactions is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of the fee is due after the company s normal payment terms of to days  it determines that the fee is not fixed or determinable 
in these cases  the company recognizes revenue as the fees become due 
the company assesses collectibility based on the credit worthiness of the customer and past transaction history 
the company performs initial credit evaluations of its customers and does not require collateral from its customers 
for many of the company s international customers  it requires that an irrevocable letter of credit be issued by the customer before the purchase order is accepted 
if the company determines that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  it defers the fee and recognizes the revenue at the time that collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon the receipt of cash 
for some of the company s sales transactions  a portion  usually  of the fee is not due until installation occurs and the customer accepts the product 
the other of the fee is normally due to days after shipment 
if the company has met defined customer acceptance experience levels with a specific type of product  these transactions are accounted for as multiple element arrangements with the deferral of the portion of the fee not due until installation is complete and customer acceptance has occurred 
management of the company must make a determination of what constitutes an appropriate experience level with a product 
this determination is based on  but not limited to  the extent to which a product contains significantly new technology  the number of similarly configured products previously delivered and the company s experience with a particular customer 
for new products  the company must obtain at least three acceptances before it will recognize the portion of the fee upon shipment 
all other sales with customer acceptance provisions are recognized as revenue upon customer acceptance 
the portion of the fee related to the installation of the product and customer training is classified as service revenue 
the company s transactions frequently involve the sales of systems and services under multiple element arrangements 
revenue under multiple element arrangements is allocated to all elements except systems based upon the fair value of those elements 
the amounts allocated to training are based upon the price charged when this element is sold separately and unaccompanied by the other elements 
the amount allocated to installation revenue is based upon hourly rates and the estimated time to complete the service 
the amount allocated to system and parts is done on a residual method basis 
under this method  the total arrangement value is allocated first to undelivered elements  based on their fair values  with the remainder being allocated to system revenue 

table of contents the company accrues for anticipated warranty costs upon shipment 
warranty costs are estimated based on an analysis of historical cost information 
service revenue is recognized as the services are performed provided collection of the related receivable is probable 
service contract revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual periods in which the services are provided 
revenue from software licenses is recognized when an agreement has been executed  software has been delivered  fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
revenue from systems sales to jal  the company s previously owned affiliate and a distributor of the company s products  by the ssg  ati and pst segments was reflected in segment revenue during the period they were shipped by the respective segment  which could differ from the period the revenue was recognized for consolidated financial reporting purposes 
consolidated revenue on systems sales to jal was recognized when the related product or software was shipped to and accepted by the end user of the product or software 
as a result of the company s decreased investment in jal  beginning july   all sales to jal are reflected in both segment and consolidated revenue in the same period 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a continuous review of customer accounts  payment patterns and specific collection issues 
where specific collection issues are identified  the company records a specific allowance based on the amount that the company believes will be collected 
for accounts where specific collection issues are not identified  the company will record a reserve based on the age of the receivable and historical collection patterns 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory on a monthly basis 
the company s policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts 
inventory that  in the judgment of management  is obsolete or in excess of the company s estimated usage is written down to its estimated market value  if less than its cost 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s estimates related to current economic trends  future demand for the company s products  and technological obsolescence 
significant management judgments must be made when establishing the reserve for obsolete and excess inventory 
if the company s judgments and estimates relating to obsolete and excess inventory prove to be inadequate  its financial results could be materially adversely affected in future periods 
if the inventory value is written down to its net realizable value  and subsequently there is an increased demand for the inventory at a higher value  the increased value of the inventory is not realized until the inventory is sold 
accounting for income taxes the company records income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company s financial statements contain certain deferred tax assets  which have arisen primarily as a result of operating losses incurred in prior years  as well as other temporary differences between book and tax accounting 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes  its deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against its net deferred tax assets 
during the quarter ended april   based on its evaluation of all available evidence  both positive and negative  the company determined that it was more likely than not that it would realize the benefit of the majority of its deferred tax assets 
as a result  the company reversed million of its deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the decision to reverse the valuation allowance required significant judgment 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is based on significant estimates  and it is at least reasonably possible that changes in these estimates in the future could materially affect the company s financial condition 
table of contents and results of operations 
the company s effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes in estimated taxable income or loss  changes to the valuation allowance  changes to federal  state or foreign tax laws  and deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction 
goodwill and intangible assets intangible assets consist of million of goodwill obtained through the acquisition of the semiconductor solutions division of lpa software  inc in september as well as million  net of amortization  of capitalized license fees for software included in the company s products 
the company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company is required to perform impairment tests under sfas annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the goodwill may be impaired 
factors the company considers important that could trigger the impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant negative industry or economic trends significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period significant decline in the company s technological value as compared to the market the company s market capitalization relative to net book value unanticipated competition 
during the fourth quarter in each of the fiscal years ended april  and  the company performed its annual impairment test in accordance with sfas and determined that the carrying value of its goodwill was not impaired 
as of april   net capitalized license fees of million for software included in the company s products are amortized at the greater of the ratio that current gross revenue for the related products bears to the total current and anticipated future gross revenue for those products or on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life 
at each quarter end  the carrying value of the software is compared to net realizable value nrv 
nrv is the estimated future gross revenues from products that incorporate the software reduced by the estimated future costs of disposal 
if nrv is less than the carrying value  the excess is written off and nrv becomes the new carrying value of the software 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made when establishing criteria for future cash flows  estimating reporting unit fair value and assessing impairment 
if the company s judgments and estimates relating to goodwill and software prove to be inadequate  an asset may be determined to be impaired and the company s financial results could be materially adversely impacted 
likewise  if a future event or circumstance indicates that an impairment assessment is required and  through the performance of that assessment  an asset is determined to be impaired  the company s financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
accounting for leases on july   the company entered into a lease agreement for its corporate headquarters in westwood  massachusetts 
the classification of this lease as an operating lease involved a significant judgement by the company s management with respect to the company s incremental borrowing rate 
at the date of lease inception  the incremental borrowing rate is a significant element of the calculation in one of the four tests that must be performed to determine if a lease should be classified as an operating lease or a capital lease 
the 
table of contents company s management determined the company s incremental borrowing rate based on an analysis of its negotiations with various financial institutions  the implicit interest rate in the lease for the westwood  massachusetts building and an estimate of the current yield on debt financing of comparable companies in the public securities markets 
because the criteria necessary for classification as a capital lease were not met  the lease was accounted for as an operating lease and the leased building and related liability have not been recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
if the company s incremental borrowing rate was determined to be lower than what was determined by the company s management  the lease could have met the criteria for classification as a capital lease  which would have resulted in an asset of approximately million and a liability of approximately million being recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has not created  and is not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not consolidated into its financial statements 
the company does not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into its financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect its liquidity or the availability of capital resources  except as set forth below under liquidity and capital resources 
results of operations the following table presents the percentage of total revenue for the respective line items in ade s consolidated statements of operations 
year ended april  revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development marketing and sales general and administrative restructuring charges income loss from operations gain on sale of long term investment gain on sale of marketable securities interest and other income expense  net equity in net earnings of affiliated companies benefit from provision for income taxes net income loss fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  systems and parts revenue 
systems and parts revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal revenue in the ssg segment increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in revenues from the company s products in the ssg segment was due primarily to increased demand for its mm products 
systems and parts revenue in the pst segment increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in revenue from the pst segment was due primarily to increased demand for its mm optical based flatness tools 
system and parts revenue from the products that are marketed to the data storage industry by the company s ati segment increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase can be attributed primarily to increased demand for ati s magnetics products 

table of contents a breakdown of the company s total revenues by industry is as follows year ended april  wafer device oem magnetic data storage total the company s total revenues by region are distributed as follows year ended april  united states japan asia pacific europe total for the first quarter of fiscal  the company anticipates consolidated total revenue in the range of million to million 
service revenue 
service revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the company s service revenue consists of fees for installation  training  product maintenance and technical support services 
the majority of the company s service revenue is derived from the ssg segment 
the increase is primarily due to service calls related to customers bringing and keeping equipment on line to meet higher demand levels 
gross profit systems and parts 
gross profit increased to in fiscal from in fiscal gross profit in the ssg segment decreased slightly to in fiscal compared to in fiscal due primarily to changes in product mix 
gross profit in the pst segment increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal due to changes in product mix 
gross profit in the ati segment increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal due to continuing improvements in cost controls and efficiencies along with changes in product mix 
in general  sales to japan are made through distributors who buy the company s products at a discount and then perform installation and service after reselling the products to the end user 
as a result  sales to japan tend to have a lower gross margin than sales made to other parts of the world  which are made through internal and external sales representatives who are compensated by means of commissions 
commissions expense is included in marketing and sales expense 
changes in product mix impact the company s gross profit 
consequently  the gross profit in one period may not be indicative of the gross profit in future periods 
gross profit service 
gross profit increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increased gross profit was primarily the result of both increased revenues related to service calls and decreased material and repair costs compared to fiscal for the first quarter of fiscal  the company anticipates total consolidated gross margins in the range of to 
research and development 
research and development expense increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal but decreased as a percentage of revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in expense was primarily due to increased payroll expense 
the decrease in expense as a percentage of revenues reflects the increased revenue mentioned above 
the company continues to invest in its semiconductor wafer and device industry products as well as new products for the magnetic storage industry  including those that measure the magnetic properties of materials used in manufacturing disk drives 

table of contents marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  but decreased as a percentage of revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal the increased expense resulted primarily from higher commissions expense of million on sales made through internal and external sales representatives 
also contributing to the increase in expense was higher payroll expense of million 
the mix of sales channels through which the company s products are sold may have a significant impact on the company s marketing and sales expense and the results in any period may not be indicative of marketing and sales expense for future periods 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and decreased as a percentage of revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal expense decreased primarily as a result of a million decrease in legal and facility related expenses  which were offset by an increase in regulatory compliance expense of million and an increase in payroll and incentive compensation expenses of million 
the decrease in expense as a percentage of revenues reflects lower general and administrative expense and the increased revenue mentioned above 
interest income 
interest income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in interest income was primarily the result of an increase in invested cash balances and increased investment returns during fiscal interest expense 
interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the company s retirement of its and industrial development bonds in the first quarter of fiscal benefit from provision for income taxes 
the benefit from income taxes was million in fiscal compared to a provision for income taxes of  in fiscal the benefit from income taxes in fiscal consisted of a million reversal of deferred income tax valuation allowances  which was slightly offset by federal and state alternative minimum and foreign tax expense of million 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal consisted of federal and state alternative minimum taxes and foreign income taxes 
as described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  during the quarter ended april   based on its evaluation of all available evidence  both positive and negative  the company determined that it was more likely than not that it would realize the benefit of the majority of its deferred tax assets 
as a result  the company reversed million of its deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the decision to reverse the valuation allowance required significant judgment 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is based on significant estimates  and it is at least reasonably possible that changes in these estimates in the future could materially affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes in estimated taxable income or loss  changes to the valuation allowance  changes to federal  state or foreign tax laws  and deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction 
for fiscal  the company anticipates an effective tax rate of approximately 
fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  systems and parts revenue 
systems and parts revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal revenue in the ssg segment increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in revenues from the company s products in the ssg segment was due to increased demand for the company s products  particularly in japan and asia  as semiconductor wafer manufacturers have increased capacity in their production of both mm and mm wafers 
revenue in the pst segment increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in revenue from the pst segment was due primarily to industry acceptance of and the resulting increase in demand for its semiconductor industry products 
system and parts revenue from the products that are marketed to the data storage industry by the company s ati segment increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase could be attributed primarily to increased demand for ati s magnetics and dimensional products 

table of contents as a result of the company s sale of the majority of its ownership in jal on july   the company recorded revenue systems and parts revenue in its statement of operations during the first quarter ended july  of approximately million that may otherwise have been deferred revenue on the balance sheet as of july  cost of revenue  systems  and parts in the statement of operations increased by million as a result of the jal sale 
therefore  gross profit in the statement of operations increased by million during the first quarter of fiscal due to the margin from systems and parts sales recognized as a result of the sale of part of the company s jal investment 
prior to the transaction  the company accounted for its investment in jal under the equity method 
as a result of the decrease in both ownership and influence over the affairs of jal  the company will account for its remaining interest under the cost method 
because jal was an equity method investee prior to the sale on july   revenue from sales to jal  which had not in turn been sold by jal to unrelated third parties  was eliminated and the related profit on such sales was recorded to deferred income on sales to affiliate 
the change from the equity method to the cost method of accounting for the jal investment resulted in the recognition of all deferred revenue and profit from sales to jal as of the date of the sale of the majority of ade s interest in jal 
a breakdown of the company s total revenues by industry is as follows year ended april  wafer device oem magnetic data storage total the company s total revenues by region are distributed as follows year ended april  united states japan asia pacific europe total service revenue 
service revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the company s service revenue consists of fees for installation  training  product maintenance  and technical support services 
the majority of the company s service revenue is derived from the ssg segment 
the increase was primarily due to service calls to customers bringing equipment back on line to increase capacity 
gross profit systems and parts 
gross profit increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in gross profit was due to increased gross profit in the ssg segment as a result of increased volume combined with factory overhead cost reductions undertaken over the past fiscal year 
also contributing to the increase in gross profit was an increase in the gross profit of the ati segment due to increased volume as described in the discussion of system and parts revenue combined with cost reduction measures taken over the past fiscal year 
the increase in gross profit was slightly offset by a slight decrease in the gross profit of the pst segment as a result of increased overhead expenses necessary to meet increased production levels 
gross profit service 
gross profit decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decreased gross profit was the result of increased payroll expenses in the company s service organization as well as increased material costs during fiscal research and development 
research and development expense in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal and decreased as a percentage of revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in expense resulted primarily from a decrease in payroll of million and a 
table of contents decrease in consulting expense of million as previous cost reduction measures taken by the company take effect 
the decrease in payroll and consulting expenses was partially offset by an increase of million of project material expenses 
the decrease in expense as a percentage of revenues reflected the cost reduction measures mentioned above as well as the increase in revenues 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and decreased as a percentage of revenue to in fiscal and from in fiscal the decreased expense resulted from a decrease in commissions expense of million on sales made through internal and external sales representatives 
also contributing to the decrease in expense was decreased payroll expense of million and decreased travel expenses of million in all segments of the company 
the mix of sales channels through which the company s products are sold may have a significant impact on the company s marketing and sales expense and the results in any period may not be indicative of marketing and sales expense for future periods 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and decreased as a percentage of revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal expense increased primarily as a result of an increased payroll related expenses of million and an increase in legal expenses of million associated with the patent infringement lawsuit with kla  which went to trial at the end of january interest income 
interest income was million in both fiscal and fiscal interest expense 
interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the company s retirement of its and industrial development bonds in the first quarter of fiscal  which resulted in a decrease of interest expense for fiscal of million compared to fiscal provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the provision for income taxes in fiscal consists of federal and state alternative minimum taxes and foreign income taxes  which were mostly offset by a federal income tax refund of  for the years through as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets at april  significant management judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes  its deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against its net deferred tax assets 
the company evaluates the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
if the realization of deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is based on significant estimates  and it is at least reasonably possible that changes in these estimates in the near term could materially affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
if the company continues to generate profits in fiscal  it is possible that all  or a portion  of the valuation allowance will be released in fiscal selected consolidated quarterly operating results the following table presents consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period beginning may  and ending april  this information has been derived from ade s unaudited consolidated financial statements 
the unaudited financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements and include all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary to present fairly this information when read in conjunction with ade s annual audited financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
our quarterly revenue typically is derived from a relatively small number of customer orders 
these customer orders may consist of multiple systems  each of which is priced between approximately  and  as a result  the timing of significant orders or 
table of contents a reduction in the number of systems shipped in a quarter could have a material effect on our revenue and results of operations for that quarter 
the results for a particular quarter may also vary due to a number of other factors  including economic conditions in the semiconductor and magnetic data storage industries product mix of our sales for the period the sales distribution channel of our sales for the period competitive pricing pressures our ability to design  introduce and manufacture new products on a cost effective and timely basis customer cancellations or rescheduled shipments production difficulties or the inability to obtain critical components resulting in delayed shipments seasonal factors such as customers capital budget approval cycles 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
significant levels of our expenses are fixed in advance and based in part on our expectations as to future revenue
