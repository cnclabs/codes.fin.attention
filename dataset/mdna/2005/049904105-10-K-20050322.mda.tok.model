critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in the preparation of these financial statements  the company makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company believes the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies and estimates  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
during  the company accrued for legal costs associated with certain litigation 
the company believes these accruals are adequate to cover the legal fees and expenses associated with litigating these matters 
however  the time and cost required to litigate these matters as well as the outcomes of the proceedings may vary from what the company has projected 
the company assesses the impairment of its long lived identifiable assets  excluding goodwill which is tested for impairment pursuant to sfas no 
as explained below  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
this review is based upon projections of anticipated future cash flows 
while the company believes that its estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows or future changes in the company s business plan could materially affect its evaluations 
no such changes are anticipated at this time 
the company assesses goodwill for impairment pursuant to sfas no 
which requires that goodwill be assessed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  or  at a minimum  on an annual basis by applying a fair value test 
forward looking statements the statements in this management s discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this annual report on form k that are forward looking are based upon current expectations  and actual results or future events may differ materially 
therefore  the inclusion of such forward looking information should not be regarded as a representation by the company that the objectives or plans of the company will be achieved 
such statements include  but are not limited to  the company s expectations regarding future revenues  cost of goods sold  gross profit  operating income  income from continuing operations  cash flows from operations  growth in product lines  and availability of equity and debt financing 
words such as anticipates  believes  intends  expects  should and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
forward looking statements contained herein involve numerous risks and uncertainties  and there are a number of factors that could cause actual results or future events to differ materially  including  but not limited to  the following changing economic  market and business conditions  acts of war or terrorism  the effects of governmental regulation  the impact of competition and new technologies  slower than anticipated introduction of new products or implementation of marketing strategies  implementation of new manufacturing processes or implementation of new information systems  the company s ability to protect its intellectual property  changes in the prices of raw materials  changes in product mix  intellectual property and product liability claims and product recalls  the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and the loss of any significant customers 
in addition  assumptions relating to budgeting  marketing  product development and other management decisions are subjective in many respects and thus susceptible to interpretations and periodic review which may cause the company to alter its marketing  capital expenditures or other budgets  which in turn may affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates the company has a million credit facility with a money center bank
