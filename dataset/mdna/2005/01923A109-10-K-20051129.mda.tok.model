prior to  we had been committed to implementing tax strategies that provided for the sale of appreciated assets  including a portion of our ownership interest in our uk subsidiaries  to generate sufficient taxable income to realize our u 
s tax net operating losses prior to their expiration 
while we believed that we would realize the value of our tax losses  developments in  including the continued expansion of our uk operations  had increased the uncertainty as to both the execution of the original strategy and the appropriateness of a tax strategy that may not align with our current business strategy 
these uncertainties impaired our ability to determine whether it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized 
accordingly  in fiscal  a full valuation allowance for all remaining us deferred tax assets was provided

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k and in conjunction with the description of our business included in this annual report on form k 
it is intended to assist the reader in understanding and evaluating our financial position 
this discussion contains  in addition to historical information  forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainty 
our actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed in this annual report on form k under forward looking statements 
we are a leading provider of flexible  or temporary  healthcare staffing to the uk healthcare industry as measured by revenues  market share and number of staff 
as of september  we operated an integrated network of approximately branches throughout most of the united kingdom 
our healthcare staff consists principally of nurses  nurses aides and home health aides 
we focus on placing our staff on a per diem basis in hospitals  nursing homes  care homes and private homes 
we maintain a pool of over  nurses  nurses aides and home health aides 
we also supply medical grade oxygen for use in respiratory therapy to the uk pharmacy market and northern ireland and oxygen concentrators to customers in northern ireland 
we have engaged in an ongoing series of activities to strengthen our organizational structure and reposition us for future growth 
these actions have included a reorganization in branch structure  adopting and implementing a new corporate identity and investing in a new it system 
we continually review our operations in order to improve operating efficiencies and to be responsive to changing market conditions 
the introduction and further extension of the nhs framework agreements has continued to impact our financial results by reducing our margins from that source of business 
in addition  we have experienced reduced revenues from the nhs as a result of the nhs framework agreements  as well as the efforts of the nhs to source more of its work from its own employee base and its in house agency nhs professionals 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the unites states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures in a given reporting period 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical areas affecting our financial condition and results of operations where estimates are required 
accounts receivable we are required to estimate the collectibility of our accounts receivables  which requires a considerable amount of judgment in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
significant changes in required reserves may occur in the future as we continue to expand our business and as conditions in the marketplace change 
intangible assets we have significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a significant amount of judgment 
changes in strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of goodwill 
we have recorded goodwill and separately identifiable intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions through september  goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
a more frequent evaluation will be performed if indicators of impairment are present 
we completed the annual impairment test of goodwill during the fourth quarter of fiscal and determined that there was no impairment to our goodwill balance 
the calculation of fair value used for an impairment test includes a number of estimates and assumptions  including future income and cash flow projections  the identification of appropriate market multiples and the choice of an appropriate discount rate 
if we are required to record an impairment charge in the future  it could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
deferred income taxes we account for deferred income taxes based upon differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
the determination of whether or not valuation allowances are required to be recorded involves significant estimates regarding the future profitability of our company  as well as potential tax strategies for the utilization of net loss and operating loss carryforwards 
contingencies related to our acquisitions of certain flexible staffing agencies  we have entered into agreements to pay additional amounts  in cash  in the form of contingent consideration dependent upon future earnings of such acquired entities 
also  we are involved in various legal proceedings and claims incidental to our normal business activities 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
revenue recognition patient services and respiratory therapy revenues are recognized when services are performed and substantiated by proper documentation 
for patient services  which are billed at fixed rates and account for approximately of our company s business  revenue is recognized upon completion of timesheets that also require the signature of the recipient of services 
revenues from the rental of home medical equipment are recognized over the rental period typically on a month to month basis 
revenues from the sale of oxygen and supplies for use in respiratory therapy are recognized when products are shipped  a contractual arrangement exists  the sales price is either fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
we receive a majority of our revenue from the nhs and other uk governmental payors 
certain revenues are subject to review by third party payors and adjustments  if any  are recorded when determined 
purchase accounting we account for our acquisitions as purchase business combinations 
at acquisition  preliminary values and useful lives are allocated based upon fair values that have been determined for assets acquired and liabilities assumed and management s best estimates for values that have not yet been finalized 
we obtain a third party valuation in order to complete our purchase price allocations 
accordingly  final asset and liability fair values as well as useful lives may differ from management s original estimates and could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
results of operations year ended september  vs 
year ended september  revenues total revenues for the year ended september  were million compared to million for the year ended september   an increase of million or 
this increase was mainly due to acquisitions in the social services sector million and the favorable effects of changes in foreign exchange million 
this increase was offset by less demand and price pressures arising from the extension of the nhs framework agreements

the favorable effects of changes in foreign exchange accounted for million of the increase 
as a percentage of total revenue  gross profit for the year ended september  increased to from for the comparable prior period

this decrease was principally attributable to reduced bank debt in fiscal and to the write off of million of deferred financing fees and unamortized debt discount associated with the refinancing of the former senior credit facility in fiscal this decrease was partially offset by the recording of a million benefit related to the change in the fair value of our company s interest rate cap and floor collar agreement in fiscal and changes in foreign exchange of other expense total other expense for the year ended september  was million  which represents the expense related to the change in the fair value of our interest swap agreements and related ineffective portion of the interest swap cash flow hedges

in july  all of the series a preferred stock was converted into a like number of shares of common stock 
in connection with the conversion  we paid conversion fees of million to the holders of the series a preferred stock and wrote off million of the remaining issuance costs 
year ended september  vs 
year ended september  revenues total revenues for the year ended september  were million compared to million for the year ended september   an increase of million or 
this increase was mainly due to the favorable effects of changes in foreign exchange million  acquisitions in the social services sector million and internal growth in the social service sector and in our respiratory  medical equipment and supplies operations 
this increase was offset by a decrease in revenues due to changes to nhs quality standards  causing fewer of our workers to be available for placement with the nhs while the necessary training certificates  immunizations and criminal record checks required by these standards were obtained  and the expansion of the nhs professionals to encompass more healthcare workers 
there can be no assurance that the continued expansion of the nhs professionals may not adversely affect our revenues in future periods

the favorable effects of changes in foreign exchange accounted for million of the increase

changes in foreign exchange accounted for million of this increase 
the remaining increase was mainly a result of higher levels of overhead costs due principally to increased expenditures on quality assurance audit programs to ensure compliance with changes to legislation million  acquisitions million  compensation charges for key executives to complete the reimbursement of tax liabilities and to resolve other consequences incurred by them in connection with our fiscal corporate reorganization as well as a special compensation charge million and fees associated with migrating the trading of our shares of common stock from the american stock exchange to the nasdaq national market million

our home healthcare operations were concentrated in new york and new jersey and supplied infusion therapy  respiratory therapy and home medical equipment

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial results 
currently  we do not hedge foreign currency exchange rate exposures 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our cash equivalents and the senior credit facility 
our cash equivalents include highly liquid short term investments purchased with initial maturities of days or less 
to manage our exposure to interest rate changes related to our senior credit facility  we use interest rate swap agreements 
in march  upon the expiration of our prior rate cap and floor collar agreement  we entered into a rate cap and floor collar agreement that capped our interest rate and our interest floor  subject to special provisions  on approximately million of our floating rate debt under a contract that would have expired in march in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
and related implementation guidance  we calculated the fair value of the interest cap and floor derivative to be an asset of million at september  in february  we sold this derivative instrument for approximately million 
in february  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements  which expire in july  the objective of which is to protect us against the potential increase in interest rates on our floating rate debt 
the two interest rate swap agreements cover approximately million of the our floating rate debt until january and then decrease by million each six month period  in order to reflect the amortizing effect of our floating rate debt  until the end of the interest rate swap agreements 
the interest rate under the swap agreements is fixed at and is payable semi annually 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we designated the two interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we calculated the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements to be a liability of million at september  prior to the cash flow hedge designation  changes in the value from period to period of the interest rate swap agreements was recorded as other expense or income  as appropriate 
at september   the effective portion of the loss on the interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges was million  net of tax  and is included in other comprehensive income 
we will continue to assess the effectiveness of these cash flow hedges on a quarterly basis 
the interest rate on our remaining bank debt of million is reset at least every month to reflect current market rates 
consequently  the carrying value of our variable rate bank debt approximates its fair value at september
