item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview emeritus is a washington corporation organized by daniel r 
baty and two other founders in in november  we completed our initial public offering 
from through  we expanded rapidly through acquisition and internal development and by december   operated assisted living communities with  units 
we believe  however  that during this expansion  the assisted living industry became significantly over built  creating an environment characterized by sluggish or falling occupancy and market resistance to rate increases 
as a result of these difficult operating circumstances  we limited further growth and in began an increasing focus first on raising our occupancy and later on rate development  operating efficiencies and cost controls 
we believe that the health of the assisted living industry is improving and that there are developing opportunities to improve occupancy and adjust rates  as well as greater access to capital 
in light of these perceptions  we have completed several leases and acquisitions in the last three years and have converted most of our managed communities to owned or leased communities 
in and  we operated approximately communities  but in and  we increased that to and communities  respectively  primarily through the lease of communities formerly operated by marriott and through other selected leases and acquisitions 
from the end of to the end of  the communities we manage decreased from to and the owned and leased communities increased from to  reflecting both our increasing confidence in the assisted living industry and the availability of capital 
in we expect to continue reviewing acquisition opportunities 
the following table sets forth a summary of our property interests 
as of december  as of december  as of december  buildings units buildings units buildings units owned leased managed admin services joint venture partnership operated portfolio percentage increase decrease included in our consolidated portfolio of communities 
of the leased communities at the end of  are accounted for as operating leases  in which the assets and liabilities of the communities are not included in our consolidated balance sheet and are accounted for as capital leases  in which a long term asset and corresponding liability is established on our balance sheet 
the remaining leased communities are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as owned communities because of accounting requirements related to sale leaseback accounting  notwithstanding the legal sale of the communities and their subsequent leasing by us 
there were operating  capital leases and four leased communities reflected in our consolidated financial statements as owned because of accounting requirements related to sale leaseback accounting at the end of there were operating and four capital leases at the end of buildings managed decreased in primarily due to the conversion of communities from managed to leased 
the decrease in was primarily due to the termination of regent management contracts  the conversion of the 
table of contents emeritrust ii communities from managed to leased as of september   and the conversion of horizon bay communities from managed to leased as of december  one managed building has been shut down and was sold march  one management contract was terminated october  two of the important factors affecting our financial results are the rates we charge our residents and the occupancy levels we achieve in our communities 
we rely primarily on our residents ability to pay our charges for services from their own or familial resources and expect that we will do so for the foreseeable future 
although care in an assisted living community is typically less expensive than in a skilled nursing facility  we believe that generally only seniors with income or assets meeting or exceeding the regional median can afford to reside in our communities 
in this context  we must be sensitive to our residents financial circumstances and remain aware that rates and occupancy are interrelated 
in evaluating the rate component  we generally rely on the average monthly revenue per unit  computed by dividing the total revenue for a particular period by the average number of occupied units determined on a monthly basis for the same period 
in evaluating the occupancy component  we generally rely on the average occupancy rate  computed by dividing the average units occupied  during a particular period by the average number of units available  during the period 
this average is computed on a monthly basis 
we evaluate these and other operating components for our consolidated portfolio  which included the communities we own and lease  and our operating portfolio  which also includes the communities we manage as if we were the owner or lessor 
in our consolidated portfolio  our average monthly revenue per unit increased from  in to  in and to  in these changes represented increases of and for and  respectively 
we believe that these improvements were a consequence of a carefully designed rate enhancement program that we began implementing in in conjunction with acquisition of communities with higher rates per unit than our existing portfolio during that period 
in our consolidated portfolio  our average occupancy rate was in  decreasing to in and increasing to in we believe that the decrease in occupancy rates from to was primarily the result of the acquisition of communities at the end of with substantially less occupancy than our existing portfolio 
we also believe that our rate enhancement program affected occupancy growth and we continue to evaluate the factors of rate and occupancy to find the optimum balance in each community  as witnessed by the increase in occupancy rates from to  which was a result of a major marketing campaign begun in early and included re pricing of units as needed to ensure market competitiveness 
since our inception in  we have incurred operating losses and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we believe that these losses have resulted from our early emphasis on expansion  financing costs arising from multiple financing and refinancing transactions related to this expansion  administrative and corporate expenses that we incurred in anticipation of further expansion that did not materialize and occupancy rates that have declined and remained lower for longer periods than we anticipated 
significant transactions in we increased the number of communities we lease  reduced the number of communities we manage  and  in connection with these changes  increased and restructured portions of our long term financing obligations 
the transactions associated with these developments are summarized below 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents the communities are leased by us from the reit pursuant to a new master lease with a year term  with one year renewal option 
due to certain subjective default provisions and default remedies  the leases are accounted for as capital leases 
for the leases completed on september  this resulted in additions to property and equipment and capital lease and financing obligations totaling approximately million 
approximately an additional million in property and equipment and financing obligations will be recorded pursuant to the future closing of the two remaining facilities 
the initial lease payment for the facilities that have closed is approximately million per year  with inflators to the extent the change in the consumer price index exceeds  not to exceed basis points during years two through four and basis points thereafter as calculated with respect to the reit s investment basis in the properties

on september   an independent reit acquired the emeritrust ii communities for a cash purchase price of million and leased them to us 
a master lease covers the emeritrust ii communities and four other communities originally leased under a capital lease arrangement from the reit in march due to certain subjective default provisions and default remedies which allow for acceleration of all unpaid lease payments  the leases are accounted for as capital leases  which resulted in additions to property and equipment and capital lease and financing obligations totaling approximately million

the series a preferred stock had been issued originally in october for million 
as a part of the repurchase  the holder of the series a preferred stock waived approximately million in accrued and unpaid dividends 
as a result of the transaction  we recognized a gain of approximately million 
just prior to the repurchase  the series a preferred stock was accruing compounded  cumulative dividends of approximately million annually  with mandatory redemption in october at a price of million plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
in completing the repurchase  we avoided these future obligations 
we obtained the funds to complete the repurchase through three related transactions 
the first transaction involved three communities that we leased 
prior to this transaction  we also held notes receivable in the aggregate amount of million that were secured by the same three communities and under which we received interest of approximately  annually 
in the transaction  the communities were transferred to a reit  which became the new owner and lessor  and we received net proceeds of million in repayment of the notes we held and in exchange for our related security and other property interests in the communities 
the transfer of the communities was subject to our leases  the terms of which did not change 
because we disposed of our notes  we will no longer receive the interest we formerly did 
we recognized a deferred gain of approximately million  which is being amortized over the remaining life of the leases

as a part of the assumption  we provided a letter of credit against the default of the underlying debt and continued a security interest in community receivables and limited guarantees in favor of the debt holder 
these features of the transaction constitute continuing involvement for accounting purposes  preclude sale leaseback accounting  and require us to use finance accounting

due to certain legal requirements of resident notification  we leased the property back from the third party through august  in addition  on september   we committed to sell another owned facility hearthside of issaquah  which under fasb statement no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  qualifies as an asset held for sale 
a current asset of million was recorded on our financial statements and we discontinued depreciating the asset as of september  hearthside of issaquah was sold on november  since we had a continuing involvement in the community until such time as the buyer was granted a license on january   to operate the community  we deferred the gain of million until that point 
both transactions qualify for discontinued operations treatment under fasb statement no

the jury awarded a verdict against us in the amount of million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages 
the verdict was in connection with an action that alleged negligence brought by the relatives of a resident at one of our assisted living facilities 
we are immediately appealing the verdict based on significant legal errors we believe occurred at the trial 
we have posted funds in the amount of million in order to stay the proceedings while the appellate process runs its course  which could be anywhere from months to three years 
we will not be required to pay additional amounts until the appeal and further litigation is completed or the case is settled 
we have recorded a reserve on our consolidated balance sheet for the judgment against us with a corresponding charge on our consolidated statements of operations in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents results of operations summary of significant accounting policies and use of estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to resident programs and incentives such as move in fees  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets  income taxes  restructuring  long term service contracts  contingencies  self insured retention  health insurance  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies are most significant to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revisions in such estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
for commercial general liability and professional liability insurance for  we formed a wholly owned captive insurance company domiciled in the us the insurance policy issued by the captive is claims made and insures liabilities associated with general and professional liability 
the policy insures on a per occurrence and aggregate limit basis in excess of a self insured retention 
we accrue losses based upon actuarial estimates of the total aggregate liability for claims occurring within the year  plus captive related expenses 
losses  whether within the self insured retention  the policy limits  or exceeding policy limits are covered through a self insurance pool agreement with all managed communities on a per unit of capacity basis 
should losses exceed actuarial estimates  additional expense may be accrued at the time of determination 
the captive was capitalized and the premium structure established pursuant to regulatory requirements 
emeritus pays premiums based in part on a fixed schedule and in part as losses are actually paid 
the captive is subject to regulatory agency oversight and is reviewed for compliance with applicable law 
results from these reviews may change the timing or amount of subsequent funding 
for health insurance  we self insure each covered member up to a certain level above which  for certain covered members  a catastrophic insurance policy covers any additional costs 
health insurance expense is accrued based upon historical experience of the aggregate liability for claims incurred 
if these estimates are insufficient  additional charges may be required 
workers compensation insurance coverage applies for specific insurable states excluding texas  new york  and the compulsory state funds states through a high deductible  fully collateralized insurance policy 
the policy premium is based upon standard rates applied to estimated annual payroll 
the posted collateral is greater than expected annual losses 
we contract with an independent third party administrator to administer the claims  and paid claim expenses are drawn from a collateral account 
the sum of the premium and related costs  estimated administration costs  and actuarial based estimated losses is accrued on a monthly basis based on actual payroll 
the difference between the posted collateral and estimated actual losses is carried as an asset on the balance sheet 
at policy expiration  an insurer audit is conducted to adjust premiums based on actual  rather than estimated  annual payroll 
any premium adjustment for the differences between management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents estimated and actual payroll will first be applied to the accrued asset and then  if needed  as an adjustment to workers compensation expense at the time such adjustment is determined 
the insurer also audits the total incurred claim amount at least annually and may adjust the applicable policy year collateral requirement 
there is a reasonable expectation that the total incurred losses will be less than the posted collateral and the benefit of any over collateralization will inure to the company 
we insure occupational injuries and illness in new york through participation in a self insured group pool on a guaranteed cost insurance policy basis  with the premium payable monthly 
the insurer group contracts with an independent third party administrator on behalf of its members to manage the claims  and claim expenses are paid by the insurer 
for work related injuries in texas  we provide work related injury benefits through a qualified non subscriber employee retirement income security act occupational injury and illness benefit plan 
claim expenses are paid as incurred and estimated losses are accrued on a monthly basis based on actual payroll 
an insurance policy is in place to cover liability losses in excess of a deductible amount 
we contract with an independent third party administrator to manage the claims 
we account for stock option awards to employees under the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under this method  no compensation expense is recorded provided the exercise price is equal to or greater than the quoted market price of the stock at the grant date 
we make pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the fair value based method of accounting the alternative method of accounting for stock based compensation had been applied as required by fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the fair value based method requires us to make assumptions to determine expected risk free interest rates  stock price volatility  dividend yield and weighted average option life 
to the extent such things as actual volatility or life of the options is different from estimated  amounts expensed will be more or less than would have been recorded otherwise 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our residents to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our residents were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized which at this time shows a net asset valuation of zero 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
however  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
we account for impairment of long lived assets  which include property and equipment  investments  and amortizable intangible assets  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets or sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  as applicable 
an impairment review is performed whenever a change in condition occurs  which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable 
such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans  changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual communities 
we use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use 
such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized  as well as market values and conditions 
the computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions 
any changes in these factors or management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value 
we account for leases as either operating  capital  or financing leases depending on the underlying terms 
the determination of the classification of leases is complex and in certain situations requires a significant level of judgment 
leases are generally accounted for as operating leases to the extent the underlying lease does not i transfer ownership by the end of the lease term  ii contain a bargain purchase option  iii include a lease term equal to or greater than of the economic life of the leased property  or iv include minimum lease payments for which the present value equals or exceeds of the fair value of the underlying leased property 
properties under operating leases are not included on the balance sheet and are accounted for in the statement of operations as facility lease expense for actual rent paid to the extent any increases in rent is considered to be contingent and not determinable 
in cases where there are rent escalator provisions that have fixed or determinable increases  the operating leases are accounted for as the total rent for the term of the lease  including both base rent and fixed annual increases  on a straight line basis over the lease term 
this accounting treatment results in greater facility lease expense than the actual rent paid in the earlier years of the respective leases and less facility lease expense than the actual rent paid in the later years of the lease 
those leases that meet one of the criteria described above cannot be accounted for as operating leases but are accounted for as capital leases 
for properties under capital lease arrangements  a liability is established on the balance sheet based on the present value of the rent payments not to exceed the fair value of the underlying leased property  including base rent  fixed annual increases and any other payment obligations over the lease term  and a corresponding long term asset is recorded 
lease payments are allocated between principal and interest on the lease obligation and the capital lease asset is depreciated over the term of the lease 
typically  capital lease treatment results in greater depreciation and interest than actual lease payments paid in the early years of the leases and less depreciation and interest than actual rent paid in the later years of the leases 
properties that are sold and leased back and for which we have continuing involvement are accounted for as financings  in which the property remains on the balance sheet and a financing obligation is recorded generally equal to the purchase price of the properties sold 
the impact on the statement of operations is similar to a capital lease

on the maturity date  we will make a balloon payment equal to the outstanding balance of this note including the outstanding principal balance  all accrued and unpaid interest and all charges  expenses  and other amounts payable by us to hrt 
we will not have the privilege of prepaying on the note in whole or in part at any time without the prior written consent of hrt  at hrt s sole discretion 
in addition  the note contains certain subjective default clauses  which  as a remedy  allows hrt to declare the loan to be immediately due and payable 
in connection with the loan modification  hrt also extended an additional million to us on the same terms as the restated loan from hrt to pay off certain transaction cost advances that matured in march and had an interest rate of increasing to in april 
in  and continuing in the first quarter of we refinanced substantially all of our debt obligations  extending the maturities of such financings to dates in or thereafter  at which time we will need to refinance or otherwise repay the obligations 
as a consequence of our property and lease transactions in  our long term debt has decreased from million at december   to million at december   our obligations under operating leases have decreased from million to million  and our capital lease and financing obligations have increased from million to million 
in particular  the number of communities we lease increased from at december  to at december  we believe that  on the basis of the operating results of these communities many of which we managed prior to the commencement of the leases  the cash flow from such communities will be adequate to support the increased lease obligations 
many of our debt instruments and leases contain cross default provisions pursuant to which a default under one obligation can cause a default under one or more other obligations to the same lender or lessor 
such cross default provisions affect owned assisted living properties and operated under leases 
accordingly  any event of default could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition if such debt or leases are cross defaulted 
defaults can include certain financial covenants  which generally relate to lease coverage and cash flow 
in addition  we are required to maintain the leased properties in a reasonable and prudent manner 
for the year ended december   we expected to be in compliance at least through and for the foreseeable future 
however  in  we were in violation of one or more covenants in certain of our leases  but have been able to obtain waivers from the owners such that we were still deemed to be in compliance and thus  were not in default 
management believes that we will be able to sustain positive operating cash flow at least through and for the foreseeable future and will have adequate cash from operations for all necessary investing and financing activities including required debt service and capital expenditures

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin no 

this interpretation was revised in december fin no 
r and addresses consolidation by business enterprises of vie s 
a vie is subject to the consolidation provisions of fin no 
r if it cannot support its financial activities without additional subordinated financial support from third parties or its equity investors lack any one of the following characteristics the ability to make decisions about its activities through voting rights  the obligation to absorb losses of the entity if they occur  or the right to receive residual returns of the entity if they occur 
fin no 
r requires a vie to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the party that holds the variable interests that expose it to a majority of the entity s expected losses and or residual returns 
for purposes of determining a primary beneficiary  all related party interests must be combined with our actual interests in the vie 
the application of this interpretation is immediate for vie s created or altered after january   and is effective at the end of the first quarter of for variable interest entities that existed prior to february  we have evaluated the impact of fin no 
r on all our current related party management agreements  including those more fully discussed under the section denoted as emeritrust transactions  as well as other management agreements and other arrangements with potential vie s 
we doe not believe we have any vie s that require consolidation 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
for public enterprises  like us  this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  management has determined that none of our current financial instruments are covered by this pronouncement 
in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised r share based payment 
this statement requires us to recognize in the income statement expense for compensation cost related to share based payments including stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
fasb no 
r would eliminate our ability to account for share based awards to employees using apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees and would require that the transactions use a fair value method as of the grant date 
fasb r addresses the accounting for transactions in which we receive employee services in exchange for equity instruments or liabilities that are based on the fair value of our equity instruments or that may be settled through the issuance of such equity instruments 
fasb r is effective for us after june  we are currently evaluating the impact of this statement on our financial statements 
impact of inflation to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on emeritus 
inflation could  however  affect our future revenues and operating income due to our dependence on the senior resident population  most of whom rely on relatively fixed incomes to pay for our services 
the monthly charges for the resident s unit and assisted living services are influenced by the location of the community and local competition 
our ability to increase revenues in proportion to increased operating expenses may be limited 
we typically do not rely to a significant extent on governmental reimbursement programs 
in pricing our services  we attempt to anticipate inflation levels  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to respond to inflationary pressures in the future 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents risk factors our business  results of operations and financial condition are subject to many risks  including  but not limited to  those set forth below the following important factors  among others  could cause actual operating results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements included in this report and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time 
do not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this report 
a number of the matters and subject areas discussed in this report refer to potential future circumstances  operations and prospects  and therefore  are not historical or current facts 
the discussion of such matters and subject areas is qualified by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations  which may materially differ from our actual future experience involving any one or more of such matters and subject areas as a result of various factors  including possible excess assisted living capacity in our market areas affecting our occupancy and pricing levels  uncertainties in increasing occupancy and pricing  generally  effective management of costs and the effects of cost increases beyond our control  such as utilities and insurance  the difficulty in reducing and eliminating continuing operating losses  vulnerability to defaults in our debt and lease financing as a result of noncompliance with various covenants  the effects of cross default terms  competition  and uncertainties relating to construction  licensing  environmental  and other matters that affect acquisition  disposition and development of assisted living communities 
we have attempted to identify  in context  certain of the factors that may cause actual future experience and results to differ from our current expectations regarding the relevant matter or subject area 
we are not obligated to release publicly the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
these and other factors are discussed in more detail below 
we have incurred losses since we began doing business and may continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
we organized and began operations in july and have operated at a loss since we began doing business 
for   and  we recorded net losses before preferred dividends of million  million  and million  respectively as discussed in detail under net income loss and property related expense in comparison of the years ended december  and 
we believe that the historically aggressive growth of our portfolio through acquisitions and developments and related financing activities  as well as our inability along with much of the assisted living industry to increase occupancy rates at our communities  were among the causes of these losses 
to date  at many of our communities  we have been generally able to stabilize occupancy and rate structures to levels that have resulted in positive cash flow but not earnings for the company as a whole 
our operations may not become profitable in line with our current expectations or may not become profitable at all 
if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow to cover required interest  principal and lease payments  we risk defaults on our debt agreements and leases 
at december   we had total debt of million  with minimum principal payments of about million due in at december   we were obligated under both long term operating and capital leases requiring minimum annual cash lease payments of which million is payable in in addition  we will have approximately million and million in principal amount of debt repayment obligations that become due in and  respectively 
we also have million of debentures that are due on january  if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to make such payments as required and are unable to renegotiate payments or obtain additional equity or debt financing  a lender could foreclose on our communities secured by the respective indebtedness or  in the case of an operating lease  could terminate our lease  resulting in loss of income and asset value 
in some cases  our indebtedness is secured by a particular community and a pledge of our interests in a subsidiary entity that owns that community 
in the event of a default  a lender could avoid judicial procedures required to foreclose on real property by foreclosing on our pledge instead  thus accelerating its acquisition of that community 
furthermore  because of cross default and cross collateralization provisions in certain of our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents mortgage and sale leaseback agreements  if we default on one of our payment obligations  we could adversely affect a significant number of our communities 
because we are highly leveraged  we may not be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions or continue with selected acquisitions 
a substantial portion of our future cash flow will be devoted to debt service and lease payments 
in the past  we have frequently been dependent on third party financing and disposition of assets to fund these obligations in full and we may be required to do so in the future 
in addition  we are periodically required to refinance these obligations as they mature 
as a consequence of acquisitions of communities  we have substantially increased our leverage in our long term debt has decreased from million at december   to million at december   but  our obligations under long term leases  both capital and operating  have increased from million to  million 
these circumstances reduce our flexibility and ability to respond to our business needs  including changing business and financial conditions such as increasing interest rates and opportunities to expand our business through selected acquisitions 
we may be unable to increase or stabilize our occupancy rates that would result in positive earnings 
in previous years  we have been unable to increase our occupancy to levels that would result in net income on a sustained basis 
our historical losses have resulted  in part  from occupancy levels that were lower than anticipated when we acquired or developed our communities 
while our occupancy levels increased in  during the last three years prior to that  occupancy levels declined  although occupancy was nearly flat  excluding the effects of acquired communities 
we cannot guarantee that our occupancy levels will increase 
we will occasionally seek additional funding through public or private financing  including equity financing 
we may not find adequate equity  debt  or sale leaseback financing when we need it or on terms acceptable to us 
this could affect our ability to finance our operations or refinance our properties to avoid the consequences of default and foreclosure under our existing financing as described above 
in addition  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our shareholders may experience dilution of their investment 
if we fail to comply with financial covenants contained in our debt instruments  our lenders may accelerate the related debt 
from time to time  we failed to comply with certain covenants in our financing agreements 
in the future  we may not be able to comply with these covenants  which generally relate to matters such as cash flow  debt coverage ratios  and certain subjective performance standards 
if we fail to comply with any of these requirements and are not able to obtain waivers  our lenders could accelerate the related indebtedness so that it becomes due and payable prior to its stated due date 
we may be unable to pay or refinance this debt if it becomes due 
our liability insurance may be insufficient to cover the liabilities we face 
in recent years  participants in the long term care industry have faced an increasing number of lawsuits alleging negligence  malpractice  or other related legal theories 
many of these suits involve large claims and significant legal costs 
we expect we occasionally will face such suits because of the nature of our business 
for general liability and professional liability insurance for  we formed a wholly owned captive insurance company domiciled in the u 
s  which provides general and professional liability on a claims made basis 
because we are responsible for a self insured retention  funding losses up to the captive limits through premiums or paid in capital and losses in excess of the captive limits  we are ultimately responsible for the full loss of professional and general liability claims 
claims against us  regardless of their merit or eventual outcome  may also undermine our ability to attract residents or expand our business and would require management to devote time to matters unrelated to the operation of our business 
we currently do not carry general and professional liability insurance other than through our captive insurance subsidiary and although we review our liability insurance annually  we may not be able to obtain third party liability insurance coverage in the future or  if available  on acceptable terms 
during the past several years  retained losses relating to high self insured retention and annual premiums have increased significantly  which have substantially increased our costs associated with insurance and claims defense 
in february  a san antonio  texas  jury found one of our assisted living communities negligent in the care of a resident 
the jury awarded a verdict against us in the amount of million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages 
the verdict was in connection with an action that alleged negligence brought by the relatives of a resident at one of our assisted living facilities 
we are immediately appealing the verdict 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents we face risks associated with selective acquisitions 
we intend to continue to seek selective acquisition opportunities 
however  we may not succeed in identifying any future acquisition opportunities or completing any identified acquisitions 
the acquisition of communities presents a number of risks 
existing communities available for acquisition may frequently serve or target different market segments than those we presently serve 
it may be necessary in these cases to reposition and renovate acquired communities or turn over the existing resident population to achieve a resident care level and income profile that is consistent with our objectives 
in the past  these obstacles have delayed the achievement of acceptable occupancy levels and increased operating and capital expenditures 
as a consequence  we currently plan to target assisted living communities with established operations  which could reduce the number of acquisitions we can complete and increase the expected cost 
even in these acquisitions  however  we may need to make staff and operating management personnel changes to successfully integrate acquired communities into our existing operations 
we may not succeed in repositioning acquired communities or in effecting any necessary operational or structural changes and improvements on a timely basis 
we also may face unforeseen liabilities attributable to the prior operator of the acquired communities  against whom we may have little or no recourse 
we expect competition in our industry to increase  which could cause our occupancy rates and resident fees to decline 
the long term care industry is highly competitive  and given the relatively low barriers to entry and continuing health care cost containment pressures  we expect that our industry will become increasingly competitive in the future 
we believe that the industry is experiencing over capacity in several of our markets  thereby intensifying competition and adversely affecting occupancy levels and pricing 
we compete with other companies providing assisted living services as well as numerous other companies providing similar service and care alternatives  such as home healthcare agencies  independent living facilities  retirement communities  and skilled nursing facilities 
we expect that competition will increase from new market entrants  as assisted living residences receive increased market awareness and more states decide to include assisted living services in their medicaid programs 
many of these competitors may have substantially greater financial resources than we do 
increased competition may limit our ability to attract or retain residents or maintain our existing rate structures 
this could lead to lower occupancy rates or lower rate structures in our communities 
we also cannot predict the effect of the healthcare industry trend toward managed care on the assisted living marketplace 
managed care  an arrangement whereby service and care providers agree to sell specifically defined services to public or private payers in an effort to achieve more efficiency with respect to utilization and cost  is not currently a significant factor in the assisted living marketplace 
however  managed care plans sponsored by insurance companies or hmos may in the future affect pricing and the range of services provided in the assisted living marketplace 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents if development of new assisted living facilities outpaces demand  we may experience decreased occupancy  depressed margins  and diminished operating results 
we believe that some assisted living markets have become or are on the verge of becoming overbuilt 
the barriers to entry in the assisted living industry are not substantial 
consequently  the development of new assisted living facilities could outpace demand 
overbuilding in the markets in which we operate could thus cause us to experience decreased occupancy and depressed margins and could otherwise adversely affect our operating results 
market forces could undermine our efforts to attract seniors with sufficient resources 
we rely on our residents abilities to pay our fees from their own or familial financial resources 
generally  only seniors with income or assets meeting or exceeding the comparable median in the region where our assisted living communities are located can afford our fees 
inflation or other circumstances may undermine the ability of seniors to pay for our services 
if we encounter difficulty in attracting seniors with adequate resources to pay for our services  our occupancy rates may decline 
our labor costs may increase and may not be matched by corresponding increases in rates we charge to our residents 
we compete with other providers of assisted living services and long term care in attracting and retaining qualified and skilled personnel 
we depend on our ability to attract and retain management personnel responsible for the day to day operations of each of our communities 
if we are unable to attract or retain qualified communitiy management personnel  our results of operations may suffer 
in addition  possible shortages of nurses or trained personnel may require us to enhance our wage and benefits packages to compete in the hiring and retention of personnel 
we also depend on the available labor pool of semi skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate 
as a result of these and other factors  our labor costs may increase and may not be matched by corresponding increases in rates we charge to our residents 
we face possible environmental liabilities at each of our properties 
under various federal  state  and local environmental laws  ordinances  and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances  including asbestos containing materials that could be located on  in or under its property 
these laws and regulations often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances 
we could face substantial costs of any required remediation or removal of these substances  and our liability typically is not limited under applicable laws and regulations 
our liability could exceed our properties value or the value of our assets 
we may be unable to sell or rent our properties  or borrow using our properties as collateral  if any of these substances is present or if we fail to remediate them properly 
under these laws and regulations  if we arrange for the disposal of hazardous or toxic substances such as asbestos containing materials at a disposal site  we also may be liable for the costs of the removal or of the hazardous or toxic substances at the disposal site 
in addition to liability for these costs  we could be liable for governmental fines and injuries to persons or properties 
some of our facilities generate infectious medical waste due to the illness or physical condition of the residents  including  for example  blood soaked bandages  swabs  and other medical waste products  and incontinence products of those residents diagnosed with an infectious disease 
the management of infectious medical waste  including handling  storage  transportation  treatment  and disposal  is subject to regulation under various laws  including federal and state environmental laws 
these environmental laws set forth the management requirements  as well as permit  record keeping  notice  and reporting obligations 
each of our facilities has an agreement with a waste management company for the proper disposal of all infectious medical waste 
any finding that we are not in compliance with these environmental laws could adversely affect our business and financial condition 
because these environmental laws are amended from time to time  we cannot predict when and to what extent liability may arise 
in addition  because these environmental laws vary from state to state  expansion of our operations to states where we do not currently operate may subject us to additional restrictions on the manner in which we operate our facilities

baty and holiday 
mr 
baty s varying financial interests and responsibilities include the acquisition  financing  and refinancing of independent living facilities and the development and construction of  and capital raising activities to finance new facilities 
columbia pacific and affiliated partnerships operate assisted living communities and independent living facilities  many of which we manage under various management agreements 
the financial interests and management and financing responsibilities of mr 
baty with respect to holiday and columbia pacific and their affiliated partnerships could present conflicts of interest with us  including potential competition for residents in markets where both companies operate and competing demands for the time and efforts of mr 
baty 
because mr 
baty is both our chief executive officer as well as holiday s chairman of the board and is the principal owner of columbia pacific  circumstances could arise that would distract him from our operations 
our interests and those of holiday and columbia pacific interests may  on some occasions  be incompatible 
we have entered into a noncompetition agreement with mr 
baty  but this noncompetition agreement does not limit mr 
baty s current role with holiday or its related partnerships  so long as assisted living is only an incidental component of holiday s operation or management of independent living facilities 
we have entered into agreements with a number of entities that are owned or controlled by mr 
baty  whose interests with respect to these companies occasionally may conflict with ours 
we have entered into agreements  including most of our management agreements  with a number of entities that are owned or controlled by mr 
baty 
under these agreements  we provide management and other services to senior housing and assisted living communities owned by these entities and we have material agreements with these entities relating to the purchase  sale  and financing of a number of our operating communities 
there is a risk that the administration of these and any future arrangements could be adversely affected by these continuing relationships because our interests and those of mr 
baty may not be consistent at all times 
some of our recent transactions and the operations of certain communities that we manage are supported financially by mr 
baty with limited guarantees and through his direct and indirect ownership of such communities  we would be unable to benefit from these transactions and managed communities without this support 
the company has communities owned by entities controlled by mr 
baty which involve limited guarantees by mr 
baty and rely on his direct and indirect ownership of the communities involved 
as described in the fretus lease mr 
baty is guarantor of a portion of the debt and is the administrative member of fretus 
as described above under hcp transaction and in accordance with an amendment to the lease  effective july   mr 
baty unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed the payment when due of all costs  expense  fees  rents and other sums payable by us in the full  faithful and prompt performance when due 
the guaranty is limited to an aggregate amount of  the guaranty is still in place and mr 
baty has not been called upon for any payments 
the company has paid no consideration to mr 
baty for the guaranty 
as described under emeritrust i communities lease and in accordance with an amendment to the lease  effective september   mr 
baty personally guaranteed the prompt payment and performance of the lease obligations 
the guaranty is still in place and mr 
baty has not been called upon for any payments 
the company has paid mr 
baty consideration based upon the cash flow agreement as described above under the emeritrust i communities lease 
we believe that we would be unable to take advantage of these transactions and management opportunities without mr 
baty s individual and financial support 
the ongoing administration of these transactions  however  could be adversely affected by these continuing relationships because our interests and those of mr 
baty may not be consistent at all times 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that such support will be available in the future 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents we may be unable to attract and retain key management personnel 
we depend upon  and will continue to depend upon  the services of mr 
baty 
the loss of mr 
baty s services  in part or in whole  could adversely affect our business and our results of operations 
mr 
baty has financial interests and management responsibilities with respect to holiday and its related partnerships 
as a result  he does not devote his full time and efforts to emeritus 
we may be unable to attract and retain other qualified executive personnel critical to the success of our business 
our costs of compliance with government regulations may significantly increase in the future 
federal  state  and local authorities heavily regulate the healthcare industry 
regulations change frequently  and sometimes require us to make expensive changes in our operations 
a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to long term care are proposed or under study at both the federal and state levels that  if enacted or adopted  could adversely affect our business and operating results 
we cannot predict to what extent legislative or regulatory initiatives will be enacted or adopted or what effect any initiative would have on our business and operating results 
changes in applicable laws and new interpretations of existing laws can significantly affect our operations  as well as our revenues  particularly those from governmental sources  and our expenses 
our residential communities are subject to varying degrees of regulation and licensing by local and state health and social service agencies and other regulatory authorities 
while these regulations and licensing requirements often vary significantly from state to state  they typically address fire safety  sanitation  staff training  staffing patterns  living accommodations such as room size  number of bathrooms  and ventilation  and health related services 
we may be unable to satisfy all regulations and requirements or to acquire and maintain any required licenses on a cost effective basis 
in addition  with respect to our residents who receive financial assistance from governmental sources for their assisted living services  we are subject to federal and state regulations that prohibit certain business practices and relationships 
failure to comply with these regulations could prevent reimbursement for our healthcare services under medicaid or similar state reimbursement programs 
our failure to comply with such regulations also could result in fines and the suspension or inability to renew our operating licenses 
federal  state  and local governments occasionally conduct unannounced investigations  audits  and reviews to determine whether violations of applicable rules and regulations exist 
devoting management and staff time and legal resources to such investigations  as well as any material violation by us that is discovered in any such investigation  audit or review  could strain our resources and affect our profitability 
in addition  regulatory oversight of construction efforts associated with refurbishment could cause us to lose residents and disrupt community operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents our stock price has been highly volatile  and a number of factors may cause our common stock price to decline 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated and could fluctuate significantly in the future in response to various factors and events  including  but not limited to the liquidity of the market for our common stock  variations in our operating results  variations from analysts expectations  and new statutes or regulations  or changes in the interpretation of existing statutes or regulations  affecting the healthcare industry generally or the assisted living residence business in particular 
in addition  the stock market in recent years has experienced broad price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuations also may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
our share ownership and certain other factors may impede a proposed takeover of our business 
as of february   mr 
baty controls about of our outstanding common stock 
together  our directors and executive officers own  directly and indirectly  over of the voting power of our outstanding common and preferred stock 
accordingly  mr 
baty and the other members of our board and management would have significant influence over the outcome of matters submitted to our shareholders for a vote  including matters that would involve a change of control of emeritus 
further  our articles of incorporation require a two thirds supermajority vote to approve a business combination of emeritus with another company that is not approved by the board of directors 
accordingly  the current management group and board of directors could prevent approval of such a business combination 
we currently have a staggered board in which only one third of the board stands for election each year 
thus  absent removals and resignations  a complete change in board membership could not be accomplished in fewer than approximately two calendar years 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the table below provides information about our financial instruments entered into for purposes other than trading that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for our debt and capital lease and financing obligations  the table presents principal repayments in thousands of dollars and current weighted averages of interest rates on these obligations as of december  for our debt obligations with variable interest rates  the rate presented reflect the current rate in effect at the end of expected maturity date in thousands thereafter total fair value average interest rate long term debt fixed rate variable rate our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of our short term and long term borrowings 
we manage this risk by obtaining fixed rate borrowings when possible 
at december   our variable rate borrowings totaled approximately  currently  all our variable rate borrowings are based upon the prime rate 
additionally  we have certain operating lease obligations based on libor which are subject to a libor floor of 
as of december   the libor rates were above the floor 
if libor interest rates were to average more  our annual facility lease expense and net loss would increase by approximately million for the fretus lease 
this amount is determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our outstanding variable rate borrowings as of december   and does not consider changes in the actual level of borrowings that may occur subsequent to december  as libor rates continue to increase above the floor  we will be exposed to higher interest expense costs which manifest themselves in the form of additional lease expense 
this analysis also does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment  nor does it consider actions that management might be able to take with respect to our financial structure to mitigate the exposure to such a change
