item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations unless noted otherwise  the fiscal year ended january  is referred to as other fiscal years are referred to in a similar manner 
general overview bj s is a leading warehouse club operator in the eastern united states 
as of january   we operated bj s warehouse clubs  of which operate gasoline stations  and two profoods restaurant supply clubs  in states 
the success of our business is dependent on our ability to achieve high volumes of sales and rapid inventory turnover  to attract and retain members and to control costs 
we believe that our pricing and cost structure is a major competitive advantage for us 
our revenues are derived from the sale of a wide range of food and general merchandise items  the sale of gasoline and from membership fees 
paid membership is an essential component in our business 
it not only provides a source of revenue  but it promotes customer loyalty 
membership fees permit us to offer lower prices to our members  encouraging them to shop us more frequently 
member renewal rates are a key performance indicator for us 
comparable store sales performance is an important measure throughout the retail industry 
our comparable club sales increase from to was  including a contribution from gasoline of 
our comparable club sales performance improved significantly over the last two years 
from to  our comparable club sales increased by  including a contribution from gasoline sales of 
from to comparable club sales increased by  including a contribution from gasoline sales of our low merchandise margin rates drive the high sales volumes that are so critical in our business 
our merchandise margin rate is a key metric in achieving both our top line and bottom line objectives 
we believe that the cost structure built into our business model puts us among the most efficient in the retail industry 
we closely monitor our costs as a percentage of sales  particularly our payroll costs  which comprise the largest portion of our selling  general and administrative expenses 
we place a great deal of emphasis on control of our inventories 
because of our high sales volumes and inventory turns  we are able to generate cash from a large portion of our inventory before we are required to pay our merchandise vendors 
the majority of our inventory purchases are routed through our cross dock facilities  including two new state of the art facilities which were built in and we monitor several inventory related measures  including inventory turns  accounts payable as a percentage of inventories  average inventories per club and shrinkage as a percentage of sales 
overview of operations our strong operating results in reflect the progress we have made in the last two years in shifting our focus from a product centric to a member centric business model 
the key enabler for this model shift was our framework for analyzing and leveraging our membership data that we call member insight 
member insight drove the major re merchandising effort that we essentially completed in the first quarter of  in which we eliminated selected slower moving general merchandise categories and strengthened certain food categories  particularly faster selling fresh foods 
at the same time  we also improved product adjacencies to drive incremental sales 
the ultimate goal of re merchandising clubs is to better serve our members needs while driving margin expansion and shopping frequency 

table of contents as noted above  we have had strong comparable club sales gains in the last two years 
total sales in were higher than the previous year 
spurred by strong membership renewal rates and increased participation in bj s rewards membership program  membership fee revenues in improved by over the previous year 
aided by a significant increase in private brand sales  expansion of our fresh food departments and a shift from third party to direct purchase of produce that was completed in the third quarter  merchandise margins in improved over the previous year 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased slightly in  due in part to the transition to self run produce 
net income of million in exceeded our plan for the year 
as of january   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities of million versus million at the end of the previous year 
long term debt  including current installments was less than million as of january  by the end of the year we settled the last of the househome leases for which we were contingently liable 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  or million more than net cash provided by operating activities in critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis and make judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities based on a number of factors 
these factors include historical experience  guidance provided by outside experts and assumptions made by management that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this section summarizes critical accounting policies and the related judgments involved in their application 
cash consideration received from vendors we receive various types of cash consideration from vendors  principally in the form of rebates and allowances 
we recognize such vendor rebates and allowances as a reduction of cost of sales based on a systematic and rational allocation of the cash consideration offered to the underlying transaction that results in progress by bj s toward earning the rebates and allowances  provided the amounts to be earned are probable and reasonably estimable 
otherwise  rebates and allowances are recognized only when predetermined milestones are met 
we review the status of all rebates and allowances at least once per quarter and update our estimates  if necessary at that time 
we believe that our review process has allowed us to avoid material adjustments in estimates of vendor rebates and allowances 
legal contingencies as described in more detail in note f to the consolidated financial statements  bj s is subject to various claims relating to fraudulent credit and debit card charges  the cost of replacing cards and related monitoring expenses and other related claims 
as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies  sfas no 
we accrue a liability if the potential loss for a claim is considered probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether our exposure can be reasonably estimated 
in reviewing the reserve relating to the credit card matter  we make significant estimates regarding the claims that have been made for fraudulent credit and debit card charges and the cost of replacing cards  monitoring expenses  and related fees and expenses 
because of uncertainties related to this matter  accruals are based on information available at the time our financial statements are issued 
periodically  and as additional information becomes available  we will reassess the potential liability and may revise our estimates and adjust our reserve 

table of contents inventories merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined under the average cost method  or market 
we recognize the write down of slow moving or obsolete inventory in cost of sales when such write downs are probable and estimable 
records are maintained at the stockkeeping unit sku level 
a report that details the number of weeks of selling supply for each sku allows our merchandising staff to make timely markdown decisions to help maintain rapid inventory turnover  which is essential in our business 
the carrying value of any sku whose selling price is marked down to below cost is immediately reduced to that selling price 
we take physical inventories of merchandise on a cycle basis at every location each year 
a second physical inventory is taken at the end of the year at selected locations 
we estimate a reserve for inventory shrinkage for the period between physical inventories 
this estimate is based on historical results of previous physical inventories  shrinkage trends or other judgments management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
long lived assets we review the realizability of our long lived assets annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
current and expected operating results and cash flows and other factors are considered in connection with our reviews 
significant judgments are made in projecting future cash flows and are based on a number of factors  including the maturity level of the club  historical experience of clubs with similar characteristics  recent trends and general economic assumptions 
impairment losses are measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the impaired assets 
deferred taxes as of january   we had not established a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets because those assets can be realized by offsetting deferred tax liabilities and future taxable income  which management believes will more likely than not be earned  based on our historical record and projected earnings 
significant changes in projections of future taxable income could result in our establishment of a valuation allowance  which would reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets 
reserves for closed store lease obligations during the fiscal year ended february   we established reserves for our liability related to househome  inc househome leases 
pursuant to an agreement with the tjx companies  inc tjx  we agreed to indemnify tjx for of househome s lease liabilities guaranteed by tjx through january  and for of any such liabilities thereafter 
househome filed for bankruptcy in november see note c of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our recorded liabilities were based on the present value of rent liabilities under the househome leases  including estimated real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges  reduced by estimated income from the subleasing of these properties 
an annual discount rate of was used to calculate the present value of these lease obligations 
this rate was based on estimated incremental borrowing rates for the company during the weighted average period of time over which these obligations were expected to be paid 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of our househome reserves based on progress made in settling our obligations and the status of ongoing negotiations and made appropriate adjustments to the reserves as a result of our evaluations 
as of january   all househome leases for which we were contingently liable have been settled  including lump sum settlements for leases 
the other three househome properties for which we remain contingently liable have been assigned to third parties 
during the fiscal year ended february   we established reserves for our lease liabilities for three bj s clubs which were closed in november two of these clubs were in the columbus  ohio  market and one was in north dade  florida 
see note c of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our recorded liabilities have been based on the present value of rent liabilities under these leases  
table of contents including estimated real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges  reduced by estimated income from the subleasing of these properties 
an annual discount rate of was used to calculate the present value of these lease obligations 
this rate was based on the estimated incremental borrowing rate for the company during the weighted average period of time over which these obligations are expected to be paid 
a considerable amount of judgment was involved in determining our net liability related to the closed club leases  particularly in estimating potential sublease income 
based on our knowledge of real estate conditions in the local markets and our experience in those markets  we assumed an average period of time it would take to sublease the properties and the amount of potential sublease income for each property 
net payments that we make to settle our lease obligations will reduce operating cash flows in varying amounts over the remaining terms of the leases  which expire at various times up to during  we made a lump sum payment to settle the lease for one of the three closed clubs 
based on this settlement and an evaluation of the status of the two remaining properties  we adjusted our reserve for closed clubs 
the reserve at january  includes an estimated amount to settle the lease for one of the two remaining clubs through a lump sum payment based on negotiations in progress 
the remainder of the reserve is based on the present value of our rent liability under the lease for the other remaining club  including real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges  reduced by estimated income from subleasing the property 
we will continue to use an annual discount rate of to calculate the present value of the obligation 
self insurance reserves we are primarily self insured for worker s compensation and general liability claims 
reported reserves for these claims are derived from estimated ultimate costs based upon individual claim file reserves and estimates for incurred but not reported claims 
estimates are based on valuations provided by third party actuaries  historical loss development factors  and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances

revised  share based payment  sfas r revises fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
this statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  and focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
we currently account for stock based employee compensation under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
in accordance with that standard  no stock based employee compensation cost for stock options has been reflected in our statements of income 
in accordance with the provisions of the original sfas no 
 we currently disclose  on a pro forma basis  the effect on net income had we applied the provisions of that statement to stock based employee compensation 

table of contents sfas no 
r will require us to recognize stock option expense in our statements of income beginning no later than the third fiscal quarter of and to estimate the effect of stock option forfeitures 
as permitted by the original sfas no 
 we currently account for forfeitures as they occur 
in addition  sfas r amends fasb statement no 
 statements of cash flows  to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid 
as of the beginning of our third fiscal quarter in the required effective date  we will apply the provisions of sfas r to new stock awards and to awards modified  repurchased or canceled after the required effective date 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding as of the required effective date shall be recognized as the service is rendered on or after that date 
the compensation cost for that portion of awards will be based on the fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under the original sfas no 
under sfas r  we may apply a modified version of retrospective application either a to all prior years for which the original sfas no 
was effective  or b only to our first two fiscal quarters 
we have not yet decided whether we will use modified retrospective application when we adopt sfas r 
if we do so  we estimate that our post tax stock option expense for the full year will be approximately to million 
actual amounts of stock option expense may vary materially from this estimate based on a number of factors  including the number and timing of new options granted  the fair market value of the company s stock price on the date of grant and assumptions to be applied in determining the fair value of options on the grant date

four of the new clubs opened in were at owned locations 
we also opened a new  square foot owned cross dock facility in jacksonville  florida  in april and remodeled existing clubs during the year 
we expect that capital expenditures will total approximately to million in  based on plans to open to new clubs and approximately gas stations 
we also expect to remodel approximately four existing clubs in planned capital expenditures in include approximately million associated with the relocation of our franklin  massachusetts  cross dock facility to a new facility in uxbridge  massachusetts  which we plan to open in the timing of actual openings and the amount of related expenditures could vary from the estimates above due  among other things  to the complexity of the real estate development process

as of january   our remaining repurchase authorization was million 
on february   the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional million of bj s common stock 
in january  we assumed a real estate mortgage with a principal balance of  in connection with the purchase of a club that was previously leased 
this debt carries an interest rate of  is payable in monthly installments maturing through november  and has a prepayment penalty 
the principal balance at january  was million 
we have a million unsecured credit agreement with a group of banks which expires june  the agreement includes a million sub facility for letters of credit  of which million was outstanding at january  we are required to pay an annual facility fee which is currently of the total commitment 
interest on borrowings is payable at bj s option either at a the eurodollar rate plus a margin which is currently or b a rate equal to the higher of the sum of the federal funds effective rate plus or the agent bank s prime rate 
we are also required to pay a usage fee in any calendar quarter during which the average daily amount of loans and undrawn or unreimbursed letters of credit outstanding exceeds of the total commitment

we are required to comply with these covenants on a quarterly basis 
under the credit agreement  we may pay dividends or repurchase our own stock in any amount so long as we remain in compliance with all other covenants 
we have no credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity date of debt if borrowings were outstanding under our credit agreement 
we were in compliance with the covenants and other requirements set forth in our credit agreement at january  and for all fiscal periods throughout the year 
we expect to enter into a new credit agreement before the current agreement expires 
in addition to the credit agreement  we maintain a separate million facility for letters of credit  primarily to support the purchase of inventories  of which million was outstanding at january   and we also maintain a million uncommitted credit line for short term borrowings which expires on september  there were no borrowings outstanding under our bank credit agreement or our uncommitted credit line at january  and january  increases in inventories and accounts payable from january  to january  were due mainly to the addition of new clubs and an increase of in the average inventory per club in the same time period 
pursuant to an agreement with tjx and in connection with househome s filing for bankruptcy on november   we recorded a pretax charge of million for our estimated loss associated with househome leases in based on our continuing evaluation of our remaining obligations and the significant progress made in settling liabilities for househome leases  we recorded pretax gains of million in  million in and million in to reduce our estimated liability related to househome contingent lease obligations 
as of january   we have settled all househome leases for which we were originally contingently liable  including lump sum settlements for leases 
the other three househome properties for which we remain contingently liable have been assigned to third parties 

table of contents during the third quarter of  we established reserves for our liability related to leases for three bj s clubs which closed on november  see note c of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our recorded liabilities have been based on the present value of rent liabilities under the three leases  including estimated real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges  reduced by estimated income from the subleasing of these properties 
an annual discount rate of was used to calculate the present value of these lease obligations 
this rate was based on estimated borrowing rates for the company that took into consideration the weighted average period of time over which these obligations are expected to be paid 
during  we made a lump sum payment to settle the lease for one of the three closed clubs 
based on this settlement and an evaluation of the status of the two remaining properties  we recorded a pretax charge of million to increase our reserve for closed clubs 
the reserve at january  includes an estimated amount to settle the lease for one of the two remaining clubs through a lump sum payment based on negotiations in progress 
the remainder of the reserve is based on the present value of our rent liability under the lease for the other remaining club  including real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges  reduced by estimated income from subleasing the property 
we will continue to use an annual discount rate of to calculate the present value of the obligation 
we believe that the liabilities recorded in the financial statements adequately provide for these lease obligations 
however  there can be no assurance that our actual liability for closed store obligations will not differ materially from amounts recorded in the financial statements due to a number of factors  including future economic factors which may affect the ability to successfully sublease  assign or otherwise settle liabilities related to these properties 
we consider our maximum reasonably possible undiscounted pretax exposure for our closed store lease obligations to be approximately million at january  bj s has filed proofs of claim against househome  inc for claims arising under certain agreements between bj s and househome in connection with the company s spin off from waban inc in july these claims arise primarily from bj s indemnification of tjx with respect to tjx s guarantee of househome leases and from the tax sharing agreement dated july  between bj s and househome 
househome and bj s have settled bj s claims against househome 
the settlement provides that bj s will have an unsecured claim of approximately million  on account of claims under the tax sharing agreement and indemnification payments which have been made to tjx 
the settlement agreement was approved by the united states bankruptcy court for the central district of california on november  as part of the settlement  bj s has been released of all claims that househome and its bankruptcy estate may have had against bj s  including million owed by bj s to househome under the tax sharing agreement 
we recognized this amount as a reduction in our tax provision in the fourth quarter of during  we received pretax recoveries on account of our househome bankruptcy claims totaling million  including a payment of million to settle our claim against the indenture trustee for househome s convertible subordinated notes 
we have no further claims against the indenture trustee 
these recoveries are included in gain on contingent lease obligations in the statements of income 
on a post tax basis these gains totaled million 
we are unable to determine the amount and timing of any future recoveries under our claims against househome and  therefore  have not recognized such claims against househome in our financial statements 
early in we were notified by credit card issuers that credit and debit card accounts used legitimately at bj s were subsequently used in fraudulent transactions at non bj s locations 
in response  we retained a leading computer security firm to conduct a forensic analysis of our information technology systems with a goal of determining whether a breach had in fact occurred 
while no conclusive evidence of a breach was found  the computer security firm concluded that our centralized computer system that serves as the aggregation point for all bj s credit and debit card transactions chain wide had not been breached and any breach would have likely occurred in a more decentralized fashion involving club level systems 
on march   after our receipt of the computer security firm s preliminary report of findings  we issued a public statement alerting consumers to the potential security breach 

table of contents in  we recorded pretax charges of million million post tax to establish a reserve for claims seeking reimbursement for fraudulent credit and debit card charges and the cost of replacing cards  monitoring expenses and related fees and expenses

in connection with the spin off in  waban received a letter ruling from the internal revenue service to the effect that  for federal income tax purposes  the distribution of the company s stock to waban s stockholders the distribution and related asset transfers would be tax free to waban s stockholders 
certain future events not within the control of the company or househome  including  for example  certain dispositions of the company s common stock or househome s common stock  could cause the distribution not to qualify for tax free treatment 
if this occurred  the related tax liability would be payable by househome  although the company has agreed to indemnify househome under certain circumstances for all or a portion of such tax liability

there were no borrowings outstanding under our bank credit agreement or its uncommitted credit line at january  we have not used derivative financial instruments
