the market for life insurance  retirement and investment products continues to be highly fragmented and competitive 
as of december   there were approximately groups of life insurance companies in the united states  most of which offered one or more similar products 
based on information contained in statements filed with state insurance departments  as of december   the allstate financial segment ranked th based on ordinary life insurance in force and th based on statutory admitted assets 
in addition  because many of these products include a savings or investment component  our competition includes domestic and foreign securities firms  investment advisors  mutual funds  banks and other financial institutions 
competitive pressure is growing due to several factors  including cross marketing alliances between unaffiliated businesses  as well as consolidation activity in the financial services industry

reserve for property liability claims and claims expense the following information regarding reserves applies to all of our property liability operations  encompassing both the allstate protection segment and the discontinued lines and coverages segment 
reconciliation of claims reserves the following tables are summary reconciliations of the beginning and ending property liability insurance claims and claims expense reserves  displayed individually for each of the last three years 
the first table presents reserves on a gross before reinsurance basis 
the end of year gross reserve balances are reflected in the consolidated statements of financial position 
the second table presents reserves on a net after reinsurance basis 
the total net property liability insurance claims and claims expense amounts are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations

the year end gross reserves of billion for property liability insurance claims and claims expense  as determined under gaap  were billion more than the net reserve balance of billion recorded on the basis of statutory accounting practices for reports provided to state regulatory authorities 
the principal differences are reinsurance recoverables from third parties totaling billion that reduce reserves for statutory reporting and are recorded as assets for gaap reporting  and a liability for the reserves of the canadian subsidiaries for million 
remaining differences are due to variations in requirements between gaap  and statutory reporting 
as the tables above illustrate  allstate s net reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of decreased in by million  compared to reestimates of the gross reserves of an increase of million 
net reserve reestimates in  and were lower than the gross reserve reestimates due to reinsurance cessions on gross reserve reestimates 
loss reserve reestimates the following loss reserve reestimates table illustrates the change over time of the net reserves established for property liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of the last eleven calendar years 
the first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year 
the second section  reading down  shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to that reserve liability 
the third section  reading down  shows retroactive reestimates of the original recorded reserve as of the end of each successive year which is the result of allstate s expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims 
the last section compares the latest reestimated reserve to the reserve originally established  and indicates whether the original reserve was adequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims 
the table also presents the gross reestimated liability as of the end of the latest reestimation period  with separate disclosure of the related reestimated reinsurance recoverable 
the loss reserve reestimates table is cumulative and  therefore  ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years

the decrease in net reserves established for december  reflects favorable reestimates as more fully discussed below 
the following table is derived from the loss reserve reestimates table and summarizes the effect of reserve reestimates  net of reinsurance  on calendar year operations for the ten year period ended december  the total of each column details the amount of reserve reestimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which the reestimates are applicable 
the amounts in the total accident year column on the far right represent the cumulative reserve reestimates for the indicated accident year s 
effect of net reserve reestimates on calendar year operations in millions total by accident year prior total favorable calendar year reserve reestimates in through were the result of favorable severity trends in each of the six years for allstate protection  which more than offset adverse reestimates in the discontinued lines and coverages segment  primarily for asbestos and environmental liabilities  virtually all of which relates to and prior years 
the favorable severity trend during this period was primarily the result of favorable injury severity trends  as compared to our anticipated trends 
favorable injury severity trends were largely due to more moderate medical cost inflation and the mitigating effects of our loss management programs 
the impacts of more moderate medical cost inflation have emerged over time as actual claim settlements validate its magnitude 
beginning in the early s  lower medical cost inflation rates  as evidenced by the consumer price index cpi published by the bureau of labor statistics for medical costs  have contributed to lower actual claim settlements than prior estimates 
from through  the medical cpi averaged  and from through  the average declined to 
the medical cpi is considered a viable indicator of the direction of claim costs because it is a measure of the change in various costs for medical services and supplies  including doctors fees  emergency care  therapy and rehabilitation  and pharmaceuticals  all of which are covered claims for insureds 
in  the medical cpi increased to  and most recent economic forecasts anticipate further increases in medical inflation 
if this occurs  future reserve reestimates could be adversely impacted if actual results exceed reserve estimates 
our loss management programs over time have had a mitigating effect in a variety of aspects on injury severity trends 
we have been improving the claim adjudication processes by implementing programs to accomplish better investigation of claims  consistent handling of soft tissue injury claims  more accurate valuation of damages  and more effective negotiation and defense practices 
these improvements have also involved hiring additional staff  providing increased training  creating specialized units of expert employees to handle specific types of claims  and focusing attention and resources on handling specific types of claims such as soft tissue injury claims  claims with attorney involvement  and claims in litigation 
these programs were intended to create an improved culture  focused on expert  efficient  and effective claim process management 
since  growth of allstate s injury claim costs has compared favorably to published insurance industry competitor results 
we believe this experience is substantially due to the claim adjudication process improvements  and is an additional factor contributing to reductions in reserve estimates 
while changes to the claim settlement process have mitigated increases in severity trends on closed claims  these changes can impact historical patterns of losses  introducing a greater degree of statistical variability in actuarial reserve estimates for the remaining outstanding claims 
in  we decreased our reserve estimates for prior years 
favorable reserve estimates were primarily due to allstate protection auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was less than what was anticipated in previous reserve estimates 
decreased reserve reestimates for allstate protection more than offset increased estimates of losses primarily related to asbestos and environmental liabilities in the discontinued lines and coverages segment 
in and  we increased our reserve estimates for prior years 
unfavorable reserve reestimates in  were due to favorable allstate protection auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was better than previous estimates  offset by unfavorable increases primarily related to asbestos and other discontinued lines 
unfavorable reserve reestimates in were due to claim severity and late reported losses for allstate protection that were greater than what was anticipated in previous reserve estimates and to increased estimates of losses primarily related to asbestos and environmental liabilities in the discontinued lines and coverages segment 
in  we increased our reserve estimates for prior years due to greater volume of late reported weather related losses than expected from the end of the year which were reported in the year  additional incurred losses on the northridge earthquake  adverse results of class action and other litigation  upward reestimates of property losses and upward reestimates of losses in the encompass and canadian businesses for additional information regarding reserves  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations property liability claims and claims expense reserves 
regulation allstate is subject to extensive regulation  primarily at the state level 
the method  extent and substance of such regulation varies by state but generally has its source in statutes that establish standards and requirements for conducting the business of insurance and that delegate regulatory authority to a state regulatory agency 
in general  such regulation is intended for the protection of those who purchase or use insurance products issued by our subsidiaries  not the holders of securities issued by the allstate corporation 
these rules have a substantial effect on our business and relate to a wide variety of matters including insurance company licensing and examination  agent and adjuster licensing  price setting  trade practices  policy forms  accounting methods  the nature and amount of investments  claims practices  participation in shared markets and guaranty funds  reserve adequacy  insurer solvency  transactions with affiliates  the payment of dividends  and underwriting standards 
some of these matters are discussed in more detail below 
for a discussion of statutory financial information  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
for a discussion of regulatory contingencies  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
notes and are incorporated in this part i  item by reference 
in recent years the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny 
legislation that would provide for federal chartering of insurance companies has been proposed 
in addition  state legislators and insurance regulators continue to examine the appropriate nature and scope of state insurance regulation 
we cannot predict whether any specific state or federal measures will be adopted to change the nature or scope of the regulation of the insurance business or what effect any such measures would have on allstate 
catastrophe exposure management 
allstate continues to evaluate its exposure to catastrophes and our countrywide catastrophe risk management strategies for hurricanes and earthquakes 
following the hurricane season  the state of florida has taken actions that could negatively impact our level of homeowners premiums written and our profitability  including changing to seasonal hurricane deductibles  discouraging insurance companies from increasing rates and not allowing non renewal of policies 
separately  we are advancing proposals for legislative reform in florida 
we cannot predict what will emerge from the legislative process 
agent and broker compensation 
a number of states are considering new legislation or regulations regarding the compensation of agents and brokers by insurance companies 
the rules that would be imposed if these proposals were adopted range in nature from disclosure requirements to rules that would impose new duties on insurance agents and brokers in dealing with customers 
because these proposals are in the early stages of development  we cannot predict their potential impact on our business 
limitations on dividends by insurance subsidiaries 
as a holding company with no significant business operations of its own  the allstate corporation relies on dividends from allstate insurance company as one of the principal sources of cash to pay dividends and to meet its obligations  including the payment of principal and interest on debt 
allstate insurance company is regulated as an insurance company in illinois and its ability to pay dividends is restricted by illinois law 
for additional information regarding those restrictions  see part ii  item of this report 
the laws of the other jurisdictions that generally govern our insurance subsidiaries contain similar limitations on the payment of dividends and in some jurisdictions the laws may be more restrictive 
holding company regulation 
the allstate corporation and allstate insurance company are insurance holding companies subject to regulation throughout the jurisdictions in which their insurance subsidiaries do business 
in the us  these subsidiaries are organized under the insurance codes of california  florida  illinois  nebraska  new hampshire  new york  pennsylvania and texas 
generally  the insurance codes in these states provide that the acquisition or change of control of a domestic insurer or of any person that controls a domestic insurer cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the relevant insurance regulator 
in general  a presumption of control arises from the ownership  control  possession with the power to vote  or possession of proxies with respect to  ten percent or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurer or of a person that controls a domestic insurer 
in addition  certain state insurance laws require pre acquisition notification to state agencies of a change in control with respect to a non domestic insurance company licensed to do business in that state 
while such pre acquisition notification statutes do not authorize the state agency to disapprove the change of control  such statutes do authorize certain remedies  including the issuance of a cease and desist order with respect to the non domestic insurer if certain conditions exist  such as undue market concentration 
thus  any transaction involving the acquisition of ten percent or more of the allstate corporation s common stock would generally require prior approval by the state insurance departments in california  illinois  nebraska  new hampshire  new york  pennsylvania and texas 
the prior approval of the florida insurance department would be necessary for the acquisition of five percent or more 
moreover  notification would be required in those other states that have adopted pre acquisition notification provisions and where the insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business 
such approval requirements may deter  delay or prevent certain transactions affecting the ownership of the allstate corporation s common stock 
price regulation 
nearly all states have insurance laws requiring personal property and casualty insurers to file price schedules  policy or coverage forms  and other information with the state s regulatory authority 
in many cases  such price schedules  policy forms or both must be approved prior to use 
while they vary from state to state  the objectives of the pricing laws are generally the same a price cannot be excessive  inadequate or unfairly discriminatory 
the speed with which an insurer can change prices in response to competition or in response to increasing costs depends  in part  on whether the pricing laws are i prior approval  ii file and use  or iii use and file laws 
in states having prior approval laws  the regulator must approve a price before the insurer may use it 
in states having file and use laws  the insurer does not have to wait for the regulator s approval to use a price  but the price must be filed with the regulatory authority prior to being used 
a use and file law requires an insurer to file prices within a certain period of time after the insurer begins using them 
approximately one half of the states  including california and new york  have prior approval laws 
under all three types of pricing laws  the regulator has the authority to disapprove a price subsequent to its filing 
an insurer s ability to adjust its prices in response to competition or to increasing costs is often dependent on an insurer s ability to demonstrate to the regulator that its pricing or proposed pricing meets the requirements of the pricing laws 
in those states that significantly restrict an insurer s discretion in selecting the business that it wants to underwrite  an insurer can manage its risk of loss by charging a price that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance 
in those states that significantly restrict an insurer s ability to charge a price that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance  the insurer can manage its risk of loss by being more selective in the type of business it underwrites 
when a state significantly restricts both underwriting and pricing  it becomes more difficult for an insurer to maintain its profitability 
changes in allstate s claim settlement process may require allstate to actuarially adjust loss information used in its pricing process 
some state insurance regulatory authorities may not approve price increases that give full effect to these adjustments 
from time to time  the private passenger auto insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators  legislators and special interest groups to reduce  freeze or set prices at levels that do not correspond with our analysis of underlying costs and expenses 
homeowners insurance comes under similar pressure  particularly as regulators in states subject to high levels of catastrophe losses struggle to identify an acceptable methodology to price for catastrophe exposure 
we expect this kind of pressure to persist 
in addition  our use of insurance scoring based on credit report information for underwriting and pricing regularly comes under attack by regulators  legislators and special interest groups in various states 
the result could be legislation or regulation that adversely affects the profitability of the allstate protection segment 
we cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative and regulatory measures regarding pricing 
involuntary markets 
as a condition of maintaining our licenses to write personal property and casualty insurance in various states  we are required to participate in assigned risk plans  reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations that provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers 
underwriting results related to these arrangements  which tend to be adverse  have been immaterial to our results of operations 
guaranty funds 
under state insurance guaranty fund laws  insurers doing business in a state can be assessed  up to prescribed limits  in order to cover certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies 
investment regulation 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that require investment portfolio diversification and that limit the amount of investment in certain categories 
failure to comply with these rules leads to the treatment of non conforming investments as non admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus 
further  in some instances  these rules require divestiture of non conforming investments 
as of december  the investment portfolios of our insurance subsidiaries complied with such laws and regulations in all material respects 
exiting geographic markets  canceling and non renewing policies 
most states regulate an insurer s ability to exit a market 
for example  some states limit a private passenger auto insurer s ability to cancel and non renew policies 
some states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more types of insurance business from the state  except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department and not disapproved on the grounds that it could lead to market disruption 
regulations that limit cancellation and non renewal and that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer s ability to exit unprofitable markets 
variable life insurance  variable annuities and registered fixed annuities 
the sale of variable life insurance  variable annuities and registered fixed annuities with market value adjustment features are subject to extensive regulatory oversight at the federal and state level  including regulation and supervision by the securities and exchange commission and the national association of securities dealers 
broker dealers  investment advisors and investment companies 
the allstate entities that operate as broker dealers  registered investment advisors and investment companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the securities and exchange commission  the national association of securities dealers and or  in some cases  state securities administrators 
regulation and legislation affecting consolidation in the financial services industry 
the gramm leach bliley act of permits mergers that combine commercial banks  insurers and securities firms within one holding company group 
in addition  it allows grandfathered unitary thrift holding companies  including our parent company  to engage in activities that are not financial in nature 
the ability of banks to affiliate with insurers may materially adversely affect our business by substantially increasing the number  size and financial strength of potential competitors 
banking 
the allstate corporation is a diversified savings and loan holding company for allstate bank  a federal stock savings bank and a member of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
the principal supervisory authority for the diversified savings and loan holding company activities and the bank is the office of thrift supervision 
the bank is also subject to the authority of the fdic and other federal financial regulators implementing various laws applicable to banking 
privacy regulation 
federal law and the laws of some states require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of customer information and to notify customers about their policies and practices relating to collection and disclosure of customer information and their policies relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information 
federal law and the laws of some states also regulate disclosures of customer information 
congress  state legislatures and regulatory authorities are expected to consider additional regulation relating to privacy and other aspects of customer information 
asbestos 
recently  president bush announced his support of efforts to pass meaningful federal reform to address asbestos claims and litigation 
congress has considered such legislation in the past  but unified support among various defendant and insurer groups considered essential to any possible reform has been lacking 
we cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative measures regarding asbestos 
environmental 
environmental pollution clean up of polluted waste sites is the subject of both federal and state regulation 
the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of superfund and comparable state statutes mini superfund govern the clean up and restoration of waste sites by potentially responsible parties prps 
superfund and the mini superfunds environmental clean up laws or ecls establish a mechanism to pay for clean up of waste sites if prps fail to do so and to assign liability to prps 
the extent of liability to be allocated to a prp is dependent on a variety of factors 
by some estimates  there are thousands of potential waste sites subject to clean up  but the exact number is unknown 
the extent of clean up necessary and the process of assigning liability remain in dispute 
the insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation regarding coverage issues arising out of the clean up of waste sites by insured prps and insured parties alleged liability to third parties responsible for the clean up 
the insurance industry  including allstate  is disputing many such claims 
key coverage issues include whether superfund response  investigation and clean up costs are considered damages under the policies  trigger of coverage  applicability of several types of pollution exclusions  proper notice of claims  whether administrative liability triggers the duty to defend  appropriate allocation of liability among triggered insurers  and whether the liability in question falls within the definition of an occurrence 
identical coverage issues exist for clean up and waste sites not covered under superfund 
to date  courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues 
allstate s exposure to liability with regard to its insureds that have been  or may be  named as prps is uncertain 
comprehensive superfund reform proposals have been introduced in congress  but only modest reform measures have been enacted

we use operating ratios to measure the profitability of our property liability results 
we believe that they enhance an investor s understanding of our profitability 
they are calculated as follows claims and claims expense loss ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned 
loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses  expense ratio the ratio of amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned  combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense  amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
the difference between and the combined ratio represents underwriting income as a percentage of premiums earned

it is reasonably likely that changes in these assumptions and estimates could occur from period to period and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
a brief summary of each of these critical accounting policies follows 
for a more complete discussion of the effect of these policies on our consolidated financial statements  and the judgments and estimates relating to these policies  see the referenced sections of the md a 
for a complete summary of our significant accounting policies see note of the consolidated financial statements 
investment valuation the fair value of publicly traded fixed income and equity securities is based on independent market quotations  whereas the fair value of non publicly traded securities is based on either widely accepted pricing valuation models which use internally developed ratings and independent third party data as inputs or independent third party pricing sources 
factors used in our internally developed models  such as liquidity risk associated with privately placed securities  are difficult to independently observe and to quantify 
because of this  judgment is required in developing certain of these estimates and  as a result  the estimated fair value of non publicly traded securities may differ from amounts that would be realized upon an immediate sale of the securities 
periodic changes in fair values of investments classified as available for sale are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated statements of financial position and are not reflected in the operating results of any period until reclassified to net income upon the consummation of a transaction with an unrelated third party  or when declines in fair values are deemed other than temporary 
the assessment of other than temporary impairment of a security s fair value is performed on a case by case basis considering a wide range of factors 
there are a number of assumptions and estimates inherent in assessing impairments and determining if they are other than temporary  including our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value  the expected recoverability of principal and interest  the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost for equity securities or amortized cost for fixed income securities  the financial condition  near term and long term prospects of the issuer  including relevant industry conditions and trends  and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices  and the specific reasons that a security is in a significant unrealized loss position  including market conditions which could affect liquidity 
additionally  once assumptions and estimates are made  any number of changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to later determine that an impairment is other than temporary  including general economic conditions that are worse than previously assumed or that have a greater adverse effect on a particular issuer than originally estimated  changes in the facts and circumstances related to a particular issuer s ability to meet all of its contractual obligations  and changes in facts and circumstances or new information that we obtain which causes a change in our ability or intent to hold a security to maturity or until it recovers in value 
changes in assumptions  facts and circumstances could result in additional charges to earnings in future periods to the extent that losses are realized 
the charge to earnings  while potentially significant to net income  would not have a significant effect on shareholders equity since the majority of our portfolio is held at fair value and as a result  any related unrealized loss  net of deferred acquisition costs  deferred sales inducement costs and tax  would already be reflected as accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity

derivative instrument hedge effectiveness in the normal course of business  we primarily use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risk and in conjunction with asset liability management  particularly in the allstate financial segment 
the fair value of exchange traded derivative contracts is based on independent market quotations  whereas the fair value of non exchange traded derivative contracts is based on either widely accepted pricing valuation models which use independent third party data as inputs or independent third party pricing sources 
when derivatives meet specific criteria  they may be designated as accounting hedges and accounted for as fair value  cash flow  foreign currency fair value  or foreign currency cash flow hedges 
when designating a derivative as an accounting hedge  we formally document the hedging relationship  risk management objective and strategy 
the documentation identifies the hedging instrument  the hedged item  the nature of the risk being hedged and the assumptions used to assess how effective the hedging instrument is in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item s fair value attributable to the hedged risk 
in the case of a cash flow hedge  this documentation includes the exposure to changes in the hedged transaction s variability in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk 
we do not exclude any component of the change in fair value of the hedging instrument from the effectiveness assessment 
at each reporting date  we confirm that the hedging instrument continues to be highly effective in offsetting the hedged risk 
the determination of whether a hedging instrument is effective both at its inception and on an on going basis requires a significant degree of judgment

deferred policy acquisition cost dac amortization we incur significant costs in connection with acquiring business 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring business are deferred and recorded as an asset on the consolidated statements of financial position 
dac related to property liability contracts is amortized to income as premiums are earned  generally over periods of six to twelve months 
the amortization methodology for dac for allstate financial policies and contracts includes significant assumptions and estimates 
dac related to traditional life insurance is amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the estimated revenues on such business 
assumptions relating to estimated premiums  investment income and realized capital gains and losses  as well as to all other aspects of dac are determined based upon conditions as of the date of policy issuance and are generally not revised during the life of the policy 
any deviations from projected business in force  resulting from actual policy terminations differing from expected levels  and any estimated premium deficiencies  change the rate of amortization in the period such events occur 
dac related to interest sensitive life  variable annuities and investment contracts is amortized in proportion to the incidence of the present value of estimated gross profits egp over the estimated lives of the contracts 
generally  the amortization period ranges from years 
however  an assumption for the rate of contract surrenders is also used  which results in the majority of the dac being amortized over the surrender charge period 
egp consists of estimates of the following components benefit margins primarily from mortality  including guaranteed minimum death  income and accumulation benefits  investment margin including realized capital gains and losses  and contract administration  surrender and other contract charges  less maintenance expenses 
for variable annuity and life contracts  the most significant assumptions involved in determining egp are the expected separate accounts fund performance after fees  surrender rates  lapse rates  and investment and mortality margins 
our long term assumption of separate accounts fund performance net of fees is approximately 
whenever actual separate accounts fund performance  based on the two most recent years  varies from  we project performance levels over the next five years such that the mean return over that seven year period equals the long term assumption 
this process is referred to as reversion to the mean and is commonly used by the life insurance industry 
although the use of a reversion to the mean assumption is common within the industry  the parameters used in the methodology are subject to judgment and vary between companies 
for example  when applying this assumption we do not allow the mean future rates of return after fees projected over the five year period to exceed or fall below 
revisions to egps result in changes in the cumulative amounts expensed as a component of amortization of dac in the period in which the revision is made 
this is commonly known as dac unlocking 
for quantification of the impact of these estimates and assumptions on allstate financial  see the allstate financial segment and forward looking statements and risk factors sections of the md a and note of the consolidated financial statements 
reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense estimation the property liability underwriting results are significantly influenced by estimates of the reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense 
these reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims  including claims that have been incurred but not reported ibnr  as of the reporting date 
allstate protection reserve estimates are based on known facts and interpretations of circumstances  internal factors including our experience with similar cases  historical trends involving claim payment patterns  loss payments  pending levels of unpaid claims  loss management programs and product mix 
in addition  the reserve estimates are influenced by external factors including law changes  court decisions  changes to regulatory requirements  economic conditions  and public attitudes 
in the normal course of business  we may also supplement our claims processes by utilizing third party adjusters  appraisers  engineers  inspectors  other professionals and information sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non catastrophe related claims 
the effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process 
because reserves are estimates of losses that have occurred  including ibnr losses  the establishment of appropriate reserves  including reserves for catastrophes  is an inherently uncertain and complex process 
the highest degree of uncertainty in estimating incurred losses is associated with reserves for the current accident year because the current accident year contains the greatest proportion of losses that have not been reported or settled  and that must be estimated as of the current reporting date 
that proportion diminishes in subsequent years 
the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts  which are based on our best estimates 
we regularly update our reserve estimates as new information becomes available and as events unfold that may affect the resolution of unsettled claims 
changes in prior year reserve estimates  which may be material  are reported in property liability insurance claims and claims expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period such changes are determinable 
we believe our net loss reserves are appropriately established based on available facts  technology  laws and regulations 
we calculate and record a single best reserve estimate  in conformance with generally accepted actuarial standards  for each line of insurance  its components coverages and perils  and state  for reported losses and for ibnr losses 
the aggregation of these estimates forms the reserve liability recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position 
based on our products and coverages  historical experience  and stochastic modeling of actuarial chain ladder methodologies used to develop reserve estimates  we estimate that the potential variability of our allstate protection reserves  within a reasonable probability of other possible outcomes  may be plus or minus  or plus or minus million in net income 
although this evaluation reflects the most likely outcomes  it is possible the final outcome may fall below or above these amounts 
establishing discontinued lines and coverages net loss reserves for asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines claims is subject to uncertainties that are much greater than those presented by other types of claims 
among the complications are lack of historical data  long reporting delays  uncertainties as to the number and identity of insureds with potential exposure  unresolved legal issues regarding policy coverage  unresolved legal issues regarding the determination  availability and timing of exhaustion of policy limits  evolving and expanding theories of liability  the risks inherent in major litigation  the availability and collectibility of recoveries from reinsurance  retrospectively determined premiums and other contractual agreements  estimations of the extent and timing of any contractual liability  and other uncertainties 
there are complex legal issues concerning the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are covered  or were ever intended to be covered  and could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium  reinsurance or other contractual agreements 
courts have reached different and sometimes inconsistent conclusions as to when losses are deemed to have occurred and which policies provide coverage  what types of losses are covered  whether there is an insurer obligation to defend  how policy limits are determined  how policy exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted  and whether clean up costs represent insured property damage 
we believe these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future  and the ultimate costs may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded resulting in material changes in loss reserves 
management believes its net loss reserves for environmental  asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures are appropriately established based on available facts  technology  laws and regulation 
due to the uncertainties and factors described above  management believes it is not practicable to develop a meaningful range for any such additional net loss reserves that may be required 
for further discussion of these policies and quantification of the impact of reserve estimates  reserve reestimates and assumptions  see notes and of the consolidated financial statements and the catastrophe losses  property liability claims and claims expense reserves and forward looking statements and risk factors sections of the md a 
reserve for life contingent contract benefits estimation long term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields  mortality  morbidity  policy terminations and expenses are used when establishing the reserve for life contingent contract benefits 
these assumptions  which for traditional life insurance are applied using the net level premium method  include provisions for adverse deviation and generally vary by such characteristics as type of coverage  year of issue and policy duration 
future investment yield assumptions are determined at the time the policy is issued based upon prevailing investment yields as well as estimated reinvestment yields 
mortality  morbidity and policy termination assumptions are based on our experience and industry experience prevailing at the time the policies are issued 
expense assumptions include the estimated effects of inflation and expenses to be incurred beyond the premium paying period

as a result of profit improvement actions  the encompass brand combined ratio improved points in to  while encompass brand standard auto pif declined compared to december  property liability operations overview our property liability operations consist of two business segments allstate protection and discontinued lines and coverages 
allstate protection is comprised of two brands  the allstate brand and encompass brand 
the encompass brand name replaced the name ivantage beginning in the third quarter of allstate protection is principally engaged in the sale of personal property and casualty insurance  primarily private passenger auto and homeowners insurance  to individuals in the united states and canada 
discontinued lines and coverages includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in run off 
these segments are consistent with the groupings of financial information that management uses to evaluate performance and to determine the allocation of resources 
underwriting income loss  a measure that is not based on gaap and is reconciled to net income on page  is calculated as premiums earned  less claims and claims expense losses  amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges  as determined using gaap 
we use this measure in our evaluation of results of operations to analyze the profitability of the property liability insurance operations separately from investment results 
it is also an integral component of incentive compensation 
it is useful for investors to evaluate the components of income separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance 
underwriting income loss should not be considered as a substitute for net income and does not reflect the overall profitability of the business 
net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure 
the table below includes gaap operating ratios we use to measure our profitability 
we believe that they enhance an investor s understanding of our profitability 
they are calculated as follows claims and claims expense loss ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned 
loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses 
expense ratio the ratio of amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned 
combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense  amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
the difference between and the combined ratio represents underwriting income as a percentage of premiums earned 
effect of discontinued lines and coverages on combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense and other costs and expenses in the discontinued lines and coverages segment to property liability premiums earned 
the sum of the effect of discontinued lines and coverages on the combined ratio and the allstate protection combined ratio on page is equal to the property liability combined ratio 
we have also calculated the following impacts of specific items on the gaap operating ratios because of the volatility of these items between fiscal periods 
effect of catastrophe losses on loss ratio the percentage of catastrophe losses included in claims and claims expenses to premiums earned 
effect of restructuring and related charges on expense ratio the percentage of restructuring and related charges to premiums earned

we are seeking  through the utilization of our distribution channels  tiered pricing and consumer marketing  to attract and retain high lifetime value customers who will potentially provide favorable prospects for profitability over the course of their relationship with us 
we continue to enhance technology to integrate our distribution channels  improve customer service  facilitate the introduction of new products and services and reduce infrastructure costs related to supporting agencies and handling claims 
we have aligned agency and management compensation and the overall strategies of the allstate brand to best serve our customers by basing certain incentives on allstate brand profitability and growth and sales of allstate financial products 
beginning in  we implemented and maintained a broader marketing approach throughout the us these actions and others are designed to optimize the effectiveness of our distribution and service channels by increasing the productivity of the allstate brand s exclusive agencies and the good hands network 
the encompass brand business sells private passenger auto and homeowners insurance to individuals through independent agencies 
encompass brand includes standard auto and homeowners products with the encompass sm brand name and non standard auto products with the deerbrook brand name 
our strategy for the encompass brand focuses on growing profitably  and growing in select markets  in part by using tiered pricing 
the integration of encompass policies onto allstate systems has resulted in a different counting process for pif 
as a result  percent changes in pif and average premium and the renewal ratio are subject to some distortion until the integration has been in place for a full year 
our sophisticated process for segmenting a market tiered pricing  and underwriting are designed to enhance both our competitive position and profit potential  and produce a broader range of premiums that is more refined than the range generated by the standard non standard model 
tiered pricing includes our strategic risk management srm program which considers  to the extent legally permissible  insurance scoring based on information that is obtained from credit reports as well as a number of other risk evaluation factors 
at the same time  we continue to expand the number of tiers with successive rating program releases  resulting in a diminishing capacity to draw meaningful comparisons to historical presentations 
our rating plans for private passenger auto insurance are no longer consistently segregated into standard plans and non standard plans 
in some states  we have implemented tiered pricing and modified our underwriting criteria in a way that allows us to write what may be considered both standard and non standard business with one tiered rating plan  which may also be considered a standard rating plan designed to accommodate non standard risks 
as we continue to use tiered pricing and underwriting  the distinctions between standard and non standard will become less important in certain states 
for this reason we are shifting our managerial focus to auto  which is the sum of standard auto and non standard auto 
we also believe it is useful for investors to analyze auto results that aggregate our standard and non standard business 
however  we will continue to provide results for standard and non standard auto 
generally  standard auto customers are expected to have lower risks of loss than non standard auto customers 
substantially all of new and approximately of renewal business written for allstate brand auto uses tiered pricing 
for allstate brand homeowners  approximately of new and of renewal business written uses tiered pricing 
for allstate brand auto and homeowners business written under tiered pricing  our results indicate an increase in retention and a shift toward more customers who we consider high lifetime value and who generate more favorable loss results 
another element of our strategy for our homeowners insurance business is to target customers whose risk of loss provides the best opportunity for profitable growth  including managing exposure on policies in areas where the potential loss from catastrophes exceeds acceptable levels 
this includes a continual reevaluation of our countrywide catastrophe risk management strategies for hurricanes and earthquakes 
homeowners product pricing is typically intended to establish returns that we deem acceptable over a long term period 
losses  including losses from catastrophic events and weather related losses such as wind  hail  lightning  freeze and water losses not meeting our criteria to be declared a catastrophe  are accrued on an occurrence basis within the policy period 
therefore  in any reporting period  loss experience from catastrophic events and weather related losses may contribute to negative or positive underwriting performance relative to the expectations we incorporated into the products pricing 
accordingly  homeowners products are more capital intensive than other personal lines products 
allstate protection s goal is to achieve pricing targets comprising a competitive combined ratio and return on equity 
our primary strategies to achieve this goal include continuing our efforts to seek approval for rate changes for all allstate protection products in all jurisdictions where we believe such changes are needed and can be obtained based on rate indicators  such as our projected claim frequency and severity experience and expense levels  and to pursue other actions affecting our profitability such as improving our underwriting and claims processes 
premiums written  an operating measure  is the amount of premiums charged for policies issued during a fiscal period 
premiums earned is a gaap measure 
premiums are considered earned and are included in the financial results on a pro rata basis over the policy period 
the portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums on our consolidated statements of financial position 
since the allstate brand policy periods are typically months for auto and months for homeowners  encompass auto and homeowners policy periods are typically months and deerbrook auto policy periods are typically months  rate changes taken during and will generally be recognized in premiums earned over a period of to months 
during this period  premiums written at a higher rate will cause an increase in the balance of unearned premiums on our consolidated statements of financial position

revised to reflect new counting methodology for encompass brand 
pif  renewal ratio and average gross premium are subject to some distortion due to continued integration of systems 
the increase in allstate brand standard auto pif in when compared to is primarily the result of increases in new business due to the implementation of a broader marketing approach in most of the us and an increased renewal ratio  which management believes is related to reduced rate activity and improved customer loyalty 
although growth in new business remains above prior year  this trend leveled off during sequential growth of allstate brand standard auto pif for the last four quarters has averaged each quarter 
new business comparisons also reflect the july implementation of our new rating plan in the california market 
the increase in the allstate brand standard auto average premium in compared to is primarily due to higher average renewal premiums 
the rate of increase in average premium has declined in due to the decrease in rate activity 
the reduced level of rate changes in the current year are due to declines in frequency and severity as discussed in the underwriting results section 
the increase in the allstate brand standard auto average premium in when compared to is primarily due to higher average renewal premiums 
higher average renewal premiums resulted from rate actions taken in the last three years and  to a lesser degree  a normal shift by policyholders to newer and more expensive autos 
the increases in new business premiums  pif and the renewal ratio in compared to are due to an improved loss ratio driving more modest need for rate increases and to the implementation of a broader marketing approach in most of the us encompass brand standard auto new business premiums written increased in when compared to and renewal business premiums written decreased in when compared to primarily due to increases in new pif and rate activity  the effect of which is declining due to the decrease in rate change activity 
encompass brand standard auto premiums written increased in when compared to primarily due to profit improvement actions resulting in increased average premium per policy  partially offset by fewer pif 
increased average premiums per policy were related to rate actions taken during the last three years 
we expect the rate of decline in encompass brand standard auto pif to moderate 
our improved profitability has positioned us to pursue growth opportunities in this channel

pif  renewal ratio and average gross premium are subject to some distortion due to continued integration of systems 
the allstate brand homeowners pif increase in compared to is the result of the increases in new business due to a broader marketing approach in most of the us and an increased renewal ratio  which management believes is related to reduced rate activity and increased customer loyalty 
due to recent hurricanes  beginning in september  we have curtailed our acceptance of new business in florida  which will continue to adversely impact our growth in new business premiums 
sequential growth of allstate brand homeowners pif for the last four quarters has averaged each quarter 
the increases in average premium during and were primarily due to higher average renewal premiums in both years 
higher average renewal premiums were related to increasing home values  along with rate actions taken in the current and prior year 
the reduced level of rate changes in the current year are due to declines in frequency and severity as discussed in the underwriting results section

changes in auto current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the medical and auto repair sectors of the economy 
we mitigate these effects through various loss management programs 
injury claims are affected largely by medical cost inflation while physical damage claims are affected largely by auto repair cost inflation and used car prices 
our rate of increase in incurred injury claim severity during and was lower than the relevant medical cost indices 
we believe our claim settlement initiatives  such as improvements to the claim settlement process  medical management programs  the use of special investigative units to detect fraud and handle suspect claims  litigation management and defense strategies  as well as various loss management initiatives underway  contribute positively to the mitigation of injury severity trends 
however  auto injury claim severity could offset the success of these programs  therefore  we will continue to pursue claim mitigation programs 
for auto physical damage coverages  we monitor our rate of increase in average cost per claim against a weighted average of the body work price index and the used car price index 
in  our rate of increase in incurred physical damage current year claim severity was generally lower than the weighted index 
in  our rate of increase in incurred physical damage current year claim severity was generally higher than the weighted index 
we believe that results were favorably impacted by the application of enhanced claim settlement practices for auto physical damage claims 
accordingly  we continue to pursue various loss management initiatives that we expect to contribute positively to the mitigation of physical damage severity trends 
however  during the increase in auto physical damage claim severity more than offset the success of these programs 
changes in homeowners current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the cost of building materials  the cost of construction and property repair services  the cost of replacing home furnishings and other contents  the types of claims that qualify for coverage  deductibles and other economic and environmental factors 
in and  we experienced an increase in homeowners severity compared to prior year 
we employ various loss management programs to mitigate the effect of these factors  however  homeowners severity may increase  offsetting the success of these programs 
we have also taken numerous actions that we expect to contribute to profitable trends in the homeowners loss ratio 
loss ratios are a measure of profitability 
loss ratios by product  and expense and combined ratios by brand  are shown in the following table 
these ratios are defined on page loss ratio effect of catastrophe losses on the loss ratio allstate brand loss ratio standard auto non standard auto auto homeowners other total allstate brand loss ratio allstate brand expense ratio allstate brand combined ratio encompass brand loss ratio standard auto non standard auto deerbrook auto homeowners other encompass brand loss ratio encompass brand expense ratio encompass brand combined ratio total allstate protection loss ratio allstate protection expense ratio allstate protection combined ratio standard auto loss ratio declined points for the allstate brand and points for the encompass brand in when compared to these declines were due to higher premiums earned  favorable reserve reestimates related to prior years and lower claim frequency  partially offset by higher current year claim severity 
standard auto claim frequency in the fourth quarter of increased slightly over the prior year quarter due to weather related events in the last two weeks of  however  our underlying frequency trends remain favorable 
in  the allstate brand standard auto loss ratio declined points and the encompass brand standard auto loss ratio declined points when compared to the declines in were due to higher premiums earned  lower claim frequency and favorable reserve reestimates related to prior years  partially offset by higher catastrophe losses and claim severity 
non standard auto loss ratio declined points for the allstate brand and points for encompass brand in when compared to these declines were due to favorable reserve reestimates related to prior years and lower claim frequency  partially offset by higher current year claim severity 
in  the allstate brand non standard loss ratio declined points and the encompass brand non standard loss ratio declined points 
these declines were due to lower claim frequency  favorable reserve reestimates and higher premiums earned in encompass brand  partially offset by higher catastrophe losses and higher claim severities 
auto loss ratio declined points for the allstate brand and points for the encompass brand in when compared to these declines were due to favorable reserve reestimates related to prior years  lower claim frequency and higher premiums earned for allstate brand  partially offset by higher current year claim severity 
in  the allstate brand auto loss ratio declined points and the encompass brand auto loss ratio declined points when compared to these declines were due to higher premiums earned and lower claim frequency and favorable reserve reestimates  partially offset by higher catastrophe losses and claim severity 
homeowners loss ratio increased points for the allstate brand and declined points for the encompass brand in when compared to these fluctuations were due to higher catastrophes partially offset by higher premiums earned  favorable reserve reestimates related to prior years and lower claim frequency  excluding catastrophes for the allstate brand  and higher current year claim severity 
in  the allstate brand loss ratio declined points and the encompass brand loss ratio increased points when compared to these fluctuations were due to higher premiums earned  lower claim frequency and favorable reserve reestimates for the allstate brand  including lower than anticipated losses in texas related to mold claims  offset by increased catastrophe losses  higher claim severity and higher reserve reestimates for encompass brand 
allstate brand incurred losses related to mold claims in texas were negligible in compared to losses of million in for homeowners  we implemented programs such as market or state specific product designs  rate increases  underwriting and rating changes  discontinuation of specific coverages  specific policy language clarifying coverage for mold claims and loss management initiatives to improve the profitability of this business 
because of the success of these programs we returned this business to profitability in  although volatility in underwriting results during was caused by catastrophes 
expense ratio for allstate protection increased in compared to due to higher amortization of dac resulting from higher agent incentives and increases in marketing expense 
higher agent incentives were based on higher underlying profitability and increases in premium written 
expense ratio for allstate protection increased in compared to due to higher agent incentives  marketing expenditures  charitable contributions and employee related expenses 
the impact of specific costs and expenses on the expense ratio is included in the following table 
allstate brand encompass brand amortization of dac other costs and expenses restructuring and related charges total expense ratio the expense ratio for the standard auto and homeowners businesses generally approximate the total allstate protection expense ratio of in  in and in the expense ratio for the non standard auto business generally is lower than the total allstate protection expense ratio due to lower agent commission rates and higher average premiums for non standard auto as compared to standard auto 
the encompass brand expense ratio is higher on average than the expense ratio of the allstate brand due to higher commission rates and licensing fees paid to cna financial corporation 
allstate protection underwriting income was impacted by restructuring charges 
for a more detailed discussion of these charges  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
net income was also favorably impacted in by adjustments for prior year tax liabilities totaling million 
dac we establish a dac asset for costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring business  principally agents remuneration  premium taxes  certain underwriting and direct mail solicitation expenses 
for the allstate protection business  dac is amortized to income consistent with the timeframes in which premiums are earned

we define a catastrophe as an event that produces pre tax losses before reinsurance in excess of million and involves multiple first party policyholders  or an event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset  per event threshold of average claims in a specific area  occurring within a certain amount of time following the event 
catastrophes are caused by various natural events including earthquakes  volcanoes  wildfires  tornadoes  hailstorms  hurricanes  tropical storms  high winds and winter storms 
we are also exposed to human made catastrophic events  such as certain acts of terrorism or industrial accidents 
the nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted 
over time we have limited our aggregate insurance exposure to catastrophe losses in certain regions of the country that are subject to high levels of natural catastrophes 
actions we have taken to limit our exposure include purchase of reinsurance in certain states  restricting the amount and location of new business  limiting the availability of certain policy coverages  placing policies with third parties  and increasing our participation in catastrophe pools 
however  the impact of these actions may be diminished by the growth in insured values  the effect of state insurance laws and regulations and by the effect of competitive considerations 
we have also requested and received rate increases and have expanded the use of hurricane  tropical cyclone and earthquake deductibles in certain regions that are subject to high levels of catastrophes 
we consider the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to hurricanes to be major metropolitan centers near the eastern and gulf coasts of the united states  and the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to earthquakes to be california  areas surrounding the new madrid fault system in the midwest and faults in and surrounding seattle  washington and charleston  south carolina 
for further disclosure of our participation in the fhcf  citizens property insurance corporation and the california earthquake authority cea  which limit our exposure to catastrophes in certain areas  see notes and of the consolidated financial statements 
we include catastrophe losses in property liability claims and claims expense 
as a result  catastrophe losses affect both our underwriting results and loss ratios 
during  catastrophe losses totaled billion  compared to catastrophe losses of billion in and million in of the billion of catastrophe losses incurred during  billion related to hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne  which struck portions of florida  the southeastern seaboard  and other parts of the united states 
estimates of losses from hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne at december  are shown in the table below in millions personal lines gross losses fhcf recoveries net losses charley august frances september ivan september jeanne september subtotal   commercial total loss estimate   since our preliminary provision for losses of billion  net of recoveries from the fhcf  as of september   we revised our provision for these four hurricane losses to billion  net of recoveries from the fhcf  as of december  estimates of losses for these storms were increased due to increased estimates of claim severity on personal lines and commercial property claims in florida 
when the initial estimates for these storms were prepared in the third quarter  these storms had only recently occurred  very few losses had been paid  and due to the extensive devastation and massive scale of these storms  it was not possible to gain access to and physically inspect a sufficiently large portion of claims 
during the fourth quarter  property inspections were completed by claim adjusters and  consequently  we were able to develop more accurate assessments of the actual cost of physical damages 
a significant amount of these losses have been paid 
estimates of gross qualifying personal property losses for charley  frances and ivan have exceeded the million per occurrence fhcf retention  thus permitting reimbursement of of qualifying losses above the retention 
for jeanne  estimated qualifying property losses are million  which is below the fhcf retention 
estimates of qualifying commercial habitational property losses for charley and frances have exceeded the million per occurrence fhcf retention 
for ivan and jeanne  estimated qualifying commercial habitational property losses are million and million  respectively  which are below the fhcf retention 
for all of the storms  any adverse development of losses not qualifying for fhcf reimbursement will adversely impact net income if and when determined 
the current estimates of losses for these storms have a much greater degree of certainty than previous estimates  which were prepared shortly after these storms occurred 
however  there are still factors and complications that may cause future development of these estimates to be either favorable or unfavorable 
among other things  there are still claims to be reported  we are still evaluating the impact in communities that were hit by more than one hurricane  and our evaluation of losses is complicated by the fact that property damage resulted from both flooding  which allstate policies do not cover  and high winds  which allstate policies typically do cover 
in addition  because of increased demand for services and supplies in the areas affected by the hurricanes and the length of time required to repair the damage  our loss estimates may not accurately reflect inflated costs of repair 
finally  the net loss estimates could be affected by the amount of fhcf reimbursements actually received 
historical catastrophe experience in the last years  the average annual impact of catastrophes on our property liability loss ratio was pts 
however  this average does not reflect the impact of some of the more significant actions we have taken to limit our catastrophe exposure 
consequently  we think it is useful to consider the impact of catastrophes after excluding losses that are now substantially covered by the cea  fhcf or placed with a third party 
the average annual impact of all catastrophes  excluding losses from hurricanes andrew and iniki and losses from california earthquakes  on our property liability loss ratio was during the last years 
comparatively  the average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio over the last years  excluding losses from hurricane andrew  california earthquakes and hawaii hurricanes during that period was points  with an impact of in areas bordering the eastern and gulf coasts with hurricane exposure and an impact of in all other areas 
allstate protection outlook we expect to see continued growth of allstate brand auto premiums written due to increased pif resulting from increases in the number and productivity of agents representing us  increased advertising effectiveness and higher customer loyalty partially offset by consistent average gross premiums 
we will continue to review our homeowners business in order to determine its potential for future profitability 
our review may result in actions designed to limit our catastrophe risk such as increased purchases of reinsurance  increased rates or limitations on new business writings 
as a result of the four hurricanes in florida and their very adverse financial impacts and in an effort to mitigate our exposure to catastrophe risk  we are currently evaluating various actions that could negatively impact the level of homeowners premiums written and profitability 
the actions under consideration include continued suspension of writing new business  purchasing additional reinsurance and other actions to reduce exposure to hurricanes  including placing policies with third parties  increasing rates  and advancing proposals for legislative reform 
additionally  the state of florida has taken other actions that could negatively impact our level of homeowners premiums written and profitability  including changing to seasonal hurricane deductibles  discouraging insurance companies from increasing rates and not allowing non renewal of policies 
we expect to experience premium growth in the encompass brand during since we have attained profitability in this business 
we expect that volatility in the level of catastrophes or claim frequency we experience will contribute to variation in our underwriting results 
we will continue to examine our expenses for additional areas where costs may be reduced 
any reductions in costs we achieve  however  may be offset by the costs of other new initiatives  such as increased expenditures for technology 
we expect advertising expenses in to be comparable to expenses  which were approximately million  but will be more focused on our target customers 
in addition  other factors may increase our expenses  including an adverse market impact on net periodic pension cost  increases in other benefit expenses and guaranty fund assessments 
discontinued lines and coverages segment overview the discontinued lines and coverages segment includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in run off 
we have assigned management of this segment to a designated group of professionals with expertise in claims handling  policy coverage interpretation and exposure identification 
our exposure to asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines claims arises in this segment 
summarized underwriting results for the years ended december  are presented in the following table 
in millions premiums written premiums earned claims and claims expense other costs and expenses underwriting loss during  the underwriting loss was primarily due to reestimates of asbestos reserves totaling million  and an increase of million in the allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance 
the cost of administering claims settlements totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  the underwriting loss was also primarily due to our annual review of reserves for asbestos  environmental  and other discontinued lines exposures  resulting in an increase in reserves totaling million  including increases for asbestos of million  million due to new information received for two manufacturing insureds in bankruptcy  and million for an excess insurance policyholder who submitted new and unanticipated claims that were for previously not designated  and therefore unexpected  coverage years 
see the property liability claims and claims expense reserves for a more detailed discussion 
discontinued lines and coverages outlook we may continue to experience asbestos losses in the future 
these losses could be due to the potential adverse impact of new information relating to new and additional claims or the impact of resolving unsettled claims based on unanticipated events such as litigation or legislative  judicial and regulatory actions 
because of our annual ground up review  we believe that our reserves are appropriately established based on available information  technology  laws and regulations 
property liability investment results net investment income increased in when compared to last year  after increasing in when compared to these increases were due to higher portfolio balances resulting from positive cash flows from operations and investment activities and higher income from partnerships  partially offset by lower portfolio yields

investment outlook the property liability investment portfolio relies upon positive cash flows to support investment purchases 
cash flows available for investment can be impacted by volatility in underwriting results and the level of dividends paid by allstate insurance company aic to the allstate corporation 
the amount of cash flow available to invest directly impacts the amount of property liability net investment income 
allstate expects to experience lower investment yields due  in part  to the reinvestment of proceeds from security prepayments  calls and maturities  and the investment of cash flows from operations in securities yielding less than the average portfolio rate 
property liability claims and claims expense reserves underwriting results of property liability are significantly influenced by estimates of property liability claims and claims expense reserves 
we describe our reserve process in the application of critical accounting policies section of the md a and note of the consolidated financial statements 
these reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims  including ibnr claims  as of the reporting date 
reserves are established for claims as they occur for each line of business based on estimates of the ultimate cost to settle the claims 
the actual loss results are compared to prior estimates and differences are recorded as reserve reestimates 
the primary actuarial technique used to estimate reserves and provide for losses is a chain ladder estimation process in which historical loss patterns are applied to actual paid losses and reported losses paid losses plus individual case reserves set by claim adjusters for an accident year or a report year to create an estimate of how losses are likely to develop over time 
an accident year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims occurred 
a report year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims are reported 
both classifications are used to prepare estimates of required reserves for payments to be made in the future 
in the chain ladder estimation technique  a ratio development factor is calculated which compares current results to results in the prior period for each accident year 
a three year or two year average development factor  based on historical results  is usually multiplied by the current experience to estimate the development of losses of each accident year from the current time period into the next time period 
the development factors for the next time periods for each accident year are compounded over the remaining calendar years to calculate an estimate of ultimate losses for each accident year 
occasionally  unusual aberrations in loss patterns are caused by factors such as changes in claim reporting  settlement patterns  unusually large losses  process changes  legal or regulatory changes  and other influences 
in these instances  analyses of alternate development factor selections are performed to evaluate the effect of these factors  and actuarial judgment is applied to make appropriate development factor assumptions needed to develop a best estimate of ultimate losses 
paid losses are then subtracted from estimated ultimate losses to determine the indicated reserves 
the difference between indicated reserves and recorded reserves is the amount of reserve reestimate 
reserves are reestimated quarterly 
when new development factors are calculated from actual losses  and they differ from estimated development factors used in previous reserve estimates  assumptions about losses and required reserves are revised based on the new development factors 
changes to reserves are recorded in the period in which development factor changes result in reserve reestimates 
over one thousand actuarial estimates of the types described above are prepared each quarter to monitor losses for each line of insurance  major components of losses such as coverages and perils  major states or groups of states and for reported losses and ibnr 
often  several different estimates are prepared for each detailed component  incorporating alternative analyses of changing claim settlement patterns and other influences on losses  from which we select our best estimate for each component  occasionally incorporating additional analyses and actuarial judgment  as described above 
these estimates also incorporate the historical impact of inflation into reserve estimates  the implicit assumption being that a multi year average development factor represents an adequate provision 
based on our review of these estimates  our best estimate of required reserves for each state line coverage component is recorded for each accident year  and the required reserves for each component are summed to create the reserve balances carried on our consolidated statements of financial position 
the facts and circumstances leading to our reestimate of reserves relate to revisions to the development factors used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid 
reestimates occur because actual losses are different than that predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates 
at december   the impact of a reserve reestimation resulting in a one percent increase in net reserves would be a decrease of approximately million in net income 
a reserve reestimation resulting in a one percent decrease in net reserves would increase net income by approximately million 
for a further description of our reserving policies and the potential variability in our reserve estimates  see the application of critical accounting policies section of the md a 
for allstate protection  at each reporting date the highest degree of uncertainty in estimates of losses arises from claims remaining to be settled for the current accident year and the most recent preceding accident year 
the greatest degree of uncertainty exists in the current accident year because  at the end of the current accident year  the percentage of losses that have not been reported or settled and that consequently must be estimated  is higher than it will be as time elapses 
most of these losses relate to damaged property such as automobiles and to medical care for injuries from accidents 
during the first year after the end of an accident year  a large portion of the total losses for that accident year are settled 
when accident year losses paid through the end of the first year following the accident year are incorporated into updated actuarial estimates  the trends inherent in the settlement of claims emerge more clearly 
consequently  this is the point in time at which we tend to make our largest reestimates of losses for an accident year 
after the second year  the losses that we pay for an accident year typically relate to claims that are more difficult to settle  such as those involving serious injuries or litigation 
private passenger auto insurance provides a good illustration of the uncertainty of future loss estimates our typical annual percentage payout of reserves estimated losses for an accident year is approximately in the first year after the end of the accident year  in the second year  in the third year  in the fourth year  and the remaining thereafter

this resulted in reserve reestimates including million related to ibnr  million related to claim severity and million related to mold claims in texas 
in addition  reserves were increased million for settlement of losses remaining from the northridge earthquake 
in march  a new texas homeowner policy form was implemented that restricted mold coverage from what had been provided by a previous broad state mandated policy form 
as a result  coverage provided and the incidence of losses for mold diminished in the second half of the year 
reserve reestimates in and for the northridge earthquake losses were to provide for higher than anticipated losses resulting from settlement of class action litigation and due to greater than expected additional losses and expenses caused by coverage afforded due to the passage of california s senate bill in other lines reserve reestimates in   and were primarily the result of claim severity development different than anticipated in previous estimates

reestimates of reserves from prior years for auto and other businesses were million for the year  of which million was for canadian business reserves 
these reestimates were primarily due to increasing inflationary pressures on auto severities and for some of the small non auto products 
these trends are primarily responsible for revisions to loss development factors  as previously described  used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid 
because these trends cause actual losses to differ from those predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates  reserves are revised as actuarial studies validate new trends  based on the indications of updated development factor calculations

this increase essentially was a result of a continuing level of increased claim activity being reported by excess insurance policyholders with existing active claims  and reestimates of liabilities for increased assumed reinsurance cessions  as ceding companies other insurance carriers also experienced increased claim activity 
increased claim activity over prior estimates has also resulted in an increased estimate for future claims reported 
these trends are consistent with the trends of other carriers in the industry  which we believe are related to increased publicity and awareness of coverage  ongoing litigation  potential congressional activity and bankruptcy actions 
during  reserve reestimates  including an increase in the allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance recoverables  included million for other discontinued lines exposures in run off  and million related to the cost of administering claim settlements and miscellaneous run off exposures 
reserve additions for asbestos in  totaling million  were primarily for products related coverage 
this increase essentially was a result of more claimants being reported by excess insurance policyholders with existing active claims and new claims being reported in our assumed reinsurance business 
this trend is consistent with the trends of other carriers in the industry 
we believe it is related to increased publicity and awareness of coverage  ongoing litigation  potential congressional activity and bankruptcy actions 
during  reserve reestimates included million for other discontinued lines exposures in run off  and million related to the cost of administering claim settlements and miscellaneous run off exposures 
in  asbestos reserves were increased by million primarily due to final settlement of exposure to an insured and adverse reestimates on other estimated asbestos losses due to an increase in claims from smaller more peripheral exposures 
pending asbestos claims related to excess policies issued to manufacturers that have filed for bankruptcy protection also increased to a minor extent 
reserve reestimates also included million for other discontinued lines exposures in run off and million related to the cost of administering claim settlements and miscellaneous run off exposures 
our exposure to asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines claims arises principally from assumed reinsurance coverage written during the s through the mid s  including reinsurance on primary insurance written on large united states companies  and from direct excess insurance written from through  including substantial excess general liability coverages on fortune companies 
additional exposure stems from direct primary commercial insurance written during the s through the mid s 
other discontinued lines exposures primarily relate to general liability and product liability mass tort claims  such as those for medical devices and other products 
in  the general liability policy form used by us and others in the property liability industry was amended to introduce an absolute pollution exclusion  which excluded coverage for environmental damage claims  and to add an asbestos exclusion 
most general liability policies issued prior to contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage 
general liability policies issued in and thereafter contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage and annual aggregate limits for all coverages 
our experience to date is that these policy form changes have limited the extent of our exposure to environmental and asbestos claim risks 
our exposure to liability for asbestos  environmental  and other discontinued lines losses manifests differently depending on whether it arises from assumed reinsurance coverage  direct excess insurance  or direct primary commercial insurance 
the direct insurance coverage we provided that covered asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines was substantially excess in nature 
direct excess insurance and reinsurance involve coverage written by us for specific layers of protection above retentions and other insurance plans 
the nature of excess coverage and reinsurance provided to other insurers limits our exposure to loss to specific layers of protection in excess of policyholder retention or primary insurance plans 
our exposure is further limited by the significant reinsurance that we have purchased on our excess business 
our assumed reinsurance business involved writing generally small participations in other insurers reinsurance programs 
the reinsured losses in which we participate may be a proportion of all eligible losses or eligible losses in excess of defined retentions 
the majority of our assumed reinsurance exposure  approximately  is for excess of loss coverage  while the remaining is for pro rata coverage 
our direct primary commercial insurance business did not include coverage to large asbestos manufacturers 
this business comprises a cross section of policyholders engaged in many diverse business sectors located throughout the country 
the table below summarizes reserves and claim activity for asbestos and environmental claims before gross and after net the effects of reinsurance for the past three years

this is a commonly used but extremely simplistic and imprecise approach to measuring the adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserve levels 
many factors  such as mix of business  level of coverage provided and settlement procedures have significant impacts on the amount of environmental and asbestos claims and claims expense reserves  claim payments and the resultant ratio 
as payments result in corresponding reserve reductions  survival ratios can be expected to vary over time 
in and  the asbestos survival ratios improved due to higher reserve balances and relatively low payments 
in  the environmental survival ratios improved due to lower claim payments paid  while in the ratios declined slightly due to a lower reserve balance 
the total commutations  policy buy backs  and settlement agreements and the survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims for  and excluding these commutations  policy buy backs  and settlement agreements  are represented in the following table

now at years for asbestos as of december   we consider it to represent a strong reserve position 
a one year increase in the three year average asbestos survival ratio at december  would require an after tax increase in reserves of approximately million

the increase comprised from  from and from the increase of from included new policyholders reporting new claims and policyholders claims were closed 
reserve additions for asbestos for the year ended december   totaled million and included the following factors direct primary insurance net reserves decreased by million 
we were not a significant direct primary insurer and did not insure any of the large asbestos manufacturers on a direct primary insurance basis 
direct excess insurance net reserves increased by million for policyholders with existing active claims 
the increase in existing active claims was attributable to an increase in the number of claims filed against direct excess insureds 
assumed reinsurance net reserves increased by million for increased cessions as ceding companies other insurance carriers also experienced increased claim activity 
many of the insureds that reported claims to us on their direct excess insurance coverages also reported claims to carriers included in our assumed reinsurance exposure 
the number of reported new claims is shown in the following table 
year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  new claims new claims are defined as the aggregate number of policyholders with claims reported by all ceding companies 
ibnr net reserves increased by million in anticipation of continued claims activity 
at december  ibnr represented of total asbestos reserves  points higher than at december  ibnr reserves are estimated to provide for probable future unfavorable reserve development of known claims and future reporting of additional unknown claims from current and new direct active insurance policyholders and ceding companies 
our non products case reserves represent approximately of total asbestos case reserves 
we do not anticipate significant changes in this percentage as insureds retentions associated with excess insurance programs and assumed reinsurance exposure are seldom exceeded 
we did not write direct primary insurance on policyholders with the potential for significant non products related loss exposure 
for environmental exposures  a comprehensive ground up review  using processes similar to those used for the asbestos review  is also conducted in the third quarter of each year 
the analysis performed in and produced essentially no change in reserve estimates 
environmental loss emergence in was primarily due to losses from one large reinsurance contract and a few other direct losses 
in past years environmental reestimates have been favorable 
pending  new  total closed and closed without payment claims for asbestos and environmental exposures for the years ended december  are summarized in the following table 
number of claims asbestos pending  beginning of year    new    total closed  pending  end of year    closed without payment environmental pending  beginning of year    new  total closed    pending  end of year    closed without payment    our reserves for asbestos and environmental exposures could be affected by tort reform  class action litigation  and other potential legislation and judicial decisions 
environmental exposures could also be affected by a change in the existing federal superfund law and similar state statutes 
there can be no assurance that any reform legislation will be enacted or that any such legislation will provide for a fair  effective and cost efficient system for settlement of asbestos or environmental claims 
we are unable to determine the effect  if any  that such legislation will have on results of operations or financial position 
reserves for other discontinued lines provide for remaining loss and loss expense liabilities related to business no longer written by us  other than asbestos and environmental  and are presented in the following table

workers compensation and commercial and other include run off from discontinued primary  excess and reinsurance commercial insurance operations of various coverage exposures other than asbestos and environmental 
reserves are based on considerations similar to those previously described  as they relate to the characteristics of specific individual coverage exposures 
we believe that our reserves are appropriately established based on assessments of pertinent factors and characteristics of exposure eg claim activity  potential liability  jurisdiction  products versus non products exposure presented by individual policyholders  assuming no change in the legal  legislative or economic environment 
another comprehensive ground up review will be completed in the third quarter of  as well as assessments each quarter to determine if any intervening significant events or developments require an interim adjustment to reserves 
property liability reinsurance ceded we participate in various reinsurance mechanisms  including industry pools and facilities  and have purchased reinsurance to mitigate long tail liability lines  including environmental  asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures 
we retain primary liability as a direct insurer for all risks ceded to reinsurers 
the impacts of reinsurance on our reserve for claims and claims expense at december are summarized in the following table  net of allowances we have established for uncollectible amounts 
gross claims and claims expense reserves reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid claims  net in millions industry pools and facilities   asbestos and environmental    other including allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance recoverables total property liability     when purchasing reinsurance  we evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer  as well as the terms and price of coverage 
estimating amounts of reinsurance recoverables is also impacted by the uncertainties involved in the establishment of loss reserves 
we believe the recoverables are appropriately established  however  as our underlying reserves continue to develop  the amount ultimately recoverable may vary from amounts currently recorded 
we regularly evaluate the reinsurers and the respective amounts recoverable  and a provision for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded if needed 
adverse developments in the insurance industry have recently led to a decline in the financial strength of some of our reinsurance carriers  causing amounts recoverable from them and future claims ceded to them to be considered a higher risk 
recently there has also been consolidation activity between some of our carriers and potential carriers in the industry  which causes reinsurance risk across the industry to be concentrated among fewer companies 
in addition  over the last several years the industry has increasingly segregated asbestos  environmental  and other discontinued lines exposures into separate legal entities with dedicated capital 
regulatory bodies in certain cases have supported these actions 
we are unable to determine the impact  if any  that these developments will have on the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables in the future 
the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance relates to discontinued lines and coverages reinsurance recoverables and was million and million at december  and  respectively 
these amounts represent and  respectively of the related reinsurance recoverable balances 
the increase in is due to potential uncollectible reinsurance related to the asbestos reserve increase and the refinement of our bad debt allowance to provide a greater allowance for companies who have reorganized to segregate asbestos  environmental  and other discontinued lines exposures into separate legal entities with dedicated capital

total premiums decreased in compared to the decrease was primarily the result of the discontinuance of the majority of our direct response business in  lower traditional life and immediate annuity premium  partially offset by higher premiums from supplemental accident and health and other products sold through the workplace 
contract charges increased in compared to the increase was primarily due to higher contract charges on interest sensitive life and variable annuities 
the increase in the interest sensitive life contract charges was attributable to in force business growth resulting from deposits and credited interest more than offsetting contract charges  surrenders and benefits 
higher variable annuity contract charges were the result of increased average account values during  reflecting positive investment results during and variable annuity contract charges  as a percent of average separate account values  increased to basis points in from basis points in driven by increases in fees charged for our variable annuity benefits on the allstate advisor product in addition to a higher percentage of our in force contracts providing these benefits

variable annuity contract charges  as a percent of average separate account values  increased to basis points in from basis points in as a result of increases in benefit rider fee rates and utilization by contractholders 
contractholder funds represent interest bearing liabilities arising from the sale of individual and institutional products  such as interest sensitive life  fixed annuities  bank deposits and funding agreements

separate accounts liabilities  excluding the impact of adopting sop  increased billion during the increase was primarily attributable to positive investment results 
net deposits and transfers from fixed accounts were mostly offset by surrenders and benefits 
variable annuity contractholders often allocate a significant portion of their initial variable annuity contract deposit into a fixed rate investment option 
the level of this activity is reflected above in the deposits allocated to fixed accounts  while all other transfer activity between the fixed and separate accounts investment options is reflected in net transfers from fixed accounts 
the liability for the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts is reflected in contractholder funds 
separate accounts liabilities increased billion during compared to reflecting a significant improvement in investment results and net deposits  partially offset by surrenders and benefits 
the increase in the variable annuity net deposits in resulted from the increasing attractiveness of the separate accounts equity investment funds following improved equity market performance and the introduction of the multi manager allstate advisor variable annuity product 
net investment income increased in compared to and in compared to the increase in both periods was the result of the effect of higher portfolio balances  partially offset by lower portfolio yields 
higher portfolio balances resulted from the investment of cash flows from operating and financing activities related primarily to deposits from fixed annuities and interest sensitive life policies and institutional funding agreements 
investment balances as of december   increased from december  and increased as of december  compared to december  the lower portfolio yields were primarily due to purchases  including reinvestments  of fixed income securities with yields lower than the current portfolio average

we use gross margin as a component of our evaluation of the profitability of allstate financial s life insurance and financial product portfolio 
additionally  for many of our products  including fixed annuities  variable life and annuities  and interest sensitive life insurance  the amortization of dac and dsi is determined based on actual and expected gross margin 
gross margin is comprised of four components that are utilized to further analyze the business investment margin  benefit margin  maintenance charges and surrender charges 
we believe gross margin and its components are useful to investors because they allow for the evaluation of income components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance 
gross margin  investment margin and benefit margin should not be considered as a substitute for net income and do not reflect the overall profitability of the business 
net income is the gaap measure that is most directly comparable to these margins

benefit margin by product group is shown in the following table

as required by sop  as of january   a reserve was established for benefits provided for under variable annuities and secondary guarantees on interest sensitive life insurance and certain fixed annuity contracts 
for variable annuities  the reserve includes gmdbs and guaranteed minimum income benefits gmibs 
in previous periods  gmdbs were expensed as paid and no costs were recognizable for gmibs or other guarantees 
under the sop  we anticipate that the benefit margin will be less volatile  as contract benefit expense pertaining to product guarantees will be proportionate to the related revenue rather than cash payments made during the period

for further explanation of the impacts of the adoption of this accounting guidance  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
benefit margin was million in  reflecting a million or decline compared to an increase in gmdbs on variable annuity contracts in compared to represents million of the million decline 
the remainder was due to a larger number of life claims in the first quarter of  poor mortality results on certain closed blocks of business and the effect of the discontinuance of direct response non life credit insurance  partially offset by higher mortality margin from growth of interest sensitive life and accident and health products sold through the workplace 
in  gmdb payments were million  net of reinsurance  hedging results and other contractual arrangements net gmdb payments  compared to million in while net gmdb payments were higher than in  improved equity market performance during resulted in sequential quarterly reductions in gross gmdb payments 
direct response non life credit insurance generated a benefit margin of million and million in and  respectively 
amortization of dac and dsi increased during compared to the higher amortization is reflective of increased gross margins on fixed and variable annuities 
in  amortization of dac and dsi included an acceleration of dac amortization commonly referred to as dac unlocking totaling million and million of dac amortization on the direct response distribution business sold in the adoption of sop required a new modeling approach for estimating expected future gross profits that are used when determining the amortization of dac 
because of this new modeling approach  effective january   the variable annuity dac and dsi assets were reduced by million 
this reduction was recognized as a component of cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
amortization of dac increased during compared to the increase was primarily due to in force business growth  partially offset by decreased amortization from lower gross margins on variable annuities and certain fixed annuities 
net dac unlocking totaled million and million in and we performed our annual comprehensive evaluation of dac assumptions in the first quarter of and concluded that  due to sustained poor performance of the equity markets coupled with an expectation of moderate future performance due to continuing weakness in the us economy and uncertainty in the geopolitical environment  it was no longer reasonably possible that variable annuity fund returns would revert to the expected long term mean within the time horizon used in our reversion to the mean model

the amortization of dac for interest sensitive life  variable annuities and investment contracts is proportionate to the recognition of actual gross profits  which include realized capital gains and losses

we continuously monitor the creditworthiness of reinsurers in order to determine our risk of recoverability on an individual and aggregate basis  and a provision for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded if needed 
no amounts have been deemed unrecoverable in the three years ended december  we enter into certain inter company reinsurance transactions for the allstate financial operations in order to maintain underwriting control and manage insurance risk among various legal entities 
these reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities 
all significant inter company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
allstate financial outlook our ability to grow our investment margin depends upon maintaining sufficient spreads between investment yields and interest crediting rates  and growing the amount of business in force 
as interest rates rise  we expect a gradual increase in investment yields 
the amount by which these higher yields will increase our investment margin depends upon the amount and pace at which we reset interest crediting rates  which could be influenced by market conditions and the actions of our policyholders 
a significant and sudden increase in interest rates could cause policyholders to exercise surrender provisions in their policies that might cause investment margins to decline 
as a result  growth in our investment margin from net new business activity could be partially offset by compression in our in force investment margins 
if equity markets perform at historical norms  we expect to see positive growth in our variable annuity gross margins from increased revenue 
however  improvements or deteriorations in our variable annuity gross margins from changes in equity market performance or policyholder retention creates a proportional increase or decrease in amortization of variable annuity dac  which will offset a significant portion of the changes in gross margins 
market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase 
to eliminate some of these market concerns  we are expecting to retain more of our term life insurance mortality risk in this change will not have a discernable effect on our net income in the short term  but will provide the foundation to drive increased long term growth in our life insurance business 
our mortality margins will also be more volatile in the future as we retain and manage more of our mortality risk  which will require increased statutory capital 
investments an important component of our financial results is the return on our investment portfolios 
investment portfolios are segmented between the property liability  allstate financial and corporate and other operations 
the investment portfolios are managed based upon the nature of each respective business and its corresponding liability structure 
overview and strategy the property liability portfolio s investment strategy emphasizes safety of principal and consistent income generation  within a total return framework 
this approach  which has produced competitive returns over time  is designed to ensure financial strength and stability for paying claims  while maximizing economic value and surplus growth 
we employ a strategic asset allocation model  which takes into account the nature of the liabilities and risk tolerances  as well as the risk return parameters of the various asset classes in which we invest 
the model s recommended asset allocation  along with duration and liquidity considerations  guides our initial asset allocation 
this is further adjusted based on our analysis of relative value opportunities in different markets 
as part of our total return framework  we may sell securities during the period in which fair value has declined below amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities 
portfolio performance is measured against outside benchmarks at target allocation weights 
portfolio reviews  which include identifying securities that are other than temporarily impaired  are conducted regularly 
for more information  see the portfolio monitoring section of the md a 
the allstate financial portfolio s investment strategy focuses on the need for risk adjusted spread on the underlying liabilities while maximizing return on capital 
we believe investment spread is maximized by selecting assets that perform favorably on a long term basis and by disposing of certain assets to minimize the effect of downgrades and defaults 
we believe this strategy maintains the investment margin necessary to sustain income over time 
the portfolio management approach employs a combination of recognized market  analytical and proprietary modeling  including a strategic asset allocation model  as the primary basis for the allocation of interest sensitive  illiquid and credit assets as well as for determining overall below investment grade exposure and diversification requirements 
within the targets set by the strategic asset allocation model  tactical investment decisions are made in consideration of prevailing market conditions 
portfolio reviews  which include identifying securities that are other than temporarily impaired  are conducted regularly

total investments increased to billion at december  from billion at december   primarily due to positive cash flows from operating and financing activities and increased funds associated with securities lending 
the property liability investment portfolio increased to billion at december  from billion at december   due to positive cash flows from operating activities  partially offset by dividends paid by aic to the allstate corporation and decreased net unrealized gains on fixed income securities 
the allstate financial investment portfolio increased to billion at december   from billion at december   primarily due to positive cash flows from operating and financing activities and increased funds associated with securities lending 
the corporate and other investment portfolio increased to billion at december   from billion at december  this increase primarily reflects additional investments made in the portfolio of kennett capital  inc kennett capital  a wholly owned subsidiary of the allstate corporation 
total investments at amortized cost related to collateral  primarily due to securities lending  increased to billion at december   from billion at december  we use different methodologies to estimate the fair value of publicly and non publicly traded marketable investment securities and exchange traded and non exchange traded derivative contracts 
for a discussion of these methods  see the application of critical accounting policies section of the md a

the municipal bond portfolio at december  consisted of approximately  issues from approximately  issuers 
the largest exposure to a single issuer was less than of the municipal bond portfolio 
corporate entities were the ultimate obligors of approximately of the municipal bond portfolio 
corporate bonds totaled billion and were rated investment grade at december  as of december   the portfolio contained billion of privately placed corporate obligations  of the total corporate obligations in the portfolio  compared with billion at december  approximately billion or of the privately placed corporate obligations consisted of fixed rate privately placed securities 
the benefits of fixed rate privately placed securities when compared to publicly issued securities are generally higher yields  improved cash flow predictability through pro rata sinking funds  and a combination of covenant and call protection features designed to better protect the holder against losses resulting from credit deterioration  reinvestment risk or fluctuations in interest rates 
a disadvantage of fixed rate privately placed securities when compared to publicly issued securities is relatively reduced liquidity 
at december   of the privately placed securities were rated investment grade 
foreign government securities totaled billion and were rated investment grade at december  mortgage backed securities mbs totaled billion at december   substantially all of which were investment grade 
in our mbs portfolio  the credit risk associated with mbs is mitigated due to the fact that the portfolio consists primarily of securities that were issued by  or have underlying collateral that is guaranteed by  us government agencies or us government sponsored entities 
the mbs portfolio is subject to interest rate risk since price volatility and the ultimate realized yield are affected by the rate of prepayment of the underlying mortgages 
the current consistently low interest rate environment has resulted in prepayments  which have eroded the prepayment protection in this portfolio over recent years 
commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs totaled billion at december  cmbs positions primarily represent pools of commercial mortgages  broadly diversified across property types and geographical area 
the cmbs portfolio is subject to credit risk  but unlike other structured products  is generally not subject to prepayment risk 
due to protections within the underlying commercial mortgages  borrowers are restricted from prepaying their mortgages due to changes in interest rates 
credit defaults can result in credit directed prepayments 
approximately of the cmbs portfolio had a moody s rating of aaa or a standard poor s rating of aaa  the highest rating category  at december  asset backed securities abs totaled billion at december  our abs portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risk 
credit risk is managed by monitoring the performance of the collateral 
in addition  many of the securities in the abs portfolio are credit enhanced with features such as over collateralization  subordinated debt  reserve funds  guarantees and or insurance 
approximately of the abs portfolio had a moody s rating of aaa or a standard poor s s p rating of aaa  the highest rating category 
a portion of the abs portfolio is also subject to interest rate risk since  for example  price volatility and ultimate realized yield are affected by the rate of prepayment of the underlying assets 
the abs portfolio includes collateralized debt obligations and other bonds that are secured by a variety of asset types  predominately credit card receivables  home equity loans  and auto loans 
at december   of the consolidated fixed income securities portfolio was rated investment grade  which is defined as a security having a rating from the national association of insurance commissioners naic of or  a rating of aaa  aa  a or baa from moody s or a rating of aaa  aa  a or bbb from s p  fitch or dominion  or a comparable internal rating if an externally provided rating is not available

approximately million of the total gross unrealized losses in the corporate fixed income portfolio and million of the total gross unrealized losses in the asset backed securities portfolio were associated with the airline industry for which values were generally depressed due to company specific issues and economic issues primarily related to fuel and labor costs 
we expect eventual recovery of these securities 
every security was included in our portfolio monitoring process 
the following table shows the composition by credit quality of the fixed income securities with gross unrealized losses at december  naic rating moody s equivalent unrealized loss percent to total fair value percent to total in millions aaa aa a  baa  ba b caa or lower in or near default total  the table above includes redeemable preferred securities with a fair value of million and an unrealized loss of million 
it also includes securities that have not yet received an naic rating  for which we have assigned a comparable internal rating  with a fair value totaling million and an unrealized loss of million 
due to lags between the funding of an investment  processing of final legal documents  filing with the securities valuation office of the naic svo  and rating by the svo  we will always have a small number of securities that have a pending rating 
at december   million  or  of the gross unrealized losses were related to investment grade fixed income securities 
unrealized losses on investment grade securities principally relate to changes in interest rates or changes in sector related credit spreads since the securities were acquired 
as of december   million of the gross unrealized losses were related to below investment grade fixed income securities 
of this amount  were in a significant unrealized loss position greater than or equal to of amortized cost for six or more consecutive months prior to december  included among the securities rated below investment grade are both public and privately placed high yield bonds and securities that were investment grade when originally acquired 
we mitigate the credit risk of investing in below investment grade fixed income securities by limiting the percentage of our fixed income portfolio invested in such securities  through diversification of the portfolio  and active credit monitoring and portfolio management 
the scheduled maturity dates for fixed income securities in an unrealized loss position at december  is shown below 
actual maturities may differ from those scheduled as a result of prepayments by the issuers 
in millions unrealized loss percent to total fair value percent to total due in one year or less due after one year through five years  due after five years through ten years  due after ten years  mortgage and asset backed securities  total  because of the potential for prepayment  mortgage and asset backed securities are not categorized based on their contractual maturities

we expect eventual recovery of these securities 
we included every security in our portfolio monitoring process 
portfolio monitoring we have a comprehensive portfolio monitoring process to identify and evaluate fixed income and equity securities whose carrying value may be other than temporarily impaired 
the process includes a quarterly review of all securities using a screening process to identify those securities whose fair value compared to amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities is below established thresholds for certain time periods  or which are identified through other monitoring criteria such as ratings downgrades or payment defaults 
the securities identified  in addition to other securities for which we may have a concern  are evaluated based on facts and circumstances for inclusion on our watch list 
the watch list is reviewed in detail to determine whether any other than temporary impairment exists 
the following table summarizes fixed income and equity securities in a gross unrealized loss position according to significance  aging and investment grade classification

the largest individual unrealized loss was million for category i  million for category ii  million for category iii and million for category iv as of december  categories i and ii have generally been adversely affected by overall economic conditions including interest rate changes and the market s evaluation of certain sectors 
the degree to which and or length of time that the securities have been in an unrealized loss position does not suggest that these securities pose a high risk of being other than temporarily impaired 
categories iii and iv have primarily been adversely affected by industry and issue specific conditions 
all of the securities in these categories are monitored for impairment 
we expect that the fair values of these securities will recover over time 
whenever our initial analysis indicates that a fixed income security s unrealized loss of or more for at least months or any equity security s unrealized loss of or more for at least months is temporary  additional evaluations and management approvals are required to substantiate that a write down is not appropriate 
as of december   no securities met these criteria 
the following table contains the individual securities with the largest unrealized losses as of december  no other fixed income or equity security had an unrealized loss greater than million or of the total unrealized loss on fixed income and equity securities

problem fixed income securities are securities in default with respect to principal or interest and or securities issued by companies that have gone into bankruptcy subsequent to our acquisition of the security 
restructured fixed income securities have rates and terms that are not consistent with market rates or terms prevailing at the time of the restructuring 
potential problem fixed income securities are current with respect to contractual principal and or interest  but because of other facts and circumstances  we have concerns regarding the borrower s ability to pay future principal and interest  which causes us to believe these securities may be classified as problem or restructured in the future 
the following table summarizes problem  restructured and potential problem fixed income securities at december in millions amortized cost fair value percent of total fixed income portfolio amortized cost fair value percent of total fixed income portfolio problem restructured potential problem total net carrying value cumulative write downs recognized we have experienced a decrease in the amortized cost of fixed income securities in all categories as of december  compared to december  the decreases were primarily related to prepayments by issuers  sales in these categories due to specific developments causing a change in our outlook and intent to hold those securities  and an improvement in the outlook for these securities 
we also evaluated each of these securities through our portfolio monitoring process at december  and recorded write downs when appropriate 
we further concluded that any remaining unrealized losses on these securities were temporary in nature 
while these balances may increase in the future  particularly if economic conditions are unfavorable  management expects that the total amount of securities in these categories will remain low relative to the total fixed income securities portfolio 
net realized capital gains and losses the following table presents the components of realized capital gains and losses and the related tax effect for the years ended december in millions investment write downs dispositions valuation of derivative instruments settlement of derivative instruments realized capital gains and losses  pretax income tax expense benefit realized capital gains and losses  after tax gains from dispositions during include million of net capital gains from a repositioning of the equity portfolio and million of net capital gains from the liquidation of the allstate floridian insurance company portfolio in anticipation of liquidity needs to settle hurricane catastrophe claims 
investment write downs during represented approximately of the average total investment portfolio value during the year 
included in losses from written down investments were million related to airline industry holdings 
for the year ended december   the million in net gains from sales was comprised of gross gains of billion and gross losses of million 
gross losses from sales of fixed income and equity securities combined with investment write downs on fixed income and equity securities of million  represented total gross realized losses of million 
of the million in gross losses from sales of fixed income and equity securities  million resulted from sales of fixed income securities and million resulted from sales of equity securities 
dispositions in the above table include sales and other transactions such as calls and prepayments 
we may sell securities during the period in which fair value has declined below amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities 
in certain situations new factors such as negative developments  subsequent credit deterioration  relative value opportunities  market liquidity concerns and portfolio reallocations can subsequently change our previous intent to continue holding a security 
a changing interest rate environment will also drive changes in our portfolio duration targets at a tactical level 
a duration target and range is established with an economic view of liabilities relative to a long term portfolio view 
tactical duration adjustments within management s approved ranges are accomplished through both cash market transactions and derivative activities that generate realized gains and losses 
as a component of our approach to managing portfolio duration  realized gains and losses on futures are most appropriately considered in conjunction with the unrealized gains and losses on the property liability fixed income portfolio 
this approach mitigates the impacts of general interest rate changes to the overall financial condition of the corporation 
the ten largest losses from sales of individual securities for the year ended december  totaled million with the largest being million and the smallest being million 
none of the million related to securities that were in an unrealized loss position greater than or equal to of amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities for a period of six or more consecutive months prior to sale 
our largest aggregate loss on sales and writedowns are shown in the following table by issuer and its affiliates 
no other issuer together with its affiliates had an aggregated loss on sales and writedowns greater than of the total gross loss on sales and writedowns on fixed income and equity securities 
we have also included in this table the related circumstances giving rise to the losses and a discussion of how those circumstances may have affected other material investments held

valuations in the industry continue to be under stress 
a foreign company with operations related to infrastructure projects  including rail renewal and road design and construction 
a leading developer of software products used in the design and manufacturing of semiconductor devices 
the combination of a faltering business cycle and less than expected product renewals caused results to fall significantly short of expectations 
the position was liquidated at a loss 
total holdings include fixed income securities at amortized cost or equity securities at cost 
the circumstances of the above losses are considered to be company specific and are not expected to have an effect on other holdings in our portfolios 
mortgage loans our mortgage loans portfolio which is primarily held in the allstate financial portfolio was billion at december  and billion at december   and comprised primarily of loans secured by first mortgages on developed commercial real estate 
geographical and property type diversification are key considerations used to manage our mortgage loan risk 
we closely monitor our commercial mortgage loan portfolio on a loan by loan basis 
loans with an estimated collateral value less than the loan balance  as well as loans with other characteristics indicative of higher than normal credit risk  are reviewed by financial and investment management at least quarterly for purposes of establishing valuation allowances and placing loans on non accrual status 
the underlying collateral values are based upon either discounted property cash flow projections or a commonly used valuation method that utilizes a one year projection of expected annual income divided by an expected rate of return 
we had net realized capital losses related to write downs on mortgage loans of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
short term investments our short term investment portfolio was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
we invest available cash balances primarily in taxable short term securities having a final maturity date or redemption date of less than one year 
we also participate in securities lending  primarily as an investment yield enhancement  with third parties such as brokerage firms 
we obtain collateral in an amount equal to and of the fair value of domestic and foreign securities  respectively  and monitor the market value of the securities loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral obtained as necessary 
the cash we receive is invested in short term and fixed income investments  and an offsetting liability is recorded in other liabilities 
at december   the amount of securities lending collateral reinvested in short term investments had a carrying value of billion 
this compares to million at december  market risk market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in equity  interest  commodity  or currency exchange rates and prices 
our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates and equity prices  although we also have a smaller exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the active management of market risk is integral to our results of operations 
we may use the following approaches to manage exposure to market risk within defined tolerance ranges rebalancing existing asset or liability portfolios  changing the character of investments purchased in the future and using derivative instruments to modify the market risk characteristics of existing assets and liabilities or assets expected to be purchased 
for a more detailed discussion of our use of derivative financial instruments  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
overview we generate substantial investable funds from our property liability and allstate financial businesses 
in formulating and implementing guidelines for investing funds  we seek to earn returns that enhance our ability to offer competitive rates and prices to customers while contributing to attractive and stable profits and long term capital growth 
accordingly  our investment decisions and objectives are a function of the underlying risks and product profiles of each business 
investment policies define the overall framework for managing market and other investment risks  including accountability and control over risk management activities 
subsidiaries that conduct investment activities follow policies that have been approved by their respective boards of directors 
these investment policies specify the investment limits and strategies that are appropriate given the liquidity  surplus  product profile and regulatory requirements of the subsidiary 
these activities are conducted primarily through subsidiaries boards of directors and investment committees 
for allstate financial  the asset liability management alm policy guidelines further define the overall asset liability framework for managing market and investment risks 
the allstate financial alm activities follow asset liability policies that have been approved by their respective boards of directors 
these alm policies specify limits  ranges and targets for investments that best meet allstate financial s business objectives in light of its product liabilities 
we manage our exposure to market risk through the use of asset allocation  duration and value at risk limits  through the use of simulation and  as appropriate  through the use of stress tests 
we have asset allocation limits that place restrictions on the total funds that may be invested within an asset class 
we have duration limits on the property liability and allstate financial investment portfolios and  as appropriate  on individual components of these portfolios 
these duration limits place restrictions on the amount of interest rate risk that may be taken 
our value at risk limits restrict the potential loss in fair value that could arise from adverse movements in the fixed income  equity  and currency markets based on historical volatilities and correlations among market risk factors 
comprehensive day to day management of market risk within defined tolerance ranges occurs as portfolio managers buy and sell within their respective markets based upon the acceptable boundaries established by investment policies 
for allstate financial  this day to day management is integrated within the day to day activities of the alm function 
one result of this work is the development and implementation of an asset allocation strategy for optimizing allstate financial s investment income 
although we apply a common overall philosophy to market risk  the underlying business frameworks and the accounting and regulatory environments differ considerably between the property liability and allstate financial businesses affecting investment decisions and risk parameters 
interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur a loss due to adverse changes in interest rates 
this risk arises from many of our primary activities  as we invest substantial funds in interest sensitive assets and issue interest sensitive liabilities  primarily in our allstate financial operations 
we manage the interest rate risk in our assets relative to the interest rate risk in our liabilities 
one of the measures used to quantify this exposure is duration 
duration measures the price sensitivity of the assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates 
for example  if interest rates increase basis points  the fair value of an asset exhibiting a duration of is expected to decrease in value by approximately 
at december   the difference between our asset and liability duration was approximately  compared to a gap at december  a positive duration gap indicates that the fair value of our assets is more sensitive to interest rate movements than the fair value of our liabilities 
most of our duration gap originates from the property liability operations  with the primary liabilities being auto and homeowners claims 
in the management of investments supporting the property liability business  we adhere to an objective of emphasizing safety of principal and consistency of income within a total return framework 
this approach is designed to ensure our financial strength and stability for paying claims  while maximizing economic value and surplus growth 
this objective generally results in a positive duration mismatch between the property liability assets and liabilities 
for the allstate financial business  we seek to invest premiums  contract charges and deposits to generate future cash flows that will fund future claims  benefits and expenses  and that will earn stable margins across a wide variety of interest rate and economic scenarios 
in order to achieve this objective and limit interest rate risk for allstate financial  we adhere to a philosophy of managing the duration of assets and related liabilities 
this philosophy may include using interest rate swaps  futures  forwards  caps and floors to reduce the interest rate risk resulting from mismatches between existing assets and liabilities  and financial futures and other derivative instruments to hedge the interest rate risk of anticipated purchases and sales of investments and product sales to customers 
we pledge and receive collateral on certain types of derivative contracts 
for futures and option contracts traded on exchanges  we have pledged securities as margin deposits totaling million as of december  for over the counter derivative transactions involving interest rate swaps  foreign currency swaps  interest rate caps  interest rate floor agreements  and credit default swaps  master netting agreements are used 
these agreements allow us to net payments due for transactions covered by the agreements  and when applicable  we are required to post collateral 
as of december   we had posted million of securities  while counterparties pledged million of cash as collateral for over the counter instruments 
to calculate the duration gap between assets and liabilities  we project asset and liability cash flows and calculate their net present value using a risk free market interest rate adjusted for credit quality  sector attributes  liquidity and other specific risks 
duration is calculated by revaluing these cash flows at alternative interest rates and determining the percentage change in aggregate fair value 
the cash flows used in this calculation include the expected maturity and repricing characteristics of our derivative financial instruments  all other financial instruments as described in note of the consolidated financial statements  and certain other items including unearned premiums  property liability claims and claims expense reserves  interest sensitive liabilities and annuity liabilities 
the projections include assumptions based upon historical market experience and our experience that reflect the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment  lapse  leverage and or option features of instruments  where applicable 
such assumptions relate primarily to mortgage backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations  municipal housing bonds  callable municipal and corporate obligations  and fixed rate single and flexible premium deferred annuities 
additionally  the calculations include assumptions regarding the renewal of property liability policies 
based upon the information and assumptions we use in this duration calculation  and interest rates in effect at december   we estimate that a basis point immediate  parallel increase in interest rates rate shock would decrease the net fair value of the assets and liabilities by approximately billion  compared to billion at december  additionally  there are billion of assets supporting life insurance products such as traditional and interest sensitive life that are not financial instruments and as a result have not been included in the above estimate 
this amount has increased from the billion reported at december  due to increases in policies in force 
based on assumptions described above  in the event of a basis point immediate increase in interest rates  these assets would decrease in value by million  compared to a decrease of million at december  also reflected in the duration calculation are the effects of a program that uses short futures to manage the property liability interest rate risk exposures relative to duration targets 
based on contracts in place at december   we would recognize realized capital gains totaling million in the event of a basis point immediate  parallel interest rate increase and million in realized capital losses in the event of a basis point immediate  parallel interest rate decrease 
the selection of a basis point immediate parallel change in interest rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event 
to the extent that conditions differ from the assumptions we used in these calculations  duration and rate shock measures could be significantly impacted 
additionally  our calculations assume that the current relationship between short term and long term interest rates the term structure of interest rates will remain constant over time 
as a result  these calculations may not fully capture the effect of non parallel changes in the term structure of interest rates and or large changes in interest rates 
equity price risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in the general levels of the equity markets 
at december   we held approximately billion in common stocks and billion in other securities with equity risk including primarily convertible securities  limited partnership funds and non redeemable preferred securities  compared to approximately billion in common stocks and billion in other equity investments at december  approximately and of these totals  respectively  represented assets of the property liability operations at december   compared to approximately and  respectively  at december  at december   our portfolio of equity investments had a beta of approximately  compared to a beta of approximately at december  beta represents a widely used methodology to describe  quantitatively  an investment s market risk characteristics relative to the standard poor s composite price index s p 
based on the beta analysis  we estimate that if the s p decreases by  the fair value of our equity investments will decrease by approximately 
likewise  we estimate that if the s p increases by  the fair value of our equity investments will increase by approximately 
based upon the information and assumptions we used to calculate beta at december   we estimate that an immediate decrease in the s p of would decrease the net fair value of our equity investments identified above by approximately million  compared to million at december  the selection of a immediate decrease in the s p should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event 
the beta of our equity investments was determined by comparing the monthly total returns of the equity investments to monthly total returns of the s p over a three year historical period 
since beta is historically based  projecting future price volatility using this method involves an inherent assumption that historical volatility and correlation relationships between stocks will not change in the future 
therefore  the illustrations noted above may not reflect our actual experience if future volatility and correlation relationships differ from the historical relationships 
at december  and  we had separate accounts assets related to variable annuity and variable life contracts with account values totaling billion and billion  respectively 
we earn contract charges as a percentage of these account values 
in the event of an immediate decline of in the account values due to equity market declines  we would have earned approximately million and million less in fee income at december  and december   respectively 
variable annuity contracts sold by allstate financial have a gmdb and customers may choose to purchase an enhanced gmdb  guaranteed minimum income benefits gmib prior to  a truereturn sm guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit gmab beginning in  and beginning in  a sureincome sm guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit gmwb 
these guarantees subject us to additional equity market risk because the beneficiary or contractholder may receive a benefit that is greater than their corresponding account value 
gmdbs are payable upon death 
gmibs may be exercised on or after the tenth year anniversary not prior to of the contract if the contractholder elects to receive a defined stream of payments annuitize 
gmabs are credited to the contractholder account on a contract anniversary date that is pre determined by the contractholder  between the eighth and twentieth year after contract issue not prior to 
gmabs guarantee an account value of up to times or of the amount deposited in the contract  depending on the amount of time the contract is in force and adherence to certain fund allocation requirements 
gmwbs will be payable if the contractholder elects to take partial withdrawals 
gmwbs guarantee that the contractholder can take annual partial withdrawals up to of the amount deposited in the contract until their withdrawals total the initial deposit 
in january  we established reserves for gmdbs and gmibs in conjunction with the adoption of sop because of this change in accounting  guarantee payments will be recognized overfuture periods rather than expensed as paid 
for more details see notes and of the consolidated financial statements 
at december  and  the guaranteed value of the death benefits in excess of account values was estimated to be billion and billion  respectively  net of reinsurance 
the decrease in this estimate between periods is attributable to improved equity markets during and customer surrenders of contracts with in the money gmdbs 
in both periods  approximately two thirds of this exposure is related to the return of deposits guarantee  while the remaining one third is attributable to a death benefit guarantee greater than the original deposits 
in addition to reinsurance for a portion of these benefits  we entered into various derivative instruments beginning in to offset the risk of future death claims on substantially all new business issued on or after january  a similar program for gmabs was established in and a similar program for gmwbs will be established in in the event of an immediate decline in account values of due to equity market declines  payments for guaranteed death benefits at december  would increase by an estimated million in these payments would be charged against the related reserve rather than directly to earnings as paid 
contributions to the reserve for gmdbs would be reduced by approximately million in in the event of an immediate decline in account values 
for discussion of the accounting treatment  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
the selection of a immediate decrease should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an example to illustrate the potential effect on earnings and cash flow of equity market declines as a result of this guarantee 
also  our actual payment experience in the future may not be consistent with the assumptions used in the model 
gmib contracts that we sold provide the contractholder with the right to annuitize based on the highest account value at any anniversary date or on a guaranteed earnings rate based on the initial account value over the specified period 
the guaranteed income benefit feature was first offered in our variably annuity products beginning in  with guaranteed benefits available for election by contractholders ten years after issue 
accordingly  the earliest date at which benefits would become payable is in the event of an immediate decline of in contractholders account values as of december  due to equity market declines  contributions to the reserve would be reduced by a nominal amount in for discussion of the accounting treatment  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
the selection of a immediate decrease should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an example to illustrate the potential effect on earnings and cash flow of equity market declines as a result of this guarantee 
in the event of an immediate decline of in gmab contractholders account values as of december   due to equity market declines  there would be no net impact on our earnings because these benefits are fully hedged  however the reserve for gmabs would be increased by approximately million 
in addition to our gmdb  gmib and gmab equity risk  at december  and we had approximately billion and billion  respectively  in equity indexed annuity liabilities that provide customers with interest crediting rates based on the performance of the s p we hedge the equity risk associated with these liabilities through the purchase and sale of equity indexed options and futures  swap futures  and eurodollar futures  maintaining risk within specified value at risk limits 
allstate financial also is exposed to equity risk in dac 
fluctuations in the value of the variable annuity and life contract account values due to the equity market affect dac amortization  because the expected fee income and guaranteed benefits payable are components of the egp for variable annuity and life contracts 
for a more detailed discussion of dac  see note of the consolidated financial statements and the application of critical accounting policies section of the md a 
foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
this risk primarily arises from our foreign equity investments  including real estate funds and our canadian operations 
we also have funding agreement programs and a small amount of fixed income securities that are denominated in foreign currencies  but we use derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk of these funding agreements and securities 
at december  and  we had approximately billion and billion  respectively  in funding agreements denominated in foreign currencies 
at december   we had approximately million in foreign currency denominated equity securities and an additional million net investment in our canadian subsidiaries 
these amounts were million and million  respectively  at december  the foreign currency exposure is almost entirely in the property liability business 
based upon the information and assumptions we used at december   we estimate that a immediate unfavorable change in each of the foreign currency exchange rates that we are exposed to would decrease the value of our foreign currency denominated instruments by approximately million  compared with an estimated million decrease at december  the selection of a immediate decrease in all currency exchange rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event 
our currency exposure is diversified across countries  compared to countries at december  our largest individual currency exchange exposures at december  were to the canadian dollar and the british pound 
the largest individual currency exchange exposures at december  were to the canadian dollar and the british pound 
our primary regional exposure is to western europe  approximately at december   compared to at december  the modeling technique we use to report our currency exposure does not take into account correlation among foreign currency exchange rates 
even though we believe it is very unlikely that all of the foreign currency exchange rates that we are exposed to would simultaneously decrease by  we nonetheless stress test our portfolio under this and other hypothetical extreme adverse market scenarios 
our actual experience may differ from these results because of assumptions we have used or because significant liquidity and market events could occur that we did not foresee 
pension plans we have defined benefit pension plans  which cover most full time and certain part time employees and employee agents 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of these plans and their effect on the consolidated financial statements 
net periodic pension cost in is estimated to be million based on current assumptions 
net periodic pension cost increased in and principally due to unfavorable returns on plan assets  decreases in the weighted average discount rate assumption which is based on long term interest rates  and  in  a decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
in each of the years  and  net pension cost included non cash settlement charges primarily resulting from lump sum distributions made to agents 
settlement charges are expected to continue in the future as we settle our remaining agent pension obligations by making lump sum distributions to agents 
as provided for in statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  the market related value component of expected returns recognizes plan equity losses and gains over a five year period  which we believe is consistent with the long term nature of pension obligations 
as a result  the effect of changes in fair value on our net periodic pension cost may be experienced in periods subsequent to those in which the fluctuations actually occur 
amounts recorded for pension cost and minimum pension liabilities are significantly affected by fluctuations in the returns on plan assets and the amortization of unrecognized actuarial gains and losses 
plan assets sustained net losses in primarily due to the decline in the equity markets 
these asset losses  combined with all other unrecognized actuarial gains and losses  resulted in amortization of net actuarial loss and additional net periodic pension cost of million in and million in we anticipate that the unrealized loss for our pension plans will exceed of the greater of the projected benefit obligations or the market related value of assets during the foreseeable future  resulting in additional amortization and net periodic pension cost 
amounts recorded for net periodic pension cost and minimum pension liabilities are also significantly affected by changes in the assumptions used to determine the weighted average discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the weighted average discount rate is based on rates at which expected pension benefits attributable to past employee service could effectively be settled on a present value basis at the measurement date 
we develop the assumed weighted average discount rate by utilizing the weighted average yield of a theoretical dedicated portfolio derived from bonds available in the lehman corporate bond universe having ratings of at least aa by standard poor s or at least aa by moody s on the measurement date with cash flows that match expected plan benefit requirements 
significant changes in discount rates  such as those caused by changes in the yield curve  the mix of bonds available in the market  the duration of selected bonds and expected benefit payments  may result in volatility in pension cost and minimum pension liabilities 
holding other assumptions constant  a hypothetical decrease of basis points in the weighted average discount rate would result in an increase of million in net periodic pension cost and an million increase in the minimum pension liability after tax as of october   our most recent measurement date  versus an increase of million in net periodic pension cost and a million increase in the minimum pension liability after tax as of october  a hypothetical increase of basis points in the weighted average discount rate would decrease net periodic pension cost by million and would decrease the minimum pension liability after tax by million as of october   versus a decrease in net periodic pension cost of million and a million decrease in the minimum pension liability after tax as of october  this non symmetrical range results from the non linear relationship between discount rates and pension obligations  and changes in the amortization of unrealized net actuarial gains and losses 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on plan assets 
while this rate reflects long term assumptions and is consistent with long term historical returns  sustained changes in the market or changes in the mix of plan assets may lead to revisions in the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets that may result in variability of pension cost 
differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets are a component of unrecognized gains or losses  which may be amortized as a component of net actuarial gains and losses 
as a result  the effect of changes in fair value on our pension cost may be experienced in periods subsequent to those in which the fluctuations actually occur 
holding other assumptions constant  a hypothetical decrease of basis points in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in an increase of million in pension cost at october   compared to an increase of million at october  a hypothetical increase of basis points in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in a decrease in net periodic pension cost of million at october   compared to a decrease of million at october  changes in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets do not affect the minimum pension liability 
capital resources and liquidity capital resources consist of shareholders equity and debt  representing funds deployed or available to be deployed to support business operations or for general corporate purposes

shareholders equity increased in when compared to  as net income  unrealized net capital gains on investments and a decrease in the minimum pension liability were partially offset by dividends paid to shareholders and share repurchases 
our billion share repurchase program was completed as of december  commencing in january  we have a new billion share repurchase program which is expected to be completed in treasury stock is a component of shareholders equity and  since  we have repurchased million shares of our common stock at a cost of billion  primarily as part of various stock repurchase programs 
we have reissued million shares since  primarily associated with our equity incentive plans  the acquisition of american heritage life investment corporation ahl and the redemption of certain mandatorily redeemable preferred securities 
debt increased in compared to primarily due to increases in long term borrowings outstanding 
we issued million of senior notes due in  utilizing the registration statement filed with the sec in june the proceeds of this issuance will be used for general corporate purposes  including to facilitate the repayment of a portion of the million of senior notes due at their scheduled maturity on may  we anticipate having adequate sources of liquidity from existing investments and dividends from subsidiaries to repay the remaining portion of the million of senior notes 
the increase in debt was partially offset by a decrease of million related to the deconsolidation of a variable interest entity vie resulting from the sale of a portion of the equity interest in the vie 
for more information on the adoption of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  see notes  and of the consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had outstanding commercial paper borrowings of million with a weighted average interest rate of 
the increase in debt in compared to was primarily due to the adoption of fin and increases in long term borrowings outstanding  partly offset by declines in short term borrowings outstanding 
the adoption of fin  effective july   increased long term debt by billion  including million for the consolidation of two vies to hold assets under the management of an affiliate on behalf of third party investors  million for the consolidation of a vie for a headquarters office building and up to automotive collision repair stores  million for the consolidation of the debt of a previously unconsolidated investment security  and million of the debt we issued to allstate financing ii af ii that is no longer required to be consolidated 
although we were required to consolidate the two vies used to hold assets on behalf of third party investors under fin  we had no legal ownership of the assets and no obligation to repay the debt 
our maximum exposure related to these two entities was the current value of our equity investment  which totaled million at december  moody s and standard and poor s had apprised us that the reported debt associated with the consolidation of these vies would be excluded for analytical purposes from the ratio of debt to shareholders equity for ratings considerations 
this analytical ratio was as of december  in  we issued million of senior notes due in  utilizing the registration statement filed with the sec in the proceeds of this issuance were used to redeem the million of notes due and for general corporate purposes 
mandatorily redeemable preferred securities were eliminated as a separate line item on our consolidated statements of financial position effective july   because of the adoption of fin this accounting guidance required the de consolidation of af ii  a subsidiary that we own  and the recognition of debt pursuant to debentures that we had previously issued to af ii  which are held as collateral for the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities

we have distinct groups of subsidiaries licensed to sell property and casualty insurance in new jersey and florida 
these groups have separate group ratings and are not reinsured by other allstate subsidiaries that are not part of each of these respective groups 
the ratings of the new jersey and florida groups are influenced by the risks noted above as they relate distinctly to each group 
in  am best revised the rating of allstate floridian insurance company allstate floridian and allstate floridian indemnity company from a excellent to b very good 
these ratings remain under review with negative implications as the current risk adjusted capitalization is not supportive of the rating  as a result of a decline in capital of allstate floridian due to hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne 
the resolution of the ratings review will be influenced by developments prior to the hurricane season  including florida regulatory and legislative actions  allstate and allstate floridian management actions  am best s assessment of the timing and nature of such developments and their view on the amount of capital and risk adjusted capitalization deemed necessary to support the ratings 
although at present it is not clear when a ratings decision will be made  it is believed am best will make a ratings decision before the hurricane season 
am best has indicated it is evaluating its methodology for determining the level of capital needed to support property insurance written in areas of hurricane loss exposure in florida 
allstate floridian also has a demotech rating of a the ratio of net premiums written to statutory surplus is a common measure of operating leverage used in the property casualty insurance industry and serves as an indicator of a company s premium growth capacity 
ratios in excess of to are typically considered outside the usual range by insurance regulators and rating agencies 
aic s premium to surplus ratio was x on december  compared to x in the prior year 
state laws specify regulatory actions if an insurer s risk based capital rbc  a measure of an insurer s solvency  falls below certain levels 
the naic has a standard formula for annually assessing rbc 
the formula for calculating rbc for property liability companies takes into account asset and credit risks but places more emphasis on underwriting factors for reserving and pricing 
the formula for calculating rbc for life insurance companies takes into account factors relating to insurance  business  asset and interest rate risks 
at december   the rbc for each of our domestic insurance companies was above levels that would require regulatory actions 
the naic has also developed a set of financial relationships or tests known as the insurance regulatory information system to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies and identifying companies that require special attention or actions by insurance regulatory authorities 
the naic analyzes financial data provided by insurance companies using prescribed ratios  each with defined usual ranges 
generally  regulators will begin to monitor an insurance company if its ratios fall outside the usual ranges for four or more of the ratios 
if an insurance company has insufficient capital  regulators may act to reduce the amount of insurance it can issue 
the ratios of our domestic insurance companies are within these ranges

cash used in investing activities increased in as higher operating cash flows were invested in the fixed income and equity portfolios 
cash flows were impacted by dividends paid by aic to its parent  the allstate corporation  totaling billion  billion and million in  and  respectively 
for a description of limitations on the payment of these dividends  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
allstate financial lower cash flows from operating activities in  compared to  were primarily due to lower premium collections and higher deferrable expenses paid  partially offset by lower policy and contract benefits paid and higher interest received on fixed income securities and mortgage loans 
the lower premium collections were primarily the result of the disposal of substantially all of our direct response distribution business and lower sales of life contingent immediate annuities 
higher operating cash flows of allstate financial in primarily relate to increases in investment income  partially offset by an increase in benefits and acquisition related expenses from new business growth 
cash flows used in investing activities increased in compared to as the investment of higher financing cash flows was partially offset by lower operating cash flow 
cash flows used in investing activities declined in compared to as the investment of higher operating cash flows were offset by lower financing cash flow 
increased cash flows from financing activities in  compared to  were primarily attributable to higher deposits of fixed annuities and institutional products  partially offset by fixed annuity withdrawals and institutional product maturities 
lower cash flow from financing activities during reflect an increase in maturities of institutional products and benefits and withdrawals from contractholders accounts  partially offset by increased deposits received from contractholders 
for quantification of the changes in contractholder funds  see the allstate financial segment section of the md a 
a portion of the allstate financial product portfolio  primarily fixed annuity and interest sensitive life insurance products  is subject to surrender and withdrawal at the discretion of contractholders 
the following table summarizes allstate financial s liabilities for these products by their contractual withdrawal provisions at december  approximately of these liabilities is subject to discretionary withdrawal without adjustment 
in millions not subject to discretionary withdrawal  subject to discretionary withdrawal with adjustments specified surrender charges  market value  subject to discretionary withdrawal without adjustments  total contractholder funds  includes billion of liabilities with a contractual surrender charge of less than of the account balance 
approximately billion of the contracts with market value adjusted surrenders have a day period during which there is no surrender charge or market value adjustment  including approximately billion of market value adjusted annuities with a period commencing during to ensure we have the appropriate level of liquidity in this segment  we perform actuarial tests on the impact to cash flows of policy surrenders and other actions under various scenarios 
depending upon the years in which certain policy types were sold with specific surrender provisions  the allstate financial cash flow could vary due to higher surrender of policies exiting their surrender charge periods 
corporate and other lower operating cash flow of the corporate and other segment in was primarily due to the timing of intercompany settlements 
financing cash flows of the corporate and other segment reflect actions such as fluctuations in short term debt  proceeds from the issuance of debt  dividends to shareholders of the allstate corporation and share repurchases  therefore  financing cash flows are affected when we increase or decrease the level of these activities 
higher uses of cash in investing activities during and reflect additional net investments made in the portfolio of kennett capital  a subsidiary of the allstate corporation 
kennett capital has billion of capital that is available to pay dividends to the allstate corporation  that are not subject to insurance company limitations 
we have established external sources of short term liquidity that include a commercial paper program  lines of credit  dollar rolls and repurchase agreements 
in the aggregate  at december   these sources could provide over billion of additional liquidity 
for additional liquidity  we can also issue new insurance contracts  incur additional debt and sell assets from our investment portfolio 
the liquidity of our investment portfolio varies by type of investment 
for example  billion of privately placed corporate obligations that represent of the investment portfolio  and billion of mortgage loans that represent of the investment portfolio  generally are considered to be less liquid than many of our other types of investments  such as our us government and agencies  municipal and public corporate fixed income security portfolios 
we have access to additional borrowing to support liquidity as follows a commercial paper program with a borrowing limit of billion to cover short term cash needs 
as of december   the remaining borrowing capacity was million  however  the outstanding balance fluctuates daily 
we currently maintain one primary credit facility and one additional credit facility totaling billion to cover short term liquidity requirements 
the primary facility is a billion five year revolving line of credit expiring in it contains an increase provision that would make up to an additional million available for borrowing provided the increased portion could be fully syndicated at a later date among existing or new lenders 
the other facility is a million one year revolving line of credit renewed in july for an additional year 
although the right to borrow under the five year facility is not subject to a minimum rating requirement  the costs of maintaining the five year facility and borrowing under it are based on the ratings of our senior  unsecured  nonguaranteed long term debt 
there were no borrowings under either of these lines of credit during the total amount outstanding at any point in time under the combination of the commercial paper program and the two credit facilities cannot exceed the amount that can be borrowed under the credit facilities 
the right to issue up to an additional billion of debt securities  equity securities  warrants for debt and equity securities  trust preferred securities  stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units utilizing the shelf registration statement filed with the sec in august our only financial covenant exists with respect to our primary credit facility and million of our capital lease obligations 
the covenant requires that we not exceed a debt to capital resources ratio as defined in the agreements 
this ratio at december  was 
we closely monitor and manage our liquidity through long and short term planning that is integrated between the corporation  the business segments and investments 
allstate financial manages the duration of assets and related liabilities through alm  using a dynamic process that addresses liquidity utilizing the investment portfolio  and components of the portfolio as appropriate  which is routinely subjected to stress testing 
allstate protection s underwriting cash transactions comprise millions of small transactions that make it possible to statistically determine reasonable expectations of patterns of liquidity  which are subject to volatility from unpredictable catastrophe losses 
allstate protection monitors the duration of its assets and liabilities and maintains a portfolio of highly liquid fixed income and equity securities  including short term investments  exchange traded common stock  municipal bonds  corporate bonds  and us government and government agency securities in order to address the variability of its cash flows 
discontinued lines and coverages liabilities are expected to be paid over many years and do not present a significant liquidity risk 
allstate financial and allstate protection also have access to funds from our commercial paper program 
certain remote events and circumstances could constrain our liquidity 
those events and circumstances include  for example  a catastrophe resulting in extraordinary losses  a downgrade in our long term debt rating of a and a from moody s and standard poor s  respectively to non investment grade status of below baa bbb  a downgrade in aic s financial strength rating from aa  aa and a from moody s  standard poor s and am best  respectively to below baa bbb a  or a downgrade in alic s financial strength ratings from aa  aa and a from moody s  standard poor s and am best  respectively to below aa aa a 
the rating agencies also consider the interdependence of our individually rated entities  therefore  a rating change in one entity could potentially affect the ratings of other related entities 
contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations as of december  and the payments due by period are shown in the following table 
in millions total less than year years years over years securities lending  dollar rolls  and repurchase agreements   commercial paper contractholder funds     reserve for life contingent contract benefits  long term debt   capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations pension obligations reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense      other liabilities and accrued expenses   total contractual cash obligations    securities lending  dollar rolls and repurchase transactions are typically fully collateralized with marketable securities 
we manage our short term liquidity position to ensure the availability of a sufficient amount of liquid assets to extinguish short term liabilities as they come due in the normal course of business 
contractholder funds represent interest bearing liabilities arising from the sale of products such as interest sensitive life  fixed annuities  including immediate annuities without life contingencies  bank deposits and institutional products 
these amounts reflect estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and contractholders 
certain of these contracts  such as immediate annuities without life contingencies and institutional products  involve payment obligations where the amount and timing of the payment is essentially fixed and determinable 
these amounts relate to i policies or contracts where we are currently making payments and will continue to do so and ii contracts where the timing of payments has been determined by the contract 
other contracts  such as interest sensitive life and fixed deferred annuities  involve payment obligations where the amount and timing of future payments is uncertain 
for these contracts and bank deposits  i the company is not currently making payments and will not make payments until the occurrence of an insurable event  such as death  or ii the occurrence of a payment triggering event  such as the surrender of or partial withdrawal on a policy or deposit contract  which is outside of the control of the company 
we have estimated the timing of payments related to these contracts based on historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns 
uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality  customer lapse and withdrawal activity  and estimated additional deposits for interest sensitive life contracts  which may significantly impact both the timing and amount of future payments 
such cash outflows reflect adjustments for the estimated timing of mortality  retirement  and other appropriate factors  but are undiscounted with respect to interest 
as a result  the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of billion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of billion included in the consolidated statements of financial position as of december  for contractholder funds 
the liability amount in the consolidated statements of financial position reflects the discounting for interest as well as adjustments for the timing of other factors as described above 
the reserve for life contingent contract benefits relates primarily to traditional life and immediate annuities with life contingencies and reflects the present value of estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and contractholders 
immediate annuities with life contingencies include i contracts where we are currently making payments and will continue to do so until the occurrence of a specific event such as death and ii contracts where the timing of a portion of the payments has been determined by the contract 
other contracts  such as traditional life and supplemental accident and health insurance  involve payment obligations where the amount and timing of future payments is uncertain 
for these contracts  i the company is not currently making payments and will not make payments until the occurrence of an insurable event  such as death or illness  or ii the occurrence of a payment triggering event  such as a surrender of a policy or contract  which is outside of the control of the company 
we have estimated the timing of cash outflows related to these contracts based on historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns 
uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality  morbidity  expenses  customer lapse and withdrawal activity  and renewal premium for life policies  which may significantly impact both the timing and amount of future payments 
such cash outflows reflect adjustments for the estimated timing of mortality  retirement  and other appropriate factors  but are undiscounted with respect to interest 
as a result  the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of billion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of billion included in the consolidated statements of financial position as of december  for reserve for life contingent contract benefits 
the liability amount in the consolidated statements of financial position reflects the discounting for interest as well as adjustments for the timing of other factors as described above 
our payment obligations relating to long term debt  capital lease obligations  operating leases  unconditional purchase obligations and pension obligations are managed within the structure of our intermediate to long term liquidity management program 
pension obligations represent approved contributions to our pension plans 
reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims  including claims that have been incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
we have estimated the timing of these payments based on our historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns 
however  the timing of these payments may vary significantly from the amounts shown above  especially for those claims that have been incurred but not reported 
the reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense includes loss reserves related to asbestos and environmental claims as of december   of billion and million  respectively 
other liabilities primarily include accrued expenses and certain benefit obligations and claim payments and other checks outstanding 
certain of these long term liabilities are discounted with respect to interest  as a result the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of billion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of billion 
balance sheet liabilities not included in the table above include unearned and advance premiums of billion and deferred income taxes of million 
these items were excluded as they do not meet the definition of a contractual liability as we are not contractually obligated to pay these amounts to third parties 
rather  they represent an accounting mechanism that allows us to present our financial statements on an accrual basis of accounting 
in addition  other liabilities of billion were not included in the table above because they did not represent a contractual obligation or the amount and timing of their eventual payment was sufficiently uncertain 
our contractual commitments as of december  and the payments due by period are shown in the following table 
in millions total less than year years years over years other commitments conditional other commitments unconditional total commitments  represents investment commitments such as private placements and mortgage loans 
we have agreements in place for services we conduct  generally at cost  between subsidiaries relating to insurance  reinsurance  loans and capitalization 
all material inter company transactions have appropriately been eliminated in consolidation 
inter company transactions among insurance subsidiaries and affiliates have been approved by the appropriate departments of insurance as required 
enterprise risk management risk management is primarily employed within the business unit where the risk resides 
in addition  we have a senior management advisory committee called the enterprise risk council erc 
although the work of the erc is in the early stages  ultimately it will be responsible for assessing risks on an integrated basis across subsidiaries and organizations 
among the risks that the erc will be assessing are catastrophe risk management techniques employed by allstate protection  asset liability management techniques primarily employed by allstate financial  and investment risk  including market risk  credit counterparty risk  liquidity risk  operating risk and derivatives exposure limits employed by our credit risk management committee crmc in our investment organization 
in addition to integrating these elements  other objectives of the erc include assessing evaluating risk capacity impacting multiple organizations aligning risk appetites and strategy linking enterprise growth  risk  and return identifying enterprise risk opportunity sets rationalizing capital we are utilizing for allstate protection an internally developed stochastic model as a significant component in our determination of an appropriate level of economic capital needed  given a defined tolerance for risk 
economic capital modeling capabilities enable us to more fully understand and optimize risk reward tradeoffs across the portfolio of businesses 
the economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature and interaction of the risks inherent in our businesses  and also provides a basis upon which capital may be allocated to each business unit 
future plans include adding to the model similar economic capital evaluations with respect to the allstate financial business unit and our investment operations so that there is a total enterprise perspective 
regulation and legal proceedings we are subject to extensive regulation and we are involved in various legal and regulatory actions  all of which have an effect on specific aspects of our business 
for a detailed discussion of the legal and regulatory actions in which we are involved  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
pending accounting standards as of december   there are several pending and proposed accounting standards that we have not implemented either because the standard has not been finalized or the implementation date has not yet occurred 
for a discussion of these pending and proposed standards  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
the effect of implementing certain accounting standards on our financial results and financial condition is often based in part on market conditions at the time of implementation of the standard and other factors we are unable to determine prior to implementation 
for this reason  we are sometimes unable to estimate the effect of certain pending accounting standards until the relevant authoritative body finalizes these standards or until we implement them 
forward looking statements and risk factors this document contains forward looking statements that anticipate results based on our estimates  assumptions and plans that are subject to uncertainty 
these statements are made subject to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments 
these forward looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and may be identified by their use of words like plans  seeks  expects  will  should  anticipates  estimates  intends  believes  likely  targets and other words with similar meanings 
these statements may address  among other things  our strategy for growth  product development  regulatory approvals  market position  expenses  financial results  litigation and reserves 
we believe that these statements are based on reasonable estimates  assumptions and plans 
however  if the estimates  assumptions or plans underlying the forward looking statements prove inaccurate or if other risks or uncertainties arise  actual results could differ materially from those communicated in these forward looking statements 
factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by such forward looking statements include but are not limited to those discussed or identified in this document including the risks described below and in our public filings with the sec 
in addition to the normal risks of business  we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties  including those listed below  which apply to us as an insurer and a provider of other financial services 
risks relating to the property liability business as a property and casualty insurer  we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events because of the exposure of our property and casualty business to catastrophic events  our operating results and financial condition may vary significantly from one period to the next 
catastrophes can be caused by various natural and man made disasters  including earthquakes  volcanoes  wildfires  tornadoes  hurricanes  tropical storms and terrorism 
while we believe that our natural event catastrophe management initiatives have reduced the potential magnitude of possible future natural event losses  we continue to be exposed to catastrophes that could have a material adverse effect on operating results and financial position 
for example  in we incurred losses of billion  net of recoveries from the fhcf  in connection with a series of four hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne that struck portions of florida  the southeastern seaboard  and other parts of the united states 
in addition  our historical catastrophe experience includes losses relating to hurricane andrew in  totaling billion  and to the northridge earthquake of  totaling billion 
we are also exposed to assessments from the california earthquake authority and various florida state created catastrophe loss management facilities  and to losses that could surpass the capitalization of these facilities 
our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe  or multiple catastrophes  which result in extraordinary losses or a downgrade of our debt or financial strength ratings 
in addition  we are also subject to claims arising from weather events such as winter storms  rain  hail and high winds 
the incidence and severity of weather conditions are inherently unpredictable 
there is generally an increase in the frequency and severity of auto and homeowners claims when severe weather conditions occur 
unanticipated increases in the severity or frequency of claims may adversely affect our profitability changes in the severity or frequency of claims may affect the profitability of our allstate protection segment 
changes in bodily injury claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in the medical sector of the economy 
changes in auto physical damage claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in auto repair costs  auto parts prices and used car prices 
changes in homeowner s claim severity are driven by inflation in the construction industry  in building materials and in home furnishings and by other economic and environmental factors 
however  changes in the level of the severity of claims are not limited to the effects of inflation in these various sectors of the economy 
increases in claim severity can arise from unexpected events that are inherently difficult to predict 
examples of such events include a decision in by the georgia supreme court that diminished value coverage was included in auto policies under georgia law  and the emergence of mold related homeowners losses in the state of texas 
although from time to time we pursue various loss management initiatives in the allstate protection segment in order to mitigate future increases in claim severity  there can be no assurances that these initiatives will successfully identify or reduce the effect of future increases in claim severity 
our allstate protection segment has experienced a decline in claim frequency 
the industry has experienced a similar decline 
we believe that this decrease may be attributable to a combination of several factors  including an increase in the level of policy deductibles chosen by policyholders  a decrease in policyholder submission of claims for minor losses  and our implementation of improved underwriting criteria 
the favorable level of claim frequency we have experienced may not be sustainable over the longer term 
a significant increase in claim frequency could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
actual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims recorded claim reserves in the property liability business are based on our best estimates of losses  both reported and incurred but not reported  after considering known facts and circumstances  internal factors including our experience with similar losses  historical trends involving claim payment patterns  loss payments  pending levels of unpaid claims  loss management programs and product mix 
in addition  reserve estimates are influenced by external factors including changes in regulation  court decisions  economic conditions and public attitudes 
because reserves are estimates of losses that have occurred  including ibnr losses  the establishment of appropriate reserves  including reserves for catastrophes  is an inherently uncertain and complex process 
the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves and such variance may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
predicting claim expense relating to asbestos and other environmental and discontinued lines is inherently uncertain the process of estimating asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines liabilities is complicated by complex legal issues concerning  among other things  the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are  or were ever intended to be  covered  the ability of policyholders to file claims or add claimants to active claims  and whether losses could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium  reinsurance or other contractual agreements 
asbestos related bankruptcies and other asbestos litigations are complex  lengthy proceedings that involve substantial uncertainty for insurers 
while we believe that improved actuarial techniques and databases have assisted in estimating asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines net loss reserves  these refinements may subsequently prove to be inadequate indicators of the extent of probable loss 
consequently  ultimate net losses from these discontinued lines could materially exceed established loss reserves and expected recoveries  and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  operating results and financial position 
regulation limiting rate increases and requiring us to underwrite business and participate in loss sharing arrangements may decrease our profitability from time to time  political events and positions affect the insurance market  including efforts to suppress rates to a level that may not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability 
moreover  because allstate protection s loss ratio currently compares favorably to that of the industry  state regulatory authorities may resist or delay our efforts to raise rates in the future even if the property and casualty industry generally is not experiencing regulatory resistance to rate increases 
such resistance affects our ability in all product lines to obtain approval for rate changes that may be required to achieve targeted levels of profitability and returns on equity 
additionally  homeowners premium growth rates and retention could be adversely impacted by the need to adjust our business structure  size and underwriting practices in florida and other markets with significant catastrophe risk exposure 
in addition to regulating rates  certain states have enacted laws that require a property liability insurer conducting business in that state to participate in assigned risk plans  reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations or require the insurer to offer coverage to all consumers  often restricting an insurer s ability to charge the price it might otherwise charge 
in these markets  we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at lower than desired rates  possibly leading to an unacceptable return on capital 
laws and regulations of many states also limit an insurer s ability to withdraw from one or more lines of insurance in the state  except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department 
additionally  certain states require insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies 
these funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state 
our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of these factors 
the potential benefits of implementing tiered pricing may not be fully realized we believe that tiered pricing and underwriting including srm which  in some situations  considers information that is obtained from credit reports among other factors has allowed us to be more competitive and operate more profitably 
however  because some of our competitors have adopted underwriting criteria and tiered pricing models similar to those we use and because other competitors may follow suit  we may lose our competitive advantage 
further  the use of insurance scoring from information that is obtained from credit reports as a factor in underwriting and pricing has at times been challenged by regulators  legislators  litigants and special interest groups in various states 
competitive pressures could also force us to modify our tiered pricing model 
furthermore  because we have been using tiered pricing only for the last several years  we cannot make assurances that tiered pricing models will accurately reflect the level of losses that we will ultimately incur from the mix of new business generated 
moreover  to the extent that competitive pressures limit our ability to attract new customers  our expectation that the amount of business written using tiered pricing will increase may not be realized 
allstate protection may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business the property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition  less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates  followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition  more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates 
a downturn in the profitability cycle of the property and casualty business could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
risks relating to the allstate financial segment changes in underwriting and actual experience could materially affect profitability our product pricing includes long term assumptions regarding investment returns  mortality  morbidity  persistency and operating costs and expenses of the business 
management establishes target returns for each product based upon these factors and the average amount of regulatory and rating agency capital that the company must hold to support in force contracts 
we monitor and manage our pricing and overall sales mix to achieve target returns on a portfolio basis 
profitability from new business emerges over a period of years depending on the nature and life of the product and is subject to variability as actual results may differ from pricing assumptions 
our profitability in this segment depends on the adequacy of investment margins  the management of market and credit risks associated with investments  our ability to maintain premiums and contract charges at a level adequate to cover mortality and morbidity benefits  the adequacy of contract charges on variable contracts to cover the costs of various product features  the persistency of policies to ensure recovery of acquisition expenses  and the management of operating costs and expenses within anticipated pricing allowances 
legislation and regulation of the insurance marketplace and products could also affect our profitability 
changes in reserve estimates may reduce profitability reserve for life contingent contract benefits is computed on the basis of long term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields  mortality  morbidity  policy terminations and expenses 
we periodically review the adequacy of these reserves on an aggregate basis and if future experience differs significantly from assumptions  adjustments to reserves may be required which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
changes in market interest rates may lead to a significant decrease in the sales and profitability of spread based products our ability to manage the allstate financial investment margin for spread based products is dependent upon maintaining profitable spreads between investment yields and interest crediting rates 
as interest rates decrease or remain at low levels  proceeds from investments that have matured  prepaid or sold may be reinvested at lower yields  reducing investment margin 
lowering interest crediting rates can offset decreases in investment margin on some products 
however  these changes could be limited by market conditions  regulatory or contractual minimum rate guarantees on many contracts and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields 
decreases in the rates offered on products in the financial segment could make those products less attractive  leading to lower sales and or changes in the level of surrenders and withdrawals for these products 
increases in market interest rates can also have negative effects on allstate financial  for example by increasing the attractiveness of other investments  which can lead to higher surrenders at a time when the segment s investment asset values are lower as a result of the increase in interest rates 
for certain products  principally fixed annuity and interest sensitive life products  the earned rate on assets could lag behind market yields 
we may react to market conditions by increasing crediting rates  which could narrow spreads 
unanticipated surrenders could result in dac unlocking or affect the recoverability of dac and thereby increase expenses and reduce profitability 
declining equity markets may reduce both sales of products and income from contract charges and may adversely affect operating results and financial condition conditions in the united states and international stock markets affect the sale and profitability of allstate financial s variable annuities 
in general  sales of variable annuities decrease when stock markets are declining over an extended period of time 
the effect of decreasing separate accounts balances resulting from volatile equity markets  lower underlying fund performance or declining consumer confidence could cause contract charges earned to decrease 
in addition  it is possible that the assumptions and projections we use to establish prices for gmdb  gmib  gmab and gmwb products  particularly assumptions and projections about investment performance  do not accurately reflect the level of costs that we will ultimately incur in providing those benefits  resulting in adverse margin trends 
these factors may result in accelerated dac amortization and require increases in reserves  which would reduce statutory capital and surplus and or allstate financial s net income 
poor fund performance could also result in higher partial withdrawals of account value which  for some contracts  do not reduce the gmdb by a proportional amount 
changes in estimates of profitability on interest sensitive and variable products may have an adverse effect on results through increased amortization of dac dac related to interest sensitive life  variable life and annuity and investment contracts is amortized in proportion to egp over the estimated lives of the contracts 
assumptions underlying egp  including those relating to margins from mortality  investment margin  contract administration  surrender and other contract charges  are updated from time to time in order to reflect actual and expected experience and its potential effect on the valuation of dac 
updates to these assumptions could result in dac unlocking  which in turn could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
a loss of key product distribution relationships could materially affect sales certain products in the allstate financial segment are distributed under agreements with other members of the financial services industry that are not affiliated with us 
termination of one or more of these agreements due to  for example  a change in control of one of these distributors  could have a detrimental effect on the sales of allstate financial 
changes in tax laws may decrease sales and profitability of products under current federal and state income tax law  certain products primarily life insurance and annuities we offer receive favorable tax treatment 
this favorable treatment may give certain of our products a competitive advantage over noninsurance products 
congress from time to time considers legislation that would reduce or eliminate the favorable policyholder tax treatment currently applicable to life insurance and annuities 
congress also considers proposals to reduce the taxation of certain products or investments that may compete with life insurance and annuities 
legislation that increases the taxation on insurance products or reduces the taxation on competing products could lessen the advantage of certain of our products as compared to competing products 
such proposals  if adopted  could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or ability to sell such products and could result in the surrender of some existing contracts and policies 
in addition  changes in the federal estate tax laws have negatively affected the demand for the types of life insurance used in estate planning 
risks relating to the insurance industry our future results are dependent in part on our ability to successfully operate in an insurance industry that is highly competitive the insurance industry is highly competitive 
our competitors include other insurers and  because many of our products include a savings or investment component  securities firms  investment advisers  mutual funds  banks and other financial institutions 
many of our competitors have well established national reputations and market similar insurance products 
because of the competitive nature of the insurance industry  including competition for producers such as exclusive and independent agents  there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals  or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
the ability of banks to affiliate with insurers may have a material adverse effect on all of our product lines by substantially increasing the number  size and financial strength of potential competitors 
furthermore  certain competitors operate using a mutual insurance company structure and therefore  may have dissimilar profitability and return targets 
we are subject to market risk and so changing interest rates and declines in credit quality may have adverse effects because we have large investment portfolios  we are subject to market risk  the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in equity  interest  commodity or foreign currency exchange rates and prices 
our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates and equity prices and  to a lesser degree  changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
for additional information on market risk  see the market risk section of md a 
a decline in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on our investment income as we invest cash in new investments that may yield less than the portfolio s average rate 
in a declining interest rate environment  borrowers may prepay or redeem securities we hold more quickly than expected as they seek to refinance at lower rates 
a decline could also cause the purchase of longer term assets in order to obtain adequate investment yields resulting in a duration gap when compared to the duration of liabilities 
an increase in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio  for example  by decreasing the fair values of the fixed income securities that comprise a substantial majority of our investment portfolio 
increases in interest rates also may lead to an increase in policy loans  surrenders and withdrawals that generally would be funded at a time when fair values of fixed income securities are lower 
a decline in the quality of our investment portfolio as a result of adverse economic conditions or otherwise could cause additional realized losses on securities  including realized losses relating to derivative strategies not adequately addressing portfolio risks 
a declining market could also cause the investments in our pension plans to decrease below the accumulated benefit obligation  resulting in additional pension liability and expense and increasing required contributions to the pension plans 
concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular segment of the economy may have adverse effects the concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular industry  group of related industries or geographic sector could have an adverse effect on our investment portfolios and consequently on our results of operations and financial position 
events or developments that have a negative impact on any particular industry  group of related industries or geographic sector may have a greater adverse effect on the investment portfolios to the extent that the portfolios are concentrated rather than diversified 
we may suffer losses from litigation as is typical for a large company  we are involved in a substantial amount of litigation  including class action litigation challenging a range of company practices 
our litigation exposure could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition in a future period in the event of an unexpected adverse outcome or if additional reserves are required to be established for such litigation 
for a description of our current legal proceedings  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
we are subject to extensive regulation and potential further restrictive regulation may increase our operating costs and limit our growth as insurance companies  broker dealers  investment advisers and or investment companies  many of our subsidiaries are subject to extensive laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations are complex and subject to change 
moreover  they are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities  including state insurance regulators  state securities administrators  the sec  the national association of securities dealers  the us department of justice  and state attorneys general  each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude 
consequently  we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator s or enforcement authority s interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another regulator s or enforcement authority s interpretation of the same issue  particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight 
in addition  there is risk that any particular regulator s or enforcement authority s interpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment  or that changes in the overall legal environment may  even absent any particular regulator s or enforcement authority s interpretation of a legal issue changing  cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective  thus necessitating changes to our practices that may  in some cases  limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business 
furthermore  in some cases  these laws and regulations are designed to protect the interests of a specific constituency rather than a range of constituencies 
for example  state insurance laws and regulations are generally intended to protect purchasers or users of insurance products  not holders of securities issued by the allstate corporation 
in many respects  these laws and regulations limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business 
in recent years  the state insurance regulatory framework has come under public scrutiny and members of congress have discussed proposals to provide for optional federal chartering of insurance companies 
we can make no assurances regarding the potential impact of state or federal measures that may change the nature or scope of insurance regulation 
reinsurance may be unavailable at historical levels and prices which may limit our ability to write new business market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase 
no assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as are currently available 
if we were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable  we would have to either accept an increase in our net liability exposure  reduce our insurance writings  or develop or seek other alternatives 
reinsurance subjects us to the credit risk of our reinsurers and may not be adequate to protect us against losses arising from ceded insurance the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors  including whether insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract and whether reinsurers  or their affiliates  have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty or contract 
our inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
the continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may adversely affect the level of claim losses we incur and the value of our investment portfolio the continued threat of terrorism  both within the united states and abroad  and ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats  may cause significant volatility and declines in the equity markets and with interest rates in the united states  europe and elsewhere  and result in loss of life  property damage  additional disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity 
some of the assets in our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the equity markets and reduced economic activity caused by the continued threat of terrorism 
we seek to mitigate the potential impact of terrorism on our commercial mortgage portfolio by limiting geographical concentrations in key metropolitan areas and by requiring terrorism insurance to the extent that it is commercially available 
additionally  in the event that a terrorist act occurs  both allstate protection and allstate financial may be adversely affected  depending on the nature of the event 
any decrease in our financial strength ratings may have an adverse effect on our competitive position financial strength ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and generally have an effect on an insurance company s business 
on an ongoing basis  rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers and could downgrade or change the outlook on an insurer s ratings due to  for example  a change in an insurer s statutory capital  a change in a rating agency s determination of the amount of risk adjusted capital required to maintain a particular rating  an increase in the perceived risk of an insurer s investment portfolio  a reduced confidence in management or a host of other considerations that may or may not be under the insurer s control 
the insurance financial strength ratings of both aic and alic are a  aa and aa from am best  standard poor s and moody s  respectively 
several other affiliates have been assigned their own financial strength ratings by one or more rating agencies 
because all of these ratings are subject to continuous review  the retention of these ratings cannot be assured 
a multiple level downgrade in any of these ratings could have a material adverse effect on our sales  our competitiveness  and the marketability of our product offerings impacting our liquidity  operating results and financial condition 
changes in accounting standards issued by the fasb or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements our financial statements are subject to the application of gaap  which is periodically revised and or expanded 
accordingly  we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards from time to time issued by recognized authoritative bodies  including the fasb 
it is possible that future changes we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our results and financial condition 
for a description of potential changes in accounting standards that could affect us currently  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends may affect our liquidity and ability to meet our debt service obligations the allstate corporation is a holding company with no significant operations 
the principal asset is the stock of its subsidiaries 
state insurance regulatory authorities limit the payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries  as described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  competitive pressures generally require the subsidiaries to maintain insurance financial strength ratings 
these restrictions and other regulatory requirements affect the ability of the subsidiaries to make dividend payments 
limits on the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends could adversely affect our liquidity  including our ability to pay dividends to shareholders and service our debt 
the occurrence of events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems and management continuity planning could impair our ability to conduct business effectively in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe  an industrial accident  a terrorist attack or war  events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial condition  particularly if those events affect our computer based data processing  transmission  storage and retrieval systems 
in the event that a significant number of our managers could be unavailable in the event of a disaster  our ability to effectively conduct our business could be severely compromised
