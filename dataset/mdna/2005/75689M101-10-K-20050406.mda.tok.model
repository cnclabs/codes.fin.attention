item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations organization of information management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides a narrative on our financial performance and condition that should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
future results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain risk factors including  but not limited to  those discussed in risk factors under item and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this section includes the following discussions overview restatement unit data and comparable restaurant sales results of operations liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations inflation critical accounting policies and estimates recent accounting pronouncements forward looking statements overview red robin  which was founded in  is a casual dining restaurant chain focused on serving an imaginative selection of high quality gourmet burgers in a family friendly atmosphere 
as of april   we operate company owned restaurants in states 
we began franchising the red robin brand in and as of april   we have franchisees that operate restaurants in states and two canadian provinces 
our objective is to be the leading gourmet burger and casual dining restaurant destination 
in managing our operations  we focus on four cornerstones that we believe are essential to the success of our business values  people  burgers and time 
our restaurants are designed to create a fun and memorable dining experience in a family friendly atmosphere and provide our guests with an exceptional dining value 
our concept attracts a broad guest base by appealing to the entire family  particularly women  teens  kids ages to whom we refer to as tweens  and younger children 
all of our menu items are prepared to order in our restaurants 
the food items currently on our menu range in price from to  with a per person average check in of approximately  including beverages 
during  our company owned comparable restaurants had average unit volumes that exceeded million 
we are pursuing a disciplined growth strategy that includes the addition of company owned and franchised restaurants 
our restaurant expansion strategy focuses primarily on further penetrating existing markets with a cluster strategy and selectively entering into new markets 
we believe that our site selection strategy is critical to our success and we devote substantial time and effort to evaluating each site 
our site selection criteria focus on identifying markets  trade areas and other specific sites that are likely to yield the greatest density of desirable demographic characteristics  heavy retail traffic and a highly visible site 
our prototype restaurant is a free standing building with approximately  square feet  approximately seats and a patio 
based on this prototype  we expect that our average cash investment cost for our free standing restaurants in will be million  excluding land and pre opening costs 
our fiscal years ended december   december  and december  are referred to as  and  respectively 
each year presented included weeks

table of contents restatement on february   the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission sec issued a letter to the american institute of certified public accountants expressing its views regarding certain operating lease related accounting issues and their application under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
in light of this letter  management initiated a review of our lease accounting and determined that our previous methods of accounting for rent holidays and for leasehold improvements funded by landlord incentives or allowances under operating leases tenant improvement allowances were not in accordance with gaap 
as a result  we have restated our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended december  and december  our restated financial statements also reflect certain immaterial adjustments as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere herein 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k for a summary of the effects of the restatement of the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december   as well as on the company s consolidated statements of income and cash flows for and the accompanying management s discussion and analysis gives effect to these corrections 
in  we will amend our quarterly filings to reflect this restatement 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the cumulative effect of this restatement resulted in an increase in the accumulated deficit of  as of december   and decreases in net income of  and  for the fiscal years ended december  and december   respectively

these openings bring our total restaurant count as of april   to company owned restaurants  franchised restaurants and total restaurants 
we expect to open an additional to company owned restaurants and anticipate that our franchisees will open to additional restaurants during the remainder of we reflect restaurants as comparable in the first period following five full quarters of operations 
our company owned comparable restaurant sales increased in  in and in

total revenues increased by million  or  to million  from million  due primarily to a million increase in restaurant revenues 
the increase in restaurant revenues was due to million of revenues from new restaurants opened during  million in additional revenues from the non comparable restaurants we opened in and  and million from a comparable restaurant sales increase of 
the increase in comparable restaurant sales was driven by an increase in guest counts of and an increase in the average guest check of 
franchise royalties and fees increased million  or  to million from million 
franchise royalties increased million  or  to million  from million  due primarily to royalties generated from the franchise restaurants opened in and our franchisees reported that annual comparable sales for us and canadian franchise restaurants increased and  respectively 
franchise 
table of contents fees increased  or  to  from  due to the fact that there were seven additional franchise restaurants opened in compared to cost of sales 
cost of sales increased by million  or  to million  from million  due primarily to more restaurants being operated during cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant revenues remained constant at  primarily due to the menu price increases we implemented during january and mid june of  offset by higher commodity costs

labor expenses increased by million  or  to million  from million  due primarily to more restaurants being operated in labor expense as a percentage of restaurant revenues improved  to compared to in overall  labor as a percentage of restaurant revenues averaged at our comparable restaurants and at our non comparable restaurants 
total wages as a percentage of restaurant revenues improved during due to a improvement in controllable labor and a improvement in workers compensation costs offset by a increase in bonus expenses 
the improvement in workers compensation expense as a percentage of restaurant revenues was attributable to recent lower claims experience and per claim costs 
we cannot predict with certainty whether or not our workers compensation expense and controllable labor costs will increase or decrease during the increase in bonus expenses as a percentage of restaurant revenues was due primarily to improved comparable restaurant sales 
operating 
operating expenses increased by million  or  to million  from million  due primarily to more restaurants being operated in operating expenses as a percentage of restaurant revenues improved  to compared to in the improvement as a percentage of restaurant revenues was due primarily to leverage from our comparable restaurant sales increase offset by cost pressures in certain supplies and energy related items  such as plastic wrap  fuels and utilities  particularly during the fourth quarter of occupancy 
occupancy expenses increased by million  or  to million  from million  due primarily to more restaurants being operated in occupancy expense as a percentage of restaurant revenues improved  to compared to in our occupancy expense as a percentage of restaurant revenues improved as a result of our comparable restaurant sales increase 
in addition  the percentage of free standing restaurants that we own or have ground leases on has increased in compared to  and free standing units generally have lower occupancy costs than in line units 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million  from million 
the increase was primarily due to the addition of new restaurants in and a full year of depreciation related to the restaurants opened in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of total revenues increased  to compared to in the increase as a percentage of total revenues is primarily a result of newer restaurants having a higher depreciable costs basis than older restaurants 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million  from million  generally due to additional headcount  higher salaries and related costs attributable to operating more company owned restaurants and to costs associated with our public company reporting requirements 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased  to compared to in during we incurred  of costs to comply with the section internal control requirements of the sarbanes oxley act 
there were no comparable section costs incurred during these costs were primarily related to professional services and additional independent auditor fees 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur additional costs related to ongoing compliance with section in the future 
in addition  we incurred approximately  of additional audit and legal expenses related to the restatement of our financial statements as previously discussed 
franchise development 
franchise development expenses increased million  or  to million  from million 
approximately one quarter of this increase was attributable to our annual leadership 
table of contents conference which takes place in january each year 
costs for the leadership conference were higher than in due in part to the increased number of attendees 
franchise development expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased  to compared to in we substantially increased the size of our franchise development and support teams during the second half of in order to support franchisee restaurant openings and the growing franchisee restaurant base 
our franchisees opened restaurants during compared to ten in pre opening costs 
pre opening costs increased million  or  to million  from million  due primarily to the fact that there were company owned restaurants opened during  compared to during pre opening costs as a percentage of total revenues were and for and  respectively 
overall  pre opening costs for the restaurants we opened in averaged  per restaurant compared to an average of  per restaurant in on a per unit basis  pre opening expenses for restaurants that we opened in were higher as a result of increased costs related to opening restaurants in newer markets 
labor  training  travel and marketing costs are typically higher for newer markets compared to opening restaurants in more mature markets 
interest expense 
interest expense declined by  or  to million  from million 
our interest expense was lower in due to the early payoff of various real estate and equipment loans during that bore significantly higher interest rates than borrowings under our revolving credit agreement 
these reductions were partially offset by increased loan amortization and unused loan fees related to our revolving credit agreement as well as increased interest expense on borrowings from our revolving credit agreement 
interest income 
interest income was  in compared to  in interest income in and included  and  respectively  from related party notes receivable 
during december and february  certain officers repaid their notes in full  and as a result  we expect interest income to decrease by at least  during loss on extinguishment of debt 
during  we incurred  of charges related to debt extinguishment  which included a  non cash write off of capitalized debt issuance costs 
there were no similar charges in gain on sale of property 
during  we sold a parcel of land for million  resulting in a pre tax gain of  there were no similar gains in other 
other expense was  in  compared to other income of  in income before income taxes 
as a result of the above  income before income taxes increased million  or  to million  from million 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased million  or  to million  from million 
the increase was due primarily to increased pre tax earnings 
our effective income tax rate for was compared to for net income 
as a result of the above  net income increased by million  or  to million  from million 
compared to total revenues 
total revenues increased by million  or  to million  from million  due primarily to a million increase in restaurant revenues 
the increase in restaurant revenues was due to million of revenues from new restaurants opened and the one franchise restaurant we assumed operation of during  million in additional revenues from the non comparable restaurants that we 
table of contents opened in  million related to a full year of revenues for the ten restaurants we acquired from two franchisees during first quarter and million from comparable restaurant sales increases of 
the increase in comparable restaurant sales was driven by an increase in guest counts of and an increase in the average guest check of 
franchise royalties and fees increased  or  to million from million 
franchise royalties increased  or  to million  from million  due to an increase in royalties attributable to new franchise restaurants  comparable us franchise restaurant revenues increases of  and an increase in royalties from our canadian franchisee primarily due to more favorable currency exchange rates 
royalties from the ten new franchise restaurants opened during were partially offset because four franchise restaurants closed and we assumed the operations of one additional franchise restaurant in april franchise fees increased  or  to  from  because ten franchise restaurants were opened in compared to five in cost of sales 
cost of sales increased by million  or  to million  from million  due primarily to more restaurants being operated during cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant revenues increased  to  from 
overall  the increase as a percentage of restaurant revenues was attributable to increases in certain food costs during  including gourmet breads  hamburger  produce and pork 
labor 
labor expenses increased by million  or  to million  from million  due primarily to more restaurants being operated in overall  labor expense as a percentage of restaurant revenues was in and labor as a percentage of restaurant revenues was at our comparable restaurants and at our non comparable restaurants 
total wages as a percentage of restaurant revenues decreased during  due to improvements in controllable labor and floor supervisory wages at our non comparable restaurants and the ten restaurants we acquired in however  these improvements were entirely offset by an increase of for self insured workers compensation expenses  for bonus expenses and for payroll tax expenses 
the increase in bonus expenses was primarily due to higher bonuses earned as a result of improved comparable restaurant sales 
our workers compensation expense increased during due to a combination of higher claims experienced and higher per claim costs 
operating 
operating expenses increased by million  or  to million  from million  due primarily to more restaurants being operated in operating expenses as a percentage of restaurant revenues decreased  to  from 
we believe the improvement as a percentage of restaurant revenues was due in part to our increase in comparable restaurant sales and the discontinuance of one of our marketing funds midway through first quarter  for which we had previously contributed of restaurant revenues 
these improvements were partially offset by higher utilities  paper packaging costs  telecommunications charges and credit card processing fees 
occupancy 
occupancy expenses increased by million  or  to million  from million  due primarily to more restaurants being operated in occupancy expense as a percentage of restaurant revenues was for both and restaurant closures and impairment 
we recorded a million non cash impairment charge in to fully write down all of the long lived assets related to one restaurant  which we continue to operate 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million  from million 
the increase was primarily due to the addition of new restaurants opened in and a full year of depreciation related to the ten restaurants we opened during depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of total revenues increased  to  from 
the increase as a percentage of total revenues is primarily a result of newer restaurants having a higher depreciable costs basis than older restaurants 

table of contents general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million  from million  generally due to additional headcount  higher salaries and related costs attributable to operating more company owned restaurants and to costs associated with our public company reporting requirements 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues  however  improved  to  from 
the improvement in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues is due primarily to a decrease in marketing expenditures and to our increase in comparable restaurant sales 
in addition  we had unfilled positions in that we did not fill until fourth quarter that positively impacted our results in franchise development 
franchise development expenses decreased  or  to million  from million 
franchise development expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased  to  from  due primarily to several unfilled positions that we did not fill until fourth quarter and to a related reduction in other franchise development expenses  including travel and legal 
pre opening costs 
pre opening costs increased million  or  to million  from million  due primarily to the fact that there were company owned restaurants opened during  compared to ten during pre opening costs as a percentage of total revenues increased  to  from 
pre opening costs for the restaurants we opened in averaged  per restaurant compared to an average of  per restaurant for news restaurants we opened in gain on lease buy out 
during  we realized a non recurring gain of  due to a landlord lease buy out of one of our company owned restaurants and  as a result  we relocated the restaurant to a new location during impairment of property held for sale 
during  we recognized a  charge to reduce the carrying value of real estate held for sale to its estimated fair value less cost to sell 
this property was subsequently sold in for its approximate carrying value 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million  or  to million  from million 
the decrease was due primarily to lower average borrowings outstanding and a reduction in the overall interest rate of our debt in  compared to our average borrowings outstanding decreased because net proceeds from our july initial public offering and our november secondary offering were used to repay significant portions of our then outstanding borrowings 
interest income 
interest income decreased  or  to  from  the results include interest income of  from related party notes receivable  compared to  in the remaining change was attributable to decreases in interest income from franchisees and interest earned on our overnight sweep accounts

income before income taxes 
as a result of the above  income before income taxes increased million  or  to million  from million 

table of contents provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased million  or  to million  from million 
the increase was due primarily to increased pre tax earnings and an increase in our estimated effective income tax rate 
our effective income tax rate for was  compared to for net income 
as a result of the above  net income increased by million  or  to million  from million 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased by  in we attempt to keep only enough cash on hand to satisfy our working capital requirements  which can vary substantially as a result of seasonality  construction and other corporate needs 
all available cash in excess of our estimated working capital needs is generally used to repay short term borrowings under our revolving credit agreement 
the change in cash and cash equivalents for the periods presented are as follows in thousands cash provided by operating activities cash used by investing activities cash provided by financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities cash provided by operating activities during increased million  or  to million  compared to million in  reflecting increased cash flows from restaurant and franchise operations  lower cash payments for interest  increased cash from the gain on the sale of a property and increased cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities 
these increases were offset by higher income tax payments 
investing activities cash used in investing activities during increased million  or  to million  compared to million in our investing activities consist primarily of purchases of property and equipment related to the construction of restaurants as well as remodels and capital improvements of our existing restaurants 
we may also have activity related to the acquisition of franchise restaurants 
cash provided by investing activities generally relates to proceeds generated from the sale of real estate  property and equipment 
capital expenditures 
in  we invested million for construction of restaurants and million on remodels and capital improvements of our existing restaurants 
in addition  we spent million for corporate initiatives primarily related to information systems and computer equipment and our corporate relocation that occurred in march during  we invested million for construction of restaurants and million on remodels and capital improvements of our existing restaurants including assets related to the exercise of three capital lease purchase options 
in addition  we spent million for corporate initiatives primarily related to information systems and computer equipment 
during  we expect to open to new company owned restaurants for a total cost of million to million  and we anticipate that we will spend million to million on restaurant remodels and capital improvements of our existing restaurants 
in addition  we expect to invest million to million for corporate initiatives  including information systems and computer equipment 
for  we expect that our net cash used in investing activities will exceed our net cash provided by operating activities 
as a result  we anticipate that we will continue to make additional borrowings under our revolving credit agreement 
table of contents proceeds from investing activities 
proceeds of million in were generated primarily from the sale of one property compared to proceeds of  in  which were generated primarily from the sale of one property 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities during increased  our financing activities consist primarily of borrowings used to fund restaurant construction and other corporate needs in excess of cash provided by operations and proceeds we receive from sales of common stock 
cash used in financing activities is primarily related to the repayment of borrowings 
during  we expect our primary source of cash provided by financing activities will be obtained from additional borrowings under our revolving credit agreement 
proceeds from the issuance of stock 
during  we received million from the exercise of stock options and purchases of stock under our employee stock purchase plan  compared to  in borrowings 
we maintain a revolving credit agreement with a maximum borrowing capacity to million  which expires on may  this agreement is in place to fund the construction and acquisition of new restaurants  to refinance existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
the amended revolving credit agreement is secured by a first priority pledge of all of the outstanding capital stock of our subsidiaries and a first priority lien on substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants related to the revolving credit agreement 
our borrowing activity in was as follows in thousands additions payments total revolving credit agreement new capital lease obligations non cash repayments of capital leases and collateralized notes payable debt outstanding during had stated interest rates ranging from to and maturities ranging from through as of december   borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit agreement bore interest at approximately 
borrowings under our revolving credit agreement  as well as certain other existing borrowings  are subject to variable rates of interest as discussed further in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
we expect that interest rates related to our variable rate borrowings will increase during rising interest rates  combined with our anticipated increase in borrowings during  will likely lead to higher financing costs 
on october   an irrevocable letter of credit issued under our revolving credit agreement was increased to approximately million 
this letter is being maintained to back our self insured workers compensation program and reduces the amount of borrowings available on our revolving credit agreement 
our total committed borrowing capacity  capacity used and unused borrowing capacity as of december  were as follows in thousands committed capacity capacity used unused capacity revolving credit agreement the revolving credit agreement requires that capital expenditures  as defined  will not exceed specified amounts for each fiscal year 
to the extent we do not exceed the annual limitations any unused amount up to million in any fiscal year will be carried forward to the following fiscal year and will increase the limit in 
table of contents the succeeding year by such carry forward amount 
we did not carry forward any amount from that would increase the limit for as set forth in the following table in thousands amount the revolving credit agreement prohibits us from entering into or assuming any obligations for the payment of rent under operating leases which  with respect to all new restaurants opened in each fiscal year in the aggregate  would exceed million in each of and in addition  the revolving credit agreement prohibits us from entering into obligations with respect to operating leases that would allow for an annual increase  on a year to year basis  of more than 
at the end of  we had million outstanding under various real estate and equipment loans with ge capital 
these loans bear interest at the day commercial paper rate plus to  mature from to  and are secured by buildings  equipment and improvements on certain properties 
in addition  we had million outstanding under various real estate and equipment loans with other lenders 
these loans bear interest at rates ranging from to and mature from to the ge capital loans  together with certain of our other loans  require that we maintain a maximum debt to net worth ratio  a minimum debt coverage ratio  a minimum ebitda ratio and a maximum funded indebtedness ratio 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of these financial ratios 
capital resources 
we believe that anticipated cash flows from operations and funds available from our existing revolving credit agreement  together with cash on hand  will provide sufficient funds to finance our expansion plans and corporate initiatives through the remaining term of our revolving credit agreement  which expires on may  based on current market conditions and the company s financial condition and expected cash flows  we believe we will be able to raise additional equity and or restructure our debt financing prior to may  there can be no guarantee that financing will be available on acceptable terms  or at all  and our failure to raise capital when needed could negatively impact our growth plans and our financial condition and results of operations 
additional equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of our common stock and debt financing  if available  may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants and or financial ratios that restrict our ability to operate our business 
contractual obligations we have contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
however  other items  including various purchase commitments and other executory contracts  are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
for example  we are contractually committed to fulfill various operating lease obligations related to our company owned restaurants and other properties 

table of contents the following table summarizes the amounts of payments due under specified contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other non current liabilities long term debt obligations represent borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and other collateralized notes payable  excluding interest 
capital lease obligations include interest of million 
operating lease obligations represent future minimum lease commitments payable for land  buildings and equipment used in our operations 
this table excludes contingent rents  including amounts which are determined as a percentage of adjusted sales in excess of specified levels 
purchase obligations include commitments for the construction of new restaurants and other capital improvement projects  lease commitments for company owned restaurants where leases have been executed but construction has not begun  information technology contracts  including software licenses  maintenance and service agreements  commitments to purchase land related to new restaurants  employment agreements for two officers and other contractual obligations 
purchase obligations exclude food and beverage contracts for which no firm commitment exists 
other non current liabilities include deferred revenue and deferred compensation 
inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food and labor costs 
a large number of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage directly affect our labor costs 
many of our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and utilities  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 
we believe inflation had a modest impact on our results of operations during  and due primarily to rising commodity prices for certain foods we purchase at market rates 
we also experienced higher costs for materials and labor related to construction of our new restaurants  which became somewhat more evident during uncertainties related to future commodity prices  the supply of labor and construction materials make it difficult to predict what impact  if any  inflation may have during and beyond 
critical accounting policies and estimates in the ordinary course of business  management has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
property and equipment 
property and equipment is recorded at cost 
expenditures for major additions and improvements are capitalized and minor replacements  maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life for owned assets and the shorter of the estimated useful life or the term of the underlying lease for leased assets 
changes in circumstances such as changes to our business model or changes in our capital strategy can result in the actual 
table of contents useful lives differing from our estimates 
in those cases where management determines that the useful life of property and equipment should be shortened  we would depreciate the net book value over its revised remaining useful life thereby increasing depreciation and amortization expense 
factors such as changes in the planned use of fixtures or closing of facilities could also result in shortened useful lives 
our accounting policies regarding property and equipment include judgments by management regarding the estimated useful lives of these assets  the expected lease term for assets related to properties under lease and the determination as to what constitutes enhancing the value of or increasing the life of existing assets 
these judgments and estimates may produce materially different amounts of depreciation and amortization expense than would be reported if different assumptions were used 
as discussed further below  these judgments may also impact management s need to recognize an impairment charge on the carrying amount of these assets as the cash flows associated with the assets are realized 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets  including restaurant sites  leasehold improvements  other fixed assets  intangibles and goodwill are reviewed at least annually for impairment or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
expected cash flows associated with an asset is the key factor in determining the recoverability of the asset 
identifiable cash flows are generally measured at the restaurant level 
the estimate of cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance 
management s estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in operating performance 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
judgments made by management related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets  changes in economic conditions  and changes in operating performance 
as the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of long lived assets are assessed  these factors could cause us to realize a material impairment charge 
in  we recognized a million charge for the writedown of asset values related to one restaurant which we continue to operate 
there were no asset impairment charges in and we completed our most recent impairment test in december  and determined that there were no impairment losses related to goodwill  other intangible assets or property and equipment 
lease accounting 
we are obligated under various lease agreements for certain land  restaurant facilities and office space 
for operating leases  we recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term 
capital leases are recorded as an asset and a liability at an amount equal to the present value of the future minimum lease payments during the lease term 
under the provisions of certain of our leases  there are rent holidays and or escalations in payments over the base lease term  as well as renewal periods 
the effects of rent holidays and escalations have been reflected in rent costs on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  which includes cancelable option periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured that we will exercise such option periods due to the fact that we would incur an economic penalty for not doing so 
the lease term commences on the date when we become legally obligated for the rent payments which generally coincides with the time when the landlord delivers the property for us to develop and we waive contract contingencies 
under generally accepted accounting principles  there are two acceptable methods for recognizing rent costs during a period of construction  the capitalization method and the expense method 
historically  we have used the expense method 
under the expense method  all rent costs recognized during construction periods are expensed immediately as pre opening expenses 
using the expense method results in substantially higher current period costs compared to using the capitalization method because the construction period for our free standing restaurants is typically days  and as a result  the amount of rent costs that we recognize during construction periods is significant 
other companies in our industry may 
table of contents present their financial statements using the capitalization method and  as a result  our financial statements may not necessarily be comparable to other companies in our industry 
leasehold improvements and property held under capital leases for each restaurant facility are amortized on the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the same expected lease term used for lease accounting purposes commencing when the restaurant opens 
for each restaurant facility  the consolidated financial statements generally reflect the same lease term for amortizing leasehold improvements as management uses to determine capital versus operating lease classifications and in calculating straight line rent expense 
percentage rent expense is generally based upon adjusted restaurant sales levels and is accrued at the point in time when we determine that it is probable that such adjusted restaurant sales levels will be achieved 
leasehold improvements paid for by the landlord are recorded as leasehold improvements and deferred rent 
judgments made by management related to the probable term for each lease affect the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating  the rent holidays and or escalations in payments that are taken into consideration when calculating straight line rent  and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant facility are amortized 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used 
insurance self insurance liabilities 
we are self insured for certain losses related to health  general liability and workers compensation and we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total exposure 
the self insurance liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates  and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected  reserves might not be sufficient and additional expense may be recorded 
actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated  resulting in expense reductions 
unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas r  share based payment  a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r will require us to  among other things  measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in our consolidated financial statements 
the provisions of sfas r are effective for the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june   therefore  we will adopt the new requirements no later than the beginning of our third quarter of adoption of the expensing requirements will reduce our future reported earnings in a manner similar to that described in note to the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements under employee stock compensation plans 
management is currently evaluating the specific impacts of adoption  which include whether we should adopt the requirements on a retrospective basis and which valuation model is most appropriate 
in november  the fasb issued sfas  inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas clarifies that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities  excess freight and handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage are required to be recognized as current period charges 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have any impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk exposures for our assets are related to cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments with maturities of less than one year 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
under our amended revolving credit agreement  we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on borrowings  which bear interest at one of the following rates we select an abr  based on the prime rate plus to  or a libor  based on the relevant one  two  three or six month libor  at our discretion  plus to 
the spread  or margin  for abr and libor loans under the revolving credit agreement are subject to quarterly adjustment based on our then current leverage ratio  as defined by the agreement 
our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  we may use interest rate swaps and caps to manage our net exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowings 
as appropriate  on the date derivative contracts are entered into  we designate derivatives as either a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment fair value hedge  or a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability cash flow hedge 
we are party to a variable to fixed interest rate swap agreement which expires on january  the agreement has been designated as a cash flow hedge under which we will pay interest on million of notional amount at a fixed rate and receive interest on million of notional amount at a variable rate 
the variable rate interest received by us was initially based on the month libor rate determined two banking days prior to the effective date 
thereafter  the interest rate resets according to the then current month libor rate determined two banking days prior to the first day of each monthly calculation period 
this hedge is highly effective as defined by sfas  and there were no gains or losses recognized in earnings during or at the end of  the unrealized gain on derivative instruments designated and qualifying as cash flow hedging instruments that are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income was not material 
our variable rate based loans with ge capital bear interest at the day commercial paper rate plus a fixed percentage of to 
as of december   we had million of borrowings subject to variable interest rates  and a change in the effective interest rate applied to these loans would have resulted in pre tax interest expense fluctuating  on an annualized basis 
primarily all of our transactions are conducted  and our accounts are denominated  in united states dollars 
accordingly  we are not exposed to foreign currency risk 
many of the food products purchased by us are affected by changes in weather  production  availability  seasonality and other factors outside our control 
in an effort to control some of this risk  we have entered into some fixed price purchase commitments with terms of no more than a year 
in addition  we believe that almost all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to control food commodity risks
