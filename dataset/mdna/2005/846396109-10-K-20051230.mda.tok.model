item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview span america manufactures and markets a comprehensive selection of pressure management products for the medical market  including geo matt  pressureguard  geo mattress  span aids  isch dish  and selan products 
we also manufacture consumer mattress pads and pillows for the retail bedding market and custom foam and packaging products for the industrial market 
in addition  we have recently begun manufacturing and marketing the secure iv line of safety catheters for the short peripheral intravenous catheter market 
we group these products into three business segments medical  custom products and safety catheters 
our revenues  profits and cash flows are derived from the development  manufacture and sale of these products 
results of operations fiscal vs 
summary net sales in fiscal decreased to million compared with million in fiscal the decrease was the result of sales declines in the custom products segment that were not fully offset by strong sales growth in the medical segment 
sales in the custom products segment declined to million while sales in the medical segment rose by to million 
net income rose in fiscal to a record million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  in fiscal the increase in earnings resulted primarily from higher unit sales of pressureguard and geo mattress therapeutic surfaces for the medical market and a more profitable product mix  as sales rose in the higher margin medical segment and fell in the lower margin custom products segment 
sales sales in our medical segment rose to million in fiscal compared with million the previous year 
the medical sales growth was led by our therapeutic support surfaces or mattresses which increased by over levels 
we sell these specialty mattresses to hospitals  long term care facilities and home care dealers throughout the united states and canada 
increased sales of the pressureguard cft mattresses  sold mostly in the acute care market  made up about half of the total growth in the medical segment 
the pressureguard apm and easy air powered therapeutic surfaces and the geo mattress foam mattresses also made up a significant portion of our medical sales growth during the year 
the apm  easy air and geo mattress products are sold primarily in the long term care and home care sections of the medical market 
in other medical product lines  sales of seating products increased  selan skin care products rose by  and patient positioners decreased by due to lower export sales 
sales of overlays were down by  continuing a long term trend of customers switching to replacement mattresses from mattress overlays 
our medical business achieved solid growth in fiscal primarily because of increased customer acceptance of our therapeutic mattresses  particularly in the long term care market  and the initial success of our private label mattresses in the acute care market 
the combination of increasing medical mattress sales and declining overlay sales makes our total medical sales more volatile from quarter to quarter because mattresses are capital purchase items with longer selling cycles  whereas overlays are generally consumable items where repeat orders are common 
we expect total medical sales to increase during fiscal  but the rate of growth will likely be lower than that achieved in fiscal our custom products segment consists of consumer bedding products and specialty foam products for the industrial market 
sales in the custom products segment declined during fiscal to million from million in fiscal most of the custom products sales decrease was due to lower unit volumes of pillows and geo systems mattress pads sold to major retailers through louisville bedding company  our exclusive distributor for consumer foam products 
louisville bedding is a leading manufacturer and distributor of bedding products in north america 
sales of consumer bedding products decreased in to million 
the decline in consumer bedding sales resulted from increased competition in the mattress pad business  particularly from visco foam products  and in pillow products where a portion of our business was lost to a competing visco foam pillow manufactured in china 
in addition  we lost a smaller part of our mattress pad business due to a customer switching from our branded products to a lower cost private label version 
we are working closely with louisville bedding to develop new sales programs and products that could stabilize or reverse the recent trend of declining consumer sales 
however  we can give no assurance that these efforts will be successful 
we expect consumer sales in fiscal to be similar to fiscal levels 
in the other part of the custom products segment  industrial sales declined by to million 
the industrial sales decline was caused by the loss of business with several existing customers due to a temporary acquisition related purchase slowdown by a large customer  a customer s manufacturing operation being moved outside the united states  and pricing competition 
we believe industrial sales in fiscal will be slightly higher than those of fiscal in the safety catheter segment  sales were  as we recorded the first shipments of the redesigned secure iv product line in the fourth quarter of fiscal the secure iv safety catheter was not offered for sale in the first three quarters of fiscal pending the completion of design enhancements 
we began shipping market test samples of the product in the latter part of fiscal however  in december we decided to delay the full release of the secure iv as a result of initial customer feedback that revealed the potential benefits of making three design improvements to the product 
the design improvements were completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and we began limited shipments of the new products 
we expect sales of secure iv to increase in fiscal  but the rate of increase is difficult to predict because it will depend on manufacturing speed and reliability  selling price  and the market s acceptance of this new product 
we continue to be optimistic about the future prospects for the safety catheter segment  but we do not expect the segment to be profitable in fiscal we believe the operating loss for the segment in fiscal will be less than that of fiscal gross profit our gross profit level increased by to million during fiscal from million in fiscal the gross profit margin percentage rose to for fiscal compared with for fiscal the increases in gross profit level and margin were due to higher sales volumes in the medical segment 
the medical segment typically has a higher gross margin than the custom products segment because many of our medical products are patented and proprietary 
we expect the gross margin percentage during fiscal to be slightly lower than that of fiscal selling  research development and administrative expenses selling and marketing expenses increased to million  or of sales  in fiscal compared with million  or of sales  in fiscal most of the increase occurred in the medical segment and was due to higher expenses for commissions  sales salaries and shipping costs 
selling and marketing expenses increased as a percent of sales primarily because of the decline in custom products sales during the year 
we believe that total selling and marketing expenses for fiscal will increase over levels due to planned programs in the medical and safety catheter segments and expected future growth in the medical segment 
total r d expenses increased to million in fiscal compared with  in fiscal the majority of the increase occurred in the safety catheter segment and was related to new product development efforts for the secure iv product line 
r d expense for the safety catheter segment in fiscal increased to  compared with  in the prior year 
the increased costs were primarily due to higher expenses for labor  scrapped material  engineering and product development related to design changes and production test runs 
we expect r d expenses for the safety catheter segment to decline in fiscal as we shift away from product development efforts toward sales and marketing activities 
we consider safety catheters to be a separate reportable segment based on product type and distribution channels 
see note in the notes to financial statements for additional information on the safety catheter segment 
we expect that total r d expenses in fiscal will be less than those of because of the planned reduction in safety catheter development costs 
general and administrative expenses remained level at million in fiscal lower professional fees  incentive compensation and bad debt expenses were offset by higher costs for property and casualty insurance and administrative salaries 
we expect general and administrative expenses for to be slightly higher than levels 
operating profit increased to million compared to million in fiscal the increase was primarily caused by higher medical sales volume and a more profitable product mix 
non operating income investment income increased by to  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal the increase in investment income was the result of higher interest rates and slightly higher average balances of marketable securities in fiscal royalty income decreased to  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal as a result of lower sales volume of the safety lok shielded syringe product licensed to becton dickinson and company bd 
our license agreement with bd will expire in december due to the expiration of the related patents 
we expect to receive the final royalty payment from bd in february other non operating income for included a  gain on the sale of manufacturing equipment 
we expect total non operating income for fiscal to be significantly lower than levels because of lower royalty income as described above 
net income and dividends net income for fiscal increased to million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  in fiscal the increase was due primarily to higher sales volume in the medical segment and a more profitable sales mix 
during fiscal  we paid dividends of approximately million  or of net income  for the year 
this amount represented three quarterly dividends of per share  one quarterly dividend of and one special dividend of per share 
results of operations fiscal vs 
summary net sales in fiscal increased to million compared with million in fiscal the increase was the result of sales growth in our custom products and medical business segments 
custom products sales were up to million 
sales in the medical segment rose by to million 
net income increased in fiscal to million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  in fiscal our increase in earnings resulted from higher sales volume  lower labor costs from manufacturing process improvements  and slower growth in selling and administrative expenses 
sales sales in the custom products segment rose during fiscal to million from million in fiscal most of the sales increase in the custom products segment was due to higher unit volumes of pillows and geo systems mattress pads sold to wal mart and other major retailers through louisville bedding company  our exclusive distributor for consumer foam products 
sales of consumer bedding products increased in to million 
in the other part of the custom products segment  industrial sales declined by to million 
the industrial sales decline was caused by the loss of business as some customers moved their manufacturing operations outside the united states 
sales in our medical segment rose to million in fiscal compared with million the previous year 
the medical sales growth was led by our pressureguard and geo mattress therapeutic mattresses which increased by over levels 
most of the mattress growth came from our pressureguard apm  cft and geo mattress wings products 
in other medical product lines  sales of patient positioners increased by  seating products increased  and selan skin care products rose by 
sales of overlays were down by  continuing a long term trend of customers switching to replacement mattresses from mattress overlays 
in the safety catheter segment  sales were  as we recorded the first shipments of the new secure iv product line in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal gross profit our gross profit level increased by to million during fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in gross profit level was due to higher sales volume and improved labor efficiencies 
the gross profit margin percentage declined to for fiscal year compared with for fiscal the decline in gross margin percentage resulted from higher sales of consumer products in compared with as they carry lower margins than most of our medical products 
the gross margin percentage in was also lowered slightly by new depreciation expense for secure iv production equipment 
selling  research development and administrative expenses selling and marketing expenses increased to million  or of sales  in fiscal compared with million  or of sales  in fiscal most of the increase occurred in the medical segment and was due to higher expenditures for shipping  incentive compensation  advertising and trade shows 
in addition  marketing expense in the custom products segment increased in due to a special promotion program for consumer bedding products 
sales and marketing expenses declined as a percent of sales because most of our sales growth for fiscal came from the custom products segment  which has much lower selling and marketing expenses than the medical segment 
total research and development expenses increased to  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal the increase was nearly evenly divided between the medical and safety catheter segments and stemmed from new product development efforts in both segments 
r d expense for the safety catheter segment in fiscal increased to  compared with  in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in due to higher property and casualty insurance costs and incentive compensation expense which was partly offset by lower professional fees and bad debt expense 
non operating income investment income increased by to  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal the increase was the result of a  pre tax gain on the sale of prudential financial common stock received through prudential s demutualization process 
the gain was partially offset by a decline in investment income  which was the result of lower interest rates and a lower average balance of marketable securities in fiscal royalty income decreased to  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal as a result of lower sales volume of the safety lok shielded syringe product licensed to becton dickinson and company bd 
other non operating income for also included a  loss on the retirement of certain equipment 
net income and dividends net income increased in fiscal to million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  in fiscal the increase in earnings resulted from higher sales volume  lower labor costs from manufacturing process improvements  and slower growth in selling and administrative expenses 
during fiscal  we paid dividends of  or of net income  for the year 
this amount represented three quarterly dividends of per share and one of per share 
liquidity and capital resources we generated cash from operations of million during fiscal  which was an decline compared with million in fiscal the major factors contributing to the change in cash flow during the year were higher net income  increases in depreciation and amortization expense  and a decrease in prepaid expenses due mainly to a reduction in prepaid insurance caused by a change in the policy year 
those additions to cash flow were offset by a reduction in our net deferred tax liability  increases in accounts receivable and inventory due to higher sales levels  and the addition of inventory for the safety catheter segment 
working capital decreased by  or  to million during fiscal the decline was caused by lower year end balances of cash and marketable securities related to capital expenditures  a special dividend payment and the reduction in prepaid insurance expense as described above 
our working capital level was also affected by an increase in accounts payable associated with higher sales levels and an increase in income taxes payable due to increased earnings 
our current ratio decreased to at october  from at fiscal year end accounts receivable  net of allowances  increased to million at the end of fiscal compared with million at the end of fiscal the majority of the increase resulted from higher sales in the medical segment particularly in the last two months of fiscal compared with the same period in fiscal the days sales outstanding or average collection time  calculated using a month average for accounts receivable balances  increased to days in compared with days in all of our accounts receivable are unsecured 
inventory  net of reserves  increased by  to million at october  compared with million at october  approximately  of the increase occurred in the safety catheter segment because of a january change in our contract manufacturing agreement that required us to begin carrying secure iv inventory for the first time 
the remaining part of the increase was due to higher raw material levels in the custom products and medical segments 
inventory turns for fiscal decreased to times from times in fiscal primarily because of the increase in safety catheter inventory 
we expect inventory levels in fiscal to be slightly higher than those of fiscal net property and equipment increased by during fiscal the change resulted from the combination of building and equipment purchases of million partially offset by regular depreciation expense 
shortly after the close of fiscal  we completed the addition of  square feet of manufacturing and storage space to our plant in greenville  south carolina 
the total cost of the expansion was million  but as of october  we had incurred related project costs of approximately million because the building was approximately complete at fiscal year end 
we expect capital expenditures in fiscal to be significantly less than fiscal primarily because no building expansion is planned in and capital expenditures will be limited mainly to investments in new equipment 
from time to time  we purchase forward contracts for foreign currency to lock in exchange rates for future payments on manufacturing equipment that we order 
the foreign exchange contracts are used to eliminate foreign currency fluctuations during the six to nine month period between the date the order is placed and the date of final payment 
realized gains and losses  if any  are included in the cost of the related equipment 
unrealized gains and losses on open contracts are not material to our results of operations or financial condition 
we held no forward contracts as of october  we have not engaged in foreign currency transactions since fiscal year however  it is possible that we will do so again in fiscal due to anticipated purchases of equipment manufactured in germany 
our trade accounts payable increased in fiscal to million 
the increase in payables was primarily the result of higher sales levels and associated purchases during the last two months of the fiscal year 
accrued and sundry liabilities increased by during the year to million compared with million last year 
the increase was mostly due to higher accruals for income taxes 
in december  our board of directors declared a special cash dividend of per share  or million that was paid on january  to shareholders of record on december  we believe that funds on hand and funds generated from operations are adequate to finance our operations and expected capital requirements during fiscal during early fiscal  we renegotiated certain terms of the supply agreement with the contract manufacturer for our secure iv product line 
the new terms require us to pay approximately  per week in labor and overhead charges for production of the secure iv catheter in lieu of a per unit charge 
this weekly charge is expected to remain in effect for the next six to months  depending on actual production volume  and can be changed by the mutual agreement of both parties 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments at october  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
for additional information regarding these obligations  see the referenced footnotes to in the notes to financial statements under item below 
payments due by period contractual obligations less than more than dollars in thousands total year years years years operating leases note purchase obligations note deferred compensation note total contractual obligations impact of inflation and cost of raw materials inflation was a moderate factor for our operations in fiscal we received price increases on certain of our polyurethane foam raw materials on october   february   april  and may  we recovered the majority of the cost of these increases by raising sales prices  improving manufacturing efficiencies and other cost reduction efforts 
however  future increases in the cost of polyurethane foam will likely have a larger impact on the business in fiscal than we experienced in as we announced on october   our largest foam suppliers notified us of price increases of to  depending on the type of foam  effective november  we were later notified of an additional surcharge placed on most types of foam effective october  these increases have now occurred 
we expect the price increases to affect both the supply of competitive products and the demand for products that include foam as a major raw material component 
based on conversations with our suppliers  we do not expect span america to be on allocation for any key foam raw materials 
we believe that a portion of the higher foam costs will be a short term problem since they are being caused by gulf coast hurricane related disruptions in the supply of certain chemicals used in the foam manufacturing process 
a portion of the price increases may be longer term in nature since they are related to higher natural gas costs 
we plan to raise our sales prices in tandem with the increased costs of foam  but we do not expect to recoup all of our higher raw material costs due to competition in certain markets and pricing established in certain contracts 
at this point  we expect that the higher foam prices could reduce our earnings in fiscal  but we cannot quantify the effect until we have some operating history with the increased costs  potential shifts in demand and related competitive factors 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements which we prepare in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates and assumptions also require the application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
we periodically review our accounting policies and estimates and make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
any differences may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to the accounting policies which are more fully described in the notes to financial statements included in this report  we have identified the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts credit evaluations are undertaken to set credit limits for all customers 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate past due items in the accounts receivable listing and provide what we estimate to be adequate reserves for doubtful accounts 
customer economic conditions may change and increase the risk of collectibility and may require additional provisions which would negatively impact our operating results 
as of october   our provision for doubtful accounts represented approximately of total accounts receivable  or  inventories we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and adjust for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage rates and our estimated forecast of product demand and production 
actual demand may differ from our estimate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for obsolete and excess inventory  which would have an impact on our operating results 
as of october   our provision for excess and obsolete inventory represented approximately of total inventories  or  we began to carry secure iv inventory in fiscal since we have limited sales and production history for this new product line  our future estimates for secure iv inventory reserves could be more volatile than those in our medical and custom products segments 
warranty obligations we warrant certain of our products for a specific period of time against manufacturing or performance defects 
we provide for the estimated future cost of warranty obligations in cost of goods sold when the related revenue is recognized 
the accrued warranty cost represents our best estimate at the time of sale of the total cost that we will incur to repair or replace covered products or parts 
the amount of accrued estimated warranty cost is primarily based on historical experience as well as current information on repair costs 
actual warranty cost could differ from the estimated amounts 
on a quarterly basis  we review the accrued balances and update the historical warranty cost trends 
if we were required to accrue additional warranty cost in the future  it would negatively affect operating results 
our actual warranty expense was  in fiscal and  in fiscal see notes and in the notes to financial statements for more information on product warranties 
impairment of goodwill as required by sfas no 
 we evaluate goodwill in our medical business unit for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that could reduce the fair value of our medical business unit 
for fiscal year end  we determined that the fair value of the medical business unit exceeded its carrying value and thus no impairment charge was required 
in assessing the value of goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the medical business unit 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges which would negatively impact operating results 
as of october   the carrying value of goodwill was million 
impairment of long lived assets impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a long lived asset or asset group is greater than its fair value 
as required by sfas no 
 we evaluate long lived assets for potential impairment whenever events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable and is greater than its fair value  the asset is impaired and an impairment loss must be recognized 
to date  we have had no indicators of impairment for long lived assets 
however  our investment in the safety catheter business unit raises the possibility of a future impairment loss because the new business unit has little sales and production history and is just emerging from the development phase 
we do not currently expect this segment to suffer impairment in the foreseeable future  however  we can offer no assurance to this effect 
if the assets associated with the safety catheter segment became impaired  the impairment loss could be as much as the total assets of the safety catheter segment 
see note in the notes to financial statements 
if such an event had occurred as of october   our assets and operating income would have been reduced by up to million  and net income after taxes would have been reduced by up to million  or per diluted share  using the weighted average diluted shares outstanding at fiscal year end the actual amount of any future impairment loss could be more or less  depending on the level of assets and the degree of impairment at the time we determine an impairment charge is necessary 
present value of deferred compensation we are obligated to make fixed payments under a retirement agreement over the remaining life of span america s founder as discussed in note deferred compensation in the notes to financial statements 
we have fully accrued the present value of the expected payments due over the executive s estimated life expectancy 
in calculating this present value we estimated an effective long term interest rate of 
if actual long term interest rates declined significantly and we were required to accrue additional deferred compensation costs in the future  it would negatively affect operating results 
as of october   we had recorded a deferred compensation liability of  including current and deferred portions 
if we reduced the discount rate by  the deferred compensation liability would be increased by  and pre tax income would be reduced by the same amount 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risk in two areas short term investments and cash value of life insurance 
as of october   we had short term investments of million which were classified as available for sale 
included in these short term investments are approximately million of high quality and highly liquid corporate commercial paper and bonds known as variable rate demand notes or low floaters 
the bonds are issued by municipalities or companies and are backed by letters of credit from federally insured banks 
the bonds carry the credit rating of the underlying bank and are therefore highly rated 
the interest rate on the bonds is a floating rate which is reset weekly by the re marketing agent based on market rates for comparable securities 
we can liquidate the bonds at any time with a settlement date of five to seven days after the trade date 
using the level of securities available for sale at fiscal year end  a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates for one year would increase or decrease after tax earnings by approximately  our million in short term investments at fiscal year end also included approximately  in a portfolio of investment grade preferred stocks 
the preferred shares are generally callable within three to five years and have an after tax dividend yield currently higher than the variable rate demand notes described above 
dividends from the preferred stocks are generally paid quarterly and qualify for the dividends received deduction available to corporate holders of the preferred shares 
these shares are traded on the new york stock exchange and per share prices are subject to interest rate risks similar to intermediate term bonds as well as specific company risk factors 
we believe that substantial fluctuations in long term interest rates or prices of the preferred stocks would not have a material effect on our financial position 
in addition  our other assets at october  include million in cash value of life insurance  which is subject to market risk related to equity pricing and interest rate changes 
the cash value is generated from life insurance policies which are being used as the funding vehicle for a retirement program for span america s founder and former chairman 
the cash value is invested in a combination of fixed income life insurance contracts and a portfolio of mutual funds managed by an insurance company 
the fixed income contracts are similar to fixed income bond funds and are therefore subject to interest rate and company risk 
the mutual fund portfolios invest in common stocks and bonds in accordance with their individual investment objectives 
these portfolios are exposed to stock market and interest rate risk similar to comparable mutual funds 
we believe that substantial fluctuations in equity markets and interest rates and the resulting changes in cash value of life insurance would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
during the fiscal year ended october   cash value of life insurance increased by  creating after tax income of approximately
