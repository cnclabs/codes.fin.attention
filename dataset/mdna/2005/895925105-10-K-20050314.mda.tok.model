item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations analyzes the consolidated financial condition  changes in financial position  and results of operations for the three years ended december   of triad guaranty inc and its consolidated subsidiaries  collectively the company 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes 
certain of the statements contained herein  other than statements of historical fact  are forward looking statements 
these statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and include estimates and assumptions related to economic  competitive  and legislative developments 
these forward looking statements are subject to change and uncertainty  which are  in many instances  beyond our control and have been made based upon our expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effect on us 
actual developments and their results could differ materially from those expected by us  depending on the outcome of certain factors  including the possibility of general economic and business conditions that are different than anticipated  legislative developments  changes in interest rates or the stock markets  stronger than anticipated competitive activity  and the factors described in the forward looking statements 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the ultimate outcome could differ from those estimates and assumptions utilized in the preparation of the financial statements 
we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates in that they involve a higher degree of judgment and are subject to a significant degree of variability reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  the timely identification of potentially impaired securities and valuation of those securities  and deferred policy acquisition costs 
in developing these estimates  we make subjective and complex judgments that are inherently uncertain and subject to material change as facts and circumstances develop 
although variability is inherent in these estimates  we believe the amounts provided are appropriate based on the facts available upon compilation of the financial statements 
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses we calculate our best estimate of reserves to provide for the estimated costs of settling claims on loans reported in default and loans in default that are in the process of being reported to us 
our reserving process incorporates various components in a formula that gives effect to current economic conditions and profiles delinquencies by such factors as policy year  geography  chronic late payment characteristics  the number of months the policy has been in default  as well as whether the defaults were underwritten as flow business or as part of a structured bulk transaction 
the process is based upon the assumption that long term historical experience  taking into consideration the above factors and adjusted for current economic events that we believe will significantly impact the long term loss development  provides a reasonable basis for estimating projected claim rates frequency and claim amounts severity 
we consider severity and frequency to be the most significant assumptions in the establishment of our loss reserves 
estimation of loss reserves is a difficult and inexact process and there are inherent risks and uncertainties involved in making these assumptions 
economic conditions that have affected the development of loss reserves in the past may not necessarily affect development patterns in the future in either a similar manner or degree 
due to the inherent uncertainty in estimating reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  there can be no assurance that reserves will be adequate to cover ultimate loss developments on loans in default  currently or in the future 
the company s profitability and financial condition could be adversely affected to the extent that the company s estimated reserves are insufficient to cover losses on loans in default 
because the estimate for loss reserves is sensitive to the estimates of claims frequency and severity  we perform analyses to test the reasonableness of the best estimate generated by the loss reserve process 
the loss reserve estimation process and the analyses support the reasonableness of the best estimate of loss reserves recorded in our financial statements 
see the financial position section below for a more detailed discussion of the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
investments valuing our investment portfolio involves a variety of assumptions and estimates  particularly for investments that are not actively traded 
we rely on external pricing sources for highly liquid  publicly traded securities and use an internal pricing matrix for privately placed securities 
this matrix relies on our judgment concerning a the discount rate we use in calculating expected future cash flows  b credit quality and c expected maturity 
we regularly monitor our investment portfolio to ensure that investments that may be other than temporarily impaired are identified in a timely fashion  properly valued  and any other than temporary impairments are charged against earnings in the proper period 
our methodology to identify potential impairments is further described in the investments section below 
the timely identification and valuation of potentially impaired securities involves many judgments 
inherently  there are risks and uncertainties involved in making these judgments 
changes in circumstances and critical assumptions such as unforeseen events which affect our investments in one or more companies  political subdivisions  or industries could result in additional write downs in future periods for impairments that are deemed to be other than temporary 
see further discussion of the valuation of our investment portfolio under the investment section below 
deferred policy acquisition costs the costs of acquiring new business  principally commissions and certain policy underwriting and issue costs which vary with and are primarily related to the production of new business  are capitalized as deferred policy acquisition costs dac 
amortization of such policy acquisition costs is charged to expense in proportion to premium recognized over the estimated policy life 
we make judgments in the identification of deferrable acquisition costs and the determination of estimated policy life utilized in the amortization assumptions 
see further discussion of dac under the financial position section below 
overview through our subsidiaries  we provide mortgage guaranty insurance coverage to residential mortgage lenders and investors as a credit enhancement vehicle  typically when individual borrowers have less than equity in the property 
business originated by lenders and submitted to us on a loan by loan basis is referred to as flow business 
mortgage guaranty insurance facilitates the sale of individual low down payment loans in the secondary market and provides protection to lenders who choose to keep the loans in their own portfolios 
additionally  we provide mortgage insurance to lenders and investors who seek additional default protection  capital relief  and credit enhancement on groups of loans that are sold in the secondary market 
this business is referred to as structured bulk transactions 
our revenues principally consist of a initial and renewal earned premiums from flow business net of reinsurance premiums ceded as part of our risk management strategies  b initial and renewal earned premiums from structured bulk transactions  and c investment income on invested assets 
we also realize investment gains  net of investment losses  periodically as a source of revenue when the opportunity presents itself within the context of our overall investment strategy 
our expenses essentially consist of a amounts ultimately paid on claims submitted  b increases in reserves for estimated future claim payments  c general and administrative costs of acquiring new business and servicing existing policies  d other general business expenses  and e income taxes 
our profitability depends largely on a the adequacy of our product pricing and underwriting discipline relative to the risks insured  b persistency levels  c operating efficiencies  and d the level of investment yield  including realized gains and losses  on our investment portfolio 
we define persistency as the percentage of insurance in force remaining from twelve months prior 
cancellations of policies originated during the past twelve months are not considered in our calculation of persistency 
this method of calculating persistency may vary from that of other mortgage insurers 
we believe that our calculation presents an accurate measure of the percentage of insurance in force remaining from twelve months prior 
cancellations result primarily from the borrower refinancing or selling mortgaged residential properties and  to a lesser degree  from the borrower achieving prescribed equity levels at which the lender no longer requires mortgage guaranty insurance 
consolidated results of operations following is a summary of our results for the last three years in thousands except per share information favorable unfavorable change change vs vs earned premiums net investment income net realized investment gains losses other income total revenues net losses and loss adjustment expenses interest expense on debt amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs other operating expenses net of acquisition costs deferred income before income taxes income taxes net income diluted earnings per share a primary driver of our results is persistency  due to its impact on both renewal earned premiums and the amortization of dac 
increased persistency means that more of our business is being retained and renewal earned premiums increase as a result 
further  amortization of dac is based on assumed persistency levels 
when actual persistency levels are lower than that assumed in our dac models  we accelerate the amortization of dac expense 
annual persistency levels increased throughout as refinanced activity slowed from levels experienced in  which reduced dac amortization expense in the current year from that of two other important drivers of our results have been an increase in bulk production and the development of losses and loss adjustment expenses 
we describe our results in greater detail in the discussions that follow 
the information is presented in three categories in each of the year to year comparisons that follow production and in force  revenues  and losses and expenses 
compared to net income for increased over driven by a increase in earned premiums and a decline in dac amortization 
net loss and loss adjustment expense increased  partially offsetting these favorable impacts 
net income per share on a diluted basis increased over net realized investment gains  after taxes  contributed income of per share on a diluted basis in compared to per share for diluted realized gains and losses per share is a non gaap measure 
we believe this is relevant and useful information to investors because  except for write downs on other than temporarily impaired securities  it shows the effect that our discretionary sales of investments had on earnings 
production and in force total insurance written in was billion compared to billion in  a decrease of 
total insurance written includes insurance written from flow production and structured bulk transactions 
flow insurance written for decreased to billion from billion in we experienced record levels of production in due to the lower interest rate environment in that year that contributed to a very strong refinance market 
refinances comprised of our flow insurance written in compared to in loan originations for the entire industry declined approximately in  primarily due to this drop in refinancing activity 
the mortgage bankers association anticipates an even smaller loan origination market for compared to this is due in part to the continued decline in refinancing activity  as borrowers have previously locked in lower rates and terms than are expected to be available in further  the continued expansion of alternative credit enhancements such as structures a combination of an first mortgage loan  a second mortgage loan usually issued by the same lender  and a down payment continues to erode the mortgage insurance industry s overall penetration into the mortgage marketplace 
we believe that the increasing use of these alternative credit enhancements will moderate new flow business in however  should interest rates rise  these types of arrangements will become less attractive to borrowers 
insurance written in attributable to structured bulk transactions totaled billion compared to billion in as we continued our strategic commitment to that market 
insurance written attributed to structured bulk transactions is likely to vary significantly from period to period due to a the limited number of transactions but with larger size occurring in this market  b the level of competition from other mortgage insurers  c the relative attractiveness in the marketplace of mortgage insurance versus other forms of credit enhancement  and d the changing loan composition and underwriting criteria of the market 
although terms vary  the structured bulk market can be broadly categorized into three different segments  or tiers  depending on the risk characteristics of the loans comprising a transaction 
the loan characteristics of the three segments are a predominantly high credit quality  low loan to value ltv  fully underwritten loans that may have niche characteristics such as non conforming loan balances and risk concentrations related to geography  transaction purpose  or occupancy type  b loans that generally have high credit quality and low to moderate ltvs that have been underwritten with reduced  streamlined  or no documentation  and c generally fully underwritten loans with credit impaired borrowers fico credit score less than 
in general  we believe that structured bulk business originated in segments b and c will report a higher default rate than our flow business 
however  we also believe that the lower ltvs associated with the structured bulk business originated in segments a and b will ultimately generate lower claim rates as a proportion of the reported defaults and lower levels of severity than flow business 
we have entered into structured bulk transactions primarily in the first two segments mentioned above 
at december   only approximately of our insurance in force attributable to structured bulk transactions is categorized in segment c above 
the following table provides estimates of our national market share of net new primary insurance written based on information available from the industry association and other public sources year ended december flow business structured bulk transactions total our market share of flow business declined slightly in from due to the decline in production of a product driven primarily by the refinance segment 
the increase in our structured bulk transactions market share shown above was the result of the greater availability of transactions that met our credit quality and pricing benchmarks on which we were able to successfully bid 
periodically we enter into structured bulk transactions involving loans that have insurance effective dates within the current reporting period but for which detailed loan information regarding the insured loans is not provided by the issuer of the transaction until later 
when this situation occurs  we accrue premiums that are due but not yet paid based upon the estimated commitment amount of the transaction in the reporting period with respect to each loan s insurance effective date 
however  the policies are not reflected in our in force  insurance written  or related industry data totals until the loan level detail is reported to us 
at december   we had approximately billion of structured transactions with effective dates within the fourth quarter for which loan level detail had not been received and  therefore  are not included in our own data or industry totals 
these amounts will be reported as new production and insurance in force totals in when the issuer of the transactions provides loan level detail to us 
we have properly included in premium written and premium earned the respective estimated amounts due and earned during related to this insurance 
total direct insurance in force reached billion at december   compared to billion at december  as a result of continued production and an improvement in persistency 
the following table shows our persistency rates for our flow and structured bulk business at december  and flow structured bulk total the increase in persistency rates over the levels was primarily due to the decline in refinance activity described above 
if current interest rate levels persist or increase further  we anticipate continuing  although slowing  improvements in persistency in however  persistency will be adversely affected if rates decline significantly from current levels 
our direct insurance in force grew from december  to december   and the credit quality of our in force portfolio has remained relatively consistent 
as shown below  the credit quality of our structured bulk business at december  has improved over december  as we have focused our efforts on transactions consisting of higher quality loans 
fico credit scores are one of the major factors used in assessing credit risk 
the following table presents the fico credit score distribution of our risk in force for both flow and structured bulk business at december  and structured flow bulk credit score less than credit score between and credit score greater than as the table shows  we insure some loans that have fico credit scores below we believe that these loans have a higher probability of loss than a loan with a fico credit score of or greater 
we do not expect loans with fico scores less than to become a significant portion of our insurance in force 
revenues total direct premiums written were million for  an increase of compared to million for this increase was driven by a million increase in direct renewal premiums written  partially offset by a million decline in direct initial premiums 
as mentioned earlier  increased persistency was the primary factor that caused the increase in renewal premiums in lower mortgage originations for the industry caused by lower levels of refinancings and the increased popularity of the alternative credit enhancements described earlier caused the decline in direct initial premiums 
net premiums written increased to million in over million in the difference between direct premiums written and net premiums written is ceded premium 
ceded premium is comprised of premiums written under excess of loss reinsurance treaties with captive as well as non captive reinsurance companies 
driven by an increase in the amount of premium subject to captive reinsurance arrangements  ceded premiums written increased to million in from million in the following table provides further data on ceded premiums for the years ended december  and premium cede rate ceded premiums written as a percentage of direct premiums written captive reinsurance premium cede rate ceded premiums written under captive reinsurance arrangements as a percentage of direct premiums written average captive premium cede rate ceded premiums written under captive reinsurance arrangements as a percentage of direct premiums written under captive reinsurance arrangements during  of flow insurance written and of total insurance written was subject to captive reinsurance arrangements  compared to of flow insurance written and of total insurance written in the increase in the percentage of flow insurance written subject to captive reinsurance arrangements is primarily a result of decreased production in our lender paid mortgage insurance program that is generally not subject to captive reinsurance arrangements 
additionally  none of our insurance written in and attributable to structured bulk transactions was subject to captive reinsurance arrangements 
at december   of direct flow insurance in force and of total direct insurance in force was subject to captive reinsurance arrangements  compared to and of total insurance in force at december  none of our insurance in force under structured bulk transactions is subject to captive reinsurance arrangements 
we believe captive reinsurance arrangements are an effective risk management tool as selected lenders share in the risk under such arrangements 
additionally  captive reinsurance arrangements are structured so that triad receives capital relief in certain risk based capital models utilized by rating agencies 
we remain committed to the concept of captive reinsurance arrangements  including deep ceded arrangements where the net premium cede rate is greater than  on a lender by lender basis as we deem it to be prudent 
we will continue to be an active participant with our lender partners in structures utilizing alternative attachment points  risk bands  cede rates  and ceding commissions 
earned premiums increased to million for from million for the difference between net written premiums and earned premiums is the change in the unearned premium reserve 
our unearned premium liability increased million from december  to december  compared to an increase of million from december  to december  the growth in was the result of growth in sales of products with premiums paid on an annual basis during that year 
direct written premium from the annual premium product represented of direct premium written in both and as mentioned earlier  assuming interest rates do not decline  we anticipate our persistency will continue to improve 
this improvement should have a positive effect on renewal earned premiums and total earned premiums in net investment income for grew over primarily due to the growth in average invested assets  partially offset by a decline in portfolio yields 
average invested assets at cost or amortized cost grew by in over as a result of the investment of cash flows from operations throughout the year 
our investment portfolio tax equivalent yield declined to at december  from at december  net realized investment gains losses  except for write downs on other than temporarily impaired securities  are the result of our discretionary dispositions of investment securities in the context of our overall portfolio management strategies and are likely to vary significantly from period to period 
write downs on other than temporarily securities were approximately million in compared to million in see further discussion of impairment write downs in the realized gains  losses and impairments section below 
losses and expenses net losses and loss adjustment expenses net of reinsurance recoveries increased in over this increase was due to the growth in the number of delinquencies and paid losses and is reflective of our overall growth of insurance in force and the seasoning of our in force business 
net paid losses  excluding loss adjustment expenses  increased to million for from million for  an increase of 
average severity direct paid losses divided by number of claims paid for all loans combined was approximately  for compared to  for however  the average severity on structured bulk loans was  for compared to  for the following table provides detail on direct paid losses for our flow business and structured bulk business for the years ended december  and in thousands direct losses paid flow business structured bulk business total the increase in paid losses is consistent with our expectations as a greater amount of our insurance in force reaches its anticipated highest claim frequency years 
due to the growth of our inforce business  we believe direct paid losses for both flow and structured bulk business will continue to increase in  although somewhat less than the growth rate 
net losses and loss adjustment expenses also includes the change in reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the following table shows further detail about the company s loss reserves at december  and broken out by flow business and structured bulk business in thousands flow business reserves for reported defaults reserves for defaults incurred but not reported total flow structured bulk business reserves for reported defaults reserves for defaults incurred but not reported total structured bulk transactions reserve for loss adjustment expenses total reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses in and  and  respectively  of our structured bulk production was structured with deductibles that put us in the second loss position  which we expect to moderate the loss development in the bulk portfolio 
prior to the fourth quarter of  there was only a small amount of reported defaults on the structured bulk production that included deductibles 
beginning in fourth quarter as the loss development pattern began to emerge on these books with deductibles  we began taking these deductibles into consideration when calculating our reserves and did not establish reserves for those claims on which we were in the second loss position 
the following table shows our loss ratios the ratio of incurred losses and loss adjustment expense to premiums earned for our flow business and our structured bulk business for the years ended december  and loss ratio flow business structured bulk business total the increase in the loss ratio for the flow business shown above is consistent with our expectations  again  as a greater amount of our insurance in force reaches its anticipated highest claim frequency years 
for our structured bulk business  the deductible structures put in place over the past two years have caused the decline in the loss ratio 
as of december  and  approximately and of our insurance in force was originated in the previous months 
based upon our experience and industry data  we believe that claims incidence for flow business is generally highest in the third through sixth years after loan origination 
we believe that the period of highest claims incidence for structured bulk transactions is generally highest in the second through fourth years after loan origination 
changes in the economic environment could accelerate paid and incurred loss development 
due to the inherent uncertainty of future premium levels  losses  economic conditions  and other factors that affect earnings  it is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty the impact of such higher claim frequencies on future earnings 
the factors most significant to our loss development will continue to be the level of new delinquent loans and their subsequent cure performance 
because of the growth of our inforce business  we believe the number of loans in default for both flow and structured bulk business will increase  although moderating from the growth level 
the following table indicates the growth of the number of loans in default at december loans in default flow business structured bulk business with deductibles without deductibles total structured bulk total amortization of dac decreased by in from and is reflective of the increase in persistency experienced in a full discussion of the impact of persistency on dac amortization is included in the deferred policy acquisition costs section below 
the increase in other operating expenses in over of is relatively consistent with our growth in the insurance in force 
further  we experienced increased expenses in related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley requirements and other compliance oriented expenses that we do not expect to repeat at the same level in we have made substantial investments in technology that allow for growth in both our flow and structured bulk business without proportional increases in operating expenses 
the expense ratio ratio of the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses to net premiums written for was compared to for the improvement in the expense ratio for was due primarily to the decrease in dac amortization expense mentioned above 
our effective tax rate was for and for the decrease in the effective tax rate is due primarily to an increase in tax exempt interest resulting from a higher percentage of assets being invested in tax preferred municipal securities 
we expect our effective tax rate to remain near current levels or increase slightly as we expect earned premium to grow faster than tax preferred income 
compared to net income for increased over to million 
net income per share on a diluted basis increased to for from per share for this improvement in net income was driven by a increase in earned premiums and a increase in net investment income 
net income for included after tax net realized investment gains of million  while net income for included after tax net realized investment losses of million 
production and in force total insurance written in was billion compared to billion in  an increase of 
flow insurance written for increased to billion from billion in this increase was primarily the result of expanding relationships with national lenders  strong demand for risk sharing arrangements and other product offerings  and a lower interest rate environment that contributed to a very strong refinance market 
insurance written in attributable to structured bulk transactions totaled billion compared to billion in the jump in structured bulk transactions written was driven by a robust growth in the overall bulk marketplace in coupled with our renewed strategic commitment to that market 
as described above  insurance written attributed to structured bulk transactions is likely to vary significantly from period to period 
the following table provides estimates of our national market share of net new primary insurance written based on information available from the industry association and other public sources year ended december flow business structured bulk transactions total total direct insurance in force reached billion at december   compared to billion at december  significant refinance activity in and resulted in a high level of policy cancellations that substantially offset the impact that the high level of insurance written had on in force growth 
as a result  insurance in force increased by only billion in  even though insurance written during was billion 
the following table shows our persistency rates for our flow and structured bulk business at december  and flow structured bulk total refinance activity was of insurance written in compared to in the high level of refinance activity and the resulting decrease in persistency was reflective of the low interest rate environment that was in place during the following table presents the fico credit score distribution of our risk in force for both flow and structured bulk business at december  and structured flow bulk credit score less than credit score between and credit score greater than revenues total direct premiums written were million for  an increase of compared to million for net premiums written increased by to million in from million for contributing to the increase in premiums written for were significant writings under our annual premium payment plan

approximately of direct flow insurance in force of total insurance in force was subject to captive reinsurance arrangements at december   compared to of total insurance in force at december  this increase was due primarily to the increased market penetration of our captive reinsurance arrangements and the high level of refinance activity in  as policies that were previously not subject to captive reinsurance arrangements refinanced and new policies issued were subject to captive reinsurance arrangements 
earned premiums increased to million for from million for the difference between net written premiums and earned premiums in was due to the significant writings of our annual premium product and the related increase in the unearned premium reserve 
our unearned premium liability increased to million at december   from million at december  direct written premium from the annual premium product represented of direct premium written in compared to of direct premium written in the growth in written and earned premiums resulted from strong levels of new insurance written offset by the impact of a low level of persistency and by the increase in ceded premiums 
net investment income for was million  a increase over million in average invested assets at cost or amortized cost grew by million to million for the year ended december   an increase of from million for the increase in average invested assets was attributable to the investment of funds derived from cash flows from operations in the percentage increase in net investment income was much lower than the percentage increase in invested assets primarily due to a decrease in investment yields 
we reported million of net realized investment gains during and million of net realized investment losses during net realized gains during included approximately million of impairment writedowns 
the writedowns primarily involved securities in the automotive  energy  and pharmaceutical sectors as well as a commercial mortgage backed security

amortization of dac increased by to million in from million for the increase reflects growth in dac related to the expansion of our insurance in force and accelerated amortization due to higher cancellations from refinance activity in low persistency levels during and resulted in additional amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs through dynamic adjustments totaling million in and million in other operating expenses decreased to million for from million for the expense ratio for was compared to for the expense ratio for improved because other operating expenses decreased and net written premium increased  offset somewhat by the accelerated amortization of dac 
our effective tax rate was for and for the decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to an increase in tax exempt interest resulting from a higher percentage of assets being invested in tax preferred municipal securities 
significant customers our objective is controlled  profitable growth in both the flow and bulk arenas while adhering to our risk management strategies 
our strategy is to continue our focus on national lenders while maintaining the productive relationships that we have built with regional lenders 
our ten largest customers were responsible for   and of flow insurance written during   and  respectively 
our two largest customers were responsible for   and of flow insurance written during   and  respectively 
the loss of one or more of these significant customers could have an adverse effect on our business 
financial position total assets increased to million at december   a growth over the same date in  primarily the result of growth in invested assets 
total liabilities increased to million at december   from million in  primarily driven by an increase in deferred tax liabilities 
this section identifies several items on our balance sheet that are important in the overall understanding of our financial position 
these items include deferred policy acquisition costs  prepaid federal income tax and related deferred income taxes  and loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
our mortgage insurance operations and reserves are primarily supported by our investment portfolio 
the majority of our assets are contained in the investment portfolio 
a separate investments section follows the financial position section and reviews our investment portfolio  key portfolio management strategies  and methodologies by which we manage credit risk 
deferred policy acquisition costs costs expended to acquire new business are capitalized as dac and recognized as expense over the anticipated premium paying life of the policy 
we employ a dynamic model that calculates amortization of dac separately for each book year of business 
the model relies on assumptions that we make based upon historical industry experience and our own unique experience regarding the annual persistency development of each book year 
persistency is the most important assumption utilized in determining the timing of reported amortization expense reflected in the income statement and the carrying value of dac on the balance sheet 
a change in the assumed persistency can impact the current and future amortization expense as well as the carrying value on the balance sheet 
our model accelerates dac amortization through a dynamic adjustment when actual persistency for a book year is lower than the estimated persistency originally utilized in the model 
this dynamic adjustment is capped at the levels assumed in the models  and we do not decrease dac amortization below the levels assumed in the model when persistency increases above those levels 
the dynamic adjustment effectively adjusts the estimated policy life originally utilized in the model to a revised policy life based upon the current actual persistency 
in as the amount of structured bulk transactions grew  we revised our dac models to separate the costs capitalized and the amortization streams between transactions arising from structured bulk and the flow business 
generally  structured bulk transactions have significantly less acquisition costs associated with the production of the business and they also have a shorter original estimated policy life 
we apply the dynamic adjustment utilizing the same methodology to the separate structured bulk dac models 
at december  and  net unamortized dac relating to structured bulk transactions amounted to and of the total dac on the balance sheet 
the following table shows the dac asset for the previous three years and the effect of persistency on amortization dollar amounts in thousands dac asset balance beginning of year costs capitalized amortization normal amortization dynamic adjustment total amortization balance end of year annual persistency low persistency levels during the past three years have caused accelerated dac amortization 
if persistency continues to improve in  we would expect the accelerated dac amortization to continue to moderate  depending on the level of improvement 
otherwise  we will continue to experience increased dac amortization through the dynamic adjustment 
differences in persistency in the flow and structured bulk portfolios will not have the same impact on their respective dac amortization because of the lower balance and the shorter estimated policy life on structured bulk transactions 
see further information on the accounting for dac in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
prepaid federal income taxes and deferred income taxes we purchase ten year non interest bearing united states mortgage guaranty tax and loss bonds tax and loss bonds in lieu of paying current federal income taxes to take advantage of a special contingency reserve deduction for mortgage guaranty companies 
we record these bonds on our balance sheet as prepaid federal income taxes 
purchases of tax and loss bonds are essentially a prepayment of federal income taxes that will become due in ten years when the contingency reserve is released  and the tax and loss bonds mature 
prepaid income taxes were million and million at december  and the change from year to year approximates the change in deferred income tax liability for the year 
deferred income taxes are provided for the differences in reporting taxable income in the financial statements and on the tax return 
these cumulative differences are enumerated in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the largest cumulative difference is the special contingency reserve deduction for mortgage insurers mentioned above 
the remainder of the deferred tax liability has primarily arisen from book and tax reporting differences related to deferred policy acquisition costs and unrealized investment gains 
reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses we calculate our best estimate of reserves to provide for the estimated costs of settling claims on loans reported in default and loans in default that are in the process of being reported to us  utilizing various factors that have been developed and tested over time 
with respect to loans reported in default  loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are established when notices of default are received 
consistent with industry practices  we do not establish loss reserves for future claims on insured loans that are not currently in default 
our reserving methodology focuses on the determination of a loss severity factor and a projected claim rate frequency factor for each reported delinquent loan category at the valuation date 
we analyze various components in determining the loss severity factor  including the baseline severity  policy year  geography and salvage recoverable 
in determining the frequency factor  we focus our analysis on the policy year policy age  the number of previous reported defaults to identify chronic late payers  and the number of months that the payment is past due 
we utilize historical long term performance in our reserving methodology and adjust our factors for current economic events when we believe the events will significantly impact the long term loss development 
for these reasons  there may be fluctuations in the reserve factors utilized from year to year 
further  we analyze individual defaults within structured bulk transactions to determine whether the business was written with a deductible that would put us in a second loss position 
until the projected loss reserve for the aggregate defaults within a transaction structured with a deductible exceed a pre established threshold  no reserves are established 
because the estimate for loss reserves is sensitive to the estimates of claims frequency and severity  we perform analyses to test the reasonableness of the best estimate generated by the loss reserve process 
adjustments to reserve estimates are reflected in the financial statements in the periods in which the adjustments are made 
our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves increased to million at december  from million at december  note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contains a roll forward of these amounts for the last three years showing the incurred losses and the actual payments for the current and prior years 
during the fourth quarter of  claim severity had increased  particularly on paid claims related to structured bulk transactions from the and book years 
at that time  we concluded that these extremely limited amount of actual claim payments related to the and bulk book years did not constitute a long term trend and we did not adjust the severity factors during during of the first half of  we continued to experience adverse severity trends on claims paid  particularly on the and structured bulk book years 
additionally  during the first half of  we settled some flow claims with extended delinquency periods at amounts that exceeded our expectations based upon the factors in place at the end of 
as a result of these two factors reflecting both prior structured bulk and flow books  we increased our severity factors utilized in our reserve calculations in this action also contributed to the recognized deficiency in a redundancy in reserves is shown for and these redundancies resulted principally from settling case basis reserves on default notices occurring in prior years for amounts less than expected 
over of our insurance in force was written within the last two years 
experience indicates that years three through six have the highest incidence of defaults 
because of this fact  we expect loss reserves to continue to grow  reflecting the growth and aging of our insurance in force 
however  we anticipate the increase in the loss reserves to be moderated somewhat as the number of structured bulk transactions with deductibles incorporated into the risk structure continues to increase 
based upon the current and reasonable estimates of future economic conditions  we expect cash flows from operations to be sufficient to cover the anticipated increase in expected claim payments 
the following table shows default statistics as of december   and total business number of insured loans in force number of loans in default percentage of loans in default default rate flow business number of insured loans in force number of loans in default percentage of loans in default structured bulk business number of insured loans in force number of loans in default with deductibles without deductibles percentage of loans in default alt a business number of insured loans in force number of loans in default percentage of loans in default calculated based on total number of loans in default alt a is included in flow and structured bulk business amounts above the number of loans in default reported above includes all reported delinquencies that are in excess of two payments in arrears at the reporting date and all reported delinquencies that were previously in excess of two payments in arrears and have not been brought current 
the increase in the default rate for flow business is attributable primarily to the maturing of the flow portfolio for reasons consistent with the increase in reserves explained above 
the default occurrences for both flow business and structured bulk business are consistent with management s expectation 
investment portfolio portfolio description we manage our investment portfolio to meet or exceed regulatory and rating agency requirements 
we invest for the long term  and most of our investments are held until they mature 
our investment portfolio includes primarily fixed income securities  and the majority of these are tax preferred state and municipal bonds 
we have established a formal investment policy that describes our overall quality and diversification objectives and limits 
our investment policies and strategies are subject to change depending upon regulatory  economic  and market conditions as well as our existing financial condition and operating requirements  including our tax position 
while we invest for the long term and most of our investments are held until they mature  we classify our entire investment portfolio as available for sale 
this classification allows us the flexibility to dispose of securities in order to meet our investment strategies and operating requirements 
all investments are carried on our balance sheet at fair value 
the following schedule shows the growth and diversification of our investment portfolio dollars in thousands 
december  december  amount percent amount percent fixed maturity securities us government obligations mortgage backed bonds state and municipal bonds corporate bonds total fixed maturities equity securities total available for sale securities short term investments we seek to provide liquidity in our investment portfolio through cash equivalent investments and through diversification and investment in publicly traded securities 
we attempt to maintain a level of liquidity and duration in our investment portfolio consistent with our business outlook and the expected timing  direction  and degree of changes in interest rates 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements that describes the scheduled maturity of our fixed maturity investments 
the duration to maturity of the fixed maturity portfolio was years at december  compared to years at december  another way that we manage risk and liquidity is to limit our exposure on individual securities

average investments at cost or amortized cost pre tax net investment income effective pre tax yield tax equivalent yield to maturity pre tax realized investment gain loss the drop in the effective pre tax yield shown above reflects the decrease in new money rates available for investment coupled with our strategies to increase the overall credit quality of the portfolio and increase our investment in state and municipal bonds 
unrealized gains and losses the following table summarizes by category our unrealized gains and losses in our securities portfolio at december  in thousands cost or gross gross amortized unrealized unrealized fair cost gains losses value fixed maturity securities us government obligations mortgage backed bonds state and municipal bonds corporate bonds subtotal  fixed maturities equity securities total securities these unrealized gains and losses do not necessarily represent future gains or losses that we will realize 
changing conditions related to specific securities  overall market interest rates  or credit spreads  as well as our decisions concerning the timing of a sale  may impact values we ultimately realize 
we monitor unrealized losses through further analysis according to maturity date  credit quality  individual creditor exposure and the length of time the individual security has continuously been in an unrealized loss position 
of the gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities shown above  approximately  related to bonds with a maturity date in excess of ten years 
the largest individual unrealized loss on any one security at december  was approximately  on a bond with an amortized cost of million 
gross unrealized gains and losses at december  were million and million  respectively 
credit risk credit risk is inherent in an investment portfolio 
we manage this risk through a structured approach to internal investment quality guidelines and diversification while assessing the effects of the changing economic landscape 
one way we attempt to limit the inherent credit risk in the portfolio is to maintain investments with high ratings 
the following table shows our investment portfolio by credit ratings dollars in thousands 
december  december  amount percent amount percent fixed maturities us treasury and agency bonds aaa aa a bbb bb b ccc and lower not rated total fixed maturities equities aaa aa a bbb bb b c not rated total equities further  we regularly review our investment portfolio to identify securities that may have suffered impairments in value that will not be recovered  termed potentially distressed securities 
in identifying potentially distressed securities  we first screen for all securities that have a fair value to cost or amortized cost ratio of less than 
additionally  as part of this identification process  we utilize the following information length of time the fair value was below amortized cost industry factors or conditions related to a geographic area negatively affecting the security downgrades by a rating agency past due interest or principal payments or other violation of covenants deterioration of the overall financial condition of the specific issuer in analyzing our potentially distressed securities list for other than temporary impairments  we pay special attention to securities that have been on the list for a period greater than six months 
our ability and intent to retain the investment for a sufficient time to recover its value is also considered 
we assume that  absent reliable contradictory evidence  a security that is potentially distressed for a continuous period greater than nine months has incurred an other than temporary impairment 
such reliable contradictory evidence might include  among other factors  a liquidation analysis performed by our investment advisors or outside consultants  improving financial performance of the issuer  or valuation of underlying assets specifically pledged to support the credit 
when we conclude that a decline is other than temporary  the security is written down to fair value through a charge to realized investment gains and losses 
we adjust the amortized cost for securities that have experienced other than temporary impairments to reflect fair value at the time of the impairment 
we consider factors that lead to an other than temporary impairment of a particular security in order to determine whether these conditions have impacted other similar securities 
of the approximate  of gross unrealized losses at december   no securities had a fair value to cost or amortized cost ratio of less than and none were included in our potentially distressed securities list mentioned above 
information about unrealized gains and losses is subject to changing conditions 
securities with unrealized gains and losses will fluctuate  as will those securities that we identify as potentially distressed 
our current evaluation of other than temporary impairments reflects our intent to hold certain securities for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair value 
however  we may subsequently decide to sell certain of these securities in future periods as a result of facts and circumstances impacting a specific security 
if we make the decision to dispose of a security with an unrealized loss  we will write down the security to its fair value if we have not sold it by the end of the reporting period 
realized losses and impairments realized losses include both write downs of securities with other than temporary impairments and losses from the sales of securities 
during  we wrote down six securities by a total of approximately  further details on the significant write downs in are as follows approximately  was a write down on preferred stock in an international airline for which the value had fluctuated below of amortized cost for over a year 
the write down resulted from our assessment that the security was other than temporarily impaired because of a reduction in credit quality by rating agencies 
we later sold this security in and realized a small gain 
the circumstances surrounding this impairment did not impact other securities in our portfolio 
approximately  was a write down on common stock of a pharmaceutical company for which the value had fluctuated below of amortized cost after the company had to cease sales of one of its major products due to alleged health risks 
rating agencies then reduced the credit ratings for this company 
we sold this security in the fourth quarter following the write down at an amount that approximated its carrying value after the write down 
the circumstances surrounding this impairment did not impact other securities in our portfolio 
during  we wrote down five securities by a total of approximately  further details on the significant write downs in are as follows approximately  was a write down on common stock of an automobile manufacturer for which the value had fluctuated below of amortized cost for more than six months 
our assessment deemed that the security would not significantly recover in value over our anticipated holding period 
this security was later sold at an amount that approximated its carrying value after the write down 
the circumstances surrounding this impairment did not impact other securities in our portfolio 
approximately  was a write down on common stock of an energy provider for which the value had fluctuated below of amortized cost for more than six months 
our assessment deemed that the security would not significantly recover in value over our anticipated holding period 
the circumstances surrounding this impairment did not impact other securities in our portfolio 
approximately  was a write down on a bond issue collateralized by high yield securities that continued to experience excessive defaults on its underlying securities 
the circumstances surrounding this impairment did not impact other securities in our portfolio 
approximately  was a write down on common stock of a pharmaceutical company for which patents on various products were expiring 
the market value of the equity had fluctuated below of its cost 
we subsequently sold these securities at an amount that approximated its carrying value after the write down 
the circumstances surrounding this impairment did not impact other securities in our portfolio 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of operating funds consist primarily of premiums written and investment income 
operating cash flow is applied primarily to the payment of claims  interest  expenses  and prepaid federal income taxes in the form of tax and loss bonds 
we generated positive cash flow from operating activities of million in compared to million for and million for the increase in cash flow from operating activities in reflects the growth in premiums and investment income partially offset by an increase in losses and other operating expenses paid 
our business does not routinely require significant capital expenditures other than for enhancements to our computer systems and technological capabilities 
positive cash flows are invested pending future payments of claims and expenses 
cash flow shortfalls  if any  could be funded through sales of short term investments and other investment portfolio securities 
we have no existing lines of credit due to the sufficiency of the operating funds from the sources described above 
the insurance laws of the state of illinois impose certain restrictions on dividends that an insurance subsidiary can pay the parent company 
these restrictions  based on statutory accounting practices  include requirements that dividends may be paid only out of statutory earned surplus and that limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of the illinois insurance department 
there have been no dividends paid by the insurance subsidiaries to the parent company 
further  there are no restrictions or requirements for capital support arrangements between the parent company and triad or its subsidiaries 
we cede business to captive reinsurance subsidiaries of certain mortgage lenders captives  primarily under excess of loss reinsurance agreements 
generally  reinsurance recoverables on loss reserves and unearned premiums ceded to these captives are backed by trust funds or letters of credit 
total stockholders equity increased to million at december   from million at december  this increase resulted primarily from net income of million and additional paid in capital of million resulting from the exercise of employee stock options and the related tax benefit 
total statutory policyholders surplus for our insurance subsidiaries increased to million at december   from million at december  the primary difference between statutory policyholders surplus and equity computed under generally accepted accounting principles is the statutory contingency reserve 
the balance in the statutory contingency reserve was million at december   compared to million at december  statutory capital  for the purpose of computing the net risk in force to statutory capital ratio  includes both policyholders surplus and the contingency reserve 
statutory capital amounted to million at december   compared to million at december  triad s ability to write insurance depends on the maintenance of its financial strength ratings and the adequacy of its capital in relation to risk in force 
a significant reduction of capital or a significant increase in risk may impair triad s ability to write additional insurance 
a number of states also generally limit triad s risk to capital ratio to to as of december   triad s risk to capital ratio was to as compared to to at december  the risk to capital ratio is calculated using net risk in force  which takes into account risk ceded under reinsurance arrangements  including captive risk sharing arrangements as well as any applicable stop loss limits  as the numerator  and statutory capital as the denominator 
triad is rated aa by both standard poor s ratings services and fitch ratings and aa by moody s investors service 
s p has not changed its negative rating outlook for the us private mortgage insurance industry that was issued in july of in december  fitch maintained its negative rating outlook for the us private mortgage insurance industry 
currently  fitch  s p  and moody s all report a stable ratings outlook for triad 
a reduction in triad s rating or outlook could adversely affect our operations 
fannie mae has revised its approval requirements for mortgage insurers 
the new rules require prior approval by fannie mae for many of triad s activities and new products  allow for other approved types of mortgage insurers rated less than aa  and give fannie mae increased rights to revise the eligibility standards of mortgage insurers 
we do not see any material impact on our current or future operations as a result of the new rules  although a material impact could still occur if fannie mae were to begin to utilize mortgage insurers rated below aa or revise eligibility standards of mortgage insurers in a way that would be adverse to triad 
the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo issued its risk based capital rules for fannie mae and freddie mac in the first quarter of the regulation provides capital guidelines for fannie mae and freddie mac in connection with their use of various types of credit protection counterparties including a more preferential capital credit for insurance from a aaa rated private mortgage insurer than for insurance from a aa rated private mortgage insurer 
the phase in period for ofheo s risk based capital rules is ten years 
we do not believe the new risk based capital rules had an adverse impact on our financial condition through nor that these rules will have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition in the future 
however  if the risk based capital rules result in future changes to the preferences of fannie mae and freddie mac regarding their use of the various types of credit enhancements or their choice of mortgage insurers based on their credit rating  our financial condition could be significantly harmed 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations we lease office facilities  automobiles  and office equipment under operating leases with minimum lease commitments that range from one to ten years 
we have no capitalized leases or material purchase commitments 
our long term debt has a single maturity date of the following schedule represents our aggregate contractual obligations as of december  in thousands 
payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt operating leases other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total the other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap category above is comprised of our reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
market risk exposure fixed maturity securities represented approximately of our invested assets at december  while the fair value of these fixed rate securities generally bears an inverse relationship to changes in prevailing market interest rates  a change in market interest rates would not immediately impact earnings because we generally hold these securities until maturity 
however  a decrease in market interest rates generally will have the effect of initiating an early call provision of those securities possessing such provisions 
the proceeds relating to the early called securities in a decreasing interest rate environment generally are invested in lower yielding investments that would ultimately decrease earnings 
our long term debt matures in with no early call or put provisions and bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum 
the fair value of this debt is sensitive to changes in prevailing interest rates  however  a change in rates would not impact earnings 
we believe that a increase or decrease in market interest rates is reasonable for the upcoming year 
a relative increase or decrease in market interest rates that affect our financial instruments would not have a material impact on earnings during the next fiscal year
