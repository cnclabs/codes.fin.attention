item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 

table of contents government regulation regarding the environment as a result of our manufacturing and assembly operations  our businesses are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws  as well as other legal requirements relating to the generation  storage  transport and disposal of materials 
these laws include  without limitation  the resource conservation and recovery act  the clean air act  the clean water act and the comprehensive environmental response and compensation and liability act 
we currently do not anticipate any materially adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations as a result of our compliance with federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws 
however  risk of environmental liability and charges associated with maintaining compliance with environmental laws is inherent in the nature of our manufacturing operations and there is no assurance that material liabilities or charges could not arise 
during the year ended december   we capitalized less than million related to environmental and safety control facilities and we also incurred and expensed an additional million related to environmental and safety control facilities 
we also expect to capitalize less than million during the year ending december  we expect to incur and expense related charges of approximately million during the year ending december  item properties we maintain major facilities worldwide  including significant manufacturing operations located in the united states  canada  western europe and the people s republic of china 
many of these facilities contain sales offices or warehouses from which we ship finished goods to customers  distributors and commissioned representative organizations 
our executive office is located in burlington  massachusetts 
the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products group has facilities located in the united states  canada  germany  france  the netherlands  and the united kingdom 
properties in ronkonkoma  new york  berlin  connecticut  and spartanburg  south carolina  are leased 
the energy products group has facilities located in the united states  canada  italy and the people s republic of china 
properties in nerviano  italy  naviglio  italy  edmonton  alberta  canada  beaumont  texas  a distribution center in oklahoma city  oklahoma  and suzhou  people s republic of china are leased 
certain of our facilities are subject to collateral assignments under loan agreements with long term lenders 
in general  we believe that our properties  including machinery  tools and equipment  are in good condition  are well maintained  and are adequate and suitable for their intended uses 
our manufacturing facilities generally operate five days per week on one or two shifts 
we believe our manufacturing capacity could be increased by working additional shifts and weekends and by successful implementation of our on going lean manufacturing initiatives 
item legal proceedings we  like other worldwide manufacturing companies  are subject to a variety of potential liabilities connected with our business operations  including potential liabilities and expenses associated with possible product defects or failures and compliance with environmental laws 
we maintain liability insurance coverage which we believe to be consistent with industry practices 
nonetheless  such 
table of contents insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us fully against substantial damage claims  which may arise from product defects and failures or from environmental liability 
like many other manufacturers of fluid control products  we have been named as defendants in a growing number of product liability actions brought on behalf of individuals who seek compensation for their alleged exposure to airborne asbestos fibers 
in particular  our subsidiaries  leslie  spence  and hoke  collectively have been named as defendants or third party defendants in asbestos related claims brought on behalf of approximately  plaintiffs typically against anywhere from to defendants 
in some instances  we also have been named individually and or as successor in interest to one or more of these subsidiaries 
these cases have been brought in state courts in alabama  california  connecticut  georgia  maryland  michigan  mississippi  montana  new jersey  new york  rhode island  texas  utah  washington and wyoming with the vast majority of claimants having brought their claims in mississippi 
the cases brought on behalf of the vast majority of claimants seek unspecified compensatory and punitive damages against all defendants in the aggregate 
however  the complaints filed on behalf of claimants who do seek specified compensatory and punitive damages typically seek millions or tens of millions of dollars in damages against the aggregate of defendants 
any components containing asbestos formerly used in leslie  spence and hoke products were entirely internal to the product and  we believe  would not give rise to ambient asbestos dust during normal operation or during normal inspection and repair procedures 
moreover  to date  our insurers have been paying the vast majority of the costs associated with the defense of these actions  particularly with respect to spence and hoke for which insurance has paid all defense costs to date 
as we previously have disclosed  due to certain gaps in historical insurance coverage  leslie had been responsible for in excess of of the defense costs associated with asbestos actions 
however  during we discovered evidence of additional policy coverage 
as a result  during the first quarter of we negotiated a revised cost sharing understanding with leslie s insurers which results in a lowering of leslie s responsibility to of defense costs 
in light of the foregoing  we currently believe that we have no basis on which to conclude that these cases will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  due to the nature and number of variables associated with asbestos related claims  such as the rate at which new claims may be filed  the availability of insurance policies to continue to recover certain of our costs relating to the defense and payment of these claims  the impact of bankruptcies of other companies currently or historically defending asbestos claims including our co defendants  the uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards  the type and severity of the disease alleged to be suffered by each claimant  and increases in the expense of medical treatment  we are unable to reliably estimate the ultimate costs to us of these claims 
we are currently a party to or otherwise involved in various administrative or legal proceedings under federal  state or local environmental laws or regulations involving a number of sites  in some cases as a participant in a group of potentially responsible parties  referred to as prps 
two of these sites  the sharkey and combe landfills in new jersey  are listed on the national priorities list 
with respect to the sharkey landfill in new jersey  we have been allocated of the remediation costs  an amount that is not material to us 
with respect to the combe landfill  we have settled both the federal government s claim and the state of new jersey s claim for an amount that is immaterial to us 
moreover  our insurers have covered defense and settlement costs to date with respect to the sharkey and combe landfills 
in addition  we have also been named as a prp with respect to the solvent recovery service of new 
table of contents england site and the old southington landfill site  both in connecticut 
these sites are also on the national priorities list but  with respect to both sites  we have the right to indemnification from the prior owners of the affected subsidiaries 
we also have been identified as a prp with respect to the lightman drum company site in new jersey and  in this matter  we also have the right to indemnification from the former owners of the affected subsidiary 
based on currently available information  we believe that any share of clean up costs at these sites attributable to us should not be material  particularly given our indemnification rights against the respective former owners 
we have reviewed all of our pending judicial and legal proceedings  reasonably anticipated costs and expenses in connection with such proceedings  and availability and limits of our insurance coverage  and we have established reserves that we believe are appropriate in light of those outcomes that we believe are probable and estimable at this time 
item submission of matters to a vote of security holders there were no matters submitted during the fourth quarter of the year covered by this report to a vote of security holders through solicitation of proxies or otherwise

we advise you to read further about certain of these and other risk factors set forth under the caption certain risk factors that may affect future results in this annual report 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
overview circor international  inc is a leading provider of valves and fluid control products for the instrumentation  fluid regulation and petrochemical markets 
we offer one of the industry s broadest and most diverse range of products a range that allows us to supply end users with a wide array of valves and component products for fluid systems 
we have organized the company into two segments instrumentation thermal fluid controls products and energy products 
the instrumentation thermal fluid controls products segment serves our broadest variety of end markets  including military and commercial aerospace  chemical processing  marine  power generation  hvac systems  food and beverage processing  and other general industrial markets 
the energy products segment primarily serves the oil and gas exploration  production and distribution markets 
apart from monitoring our key competitors  our businesses pay close attention to changes in market conditions  customer order rates  operating margins  and levels of working capital in order to help improve financial results and make more efficient use of assets 

table of contents our growth strategy includes both internal product development and strategic acquisitions that complement and extend our current offering of engineered flow control products 
during the last four years  we have made nine acquisitions that extended our product offerings 
eight of these acquisitions were in our instrumentation thermal fluid controls products segment 
in  our acquisitions of dqs and tsi provided us with a larger presence in the analytical sampling market and our acquisition of loud in january provided us with complementary aerospace component and subassembly manufacturing capabilities 
the other acquisition  made in april  was the addition of mallard to our energy products segment 
regarding financial results  despite a lower volume of shipments to large international oil and gas projects  incurring significant new costs to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  and higher metals costs for raw materials  we benefited from customer order growth in certain key end markets we serve  we implemented broad based price increases to customers for the first time in recent years  we completed three facility consolidations  we benefited from three acquisitions  dqs and tsi acquired in the fourth quarter and mallard acquired in april  and we made a fourth quarter business decision to lower future inventory carrying costs by consolidating warehousing and disposing of certain slow moving inventory in cash flow from operating activities in was a cash source of million 
we believe our largest opportunity to generate increased cash flow is by further reducing our inventories 
we have engaged a consulting firm to assist us with implementing lean sigma operating principles  beginning in with the assistance of this consulting firm and the implementation of lean sigma operating principles we expect to improve our asset turns  develop new strategies that should help us systemically change our order fulfillment processes and reduce inventories over the next few years 
we maintained a position of having more cash than debt as of december   after funding our april acquisition of mallard and october scheduled pay down of our senior notes  which required cash payments of million  and million  respectively 
basis of presentation all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
certain prior period financial statement amounts have been reclassified to conform to currently reported presentations 
we monitor our business in two segments instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products and energy products 
we operate and report financial information using a week fiscal year ending december the data periods contained within our quarterly reports on form q reflect the results of operations for the week  week and week periods which generally end on the sunday nearest the calendar quarter end date 
critical accounting policies the following discussion of accounting policies is intended to supplement the section summary of significant accounting policies presented in note to our consolidated financial statements 
these 
table of contents policies were selected because they are broadly applicable within our operating units 
the expenses and accrued liabilities or allowances related to certain of these policies are initially based on our best estimates at the time of original entry in our accounting records 
adjustments are recorded when our actual experience  or new information concerning our expected experience  differs from underlying initial estimates 
these adjustments could be material if our actual or expected experience were to change significantly in a short period of time 
we make frequent comparisons of actual experience and expected experience in order to mitigate the likelihood of material adjustments 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when products are delivered  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  no significant post delivery obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
shipping and handling costs invoiced to customers are recorded as components of revenues and the associated costs are recorded as cost of revenues 
allowance for inventory our net inventory balance was million as of december   compared to million as of december  our inventory allowance as of december  was million  compared with million as of december  we provide inventory allowances for excess  slow moving  and obsolete inventories determined primarily by estimates of future demand 
the allowance is measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and estimated market value and charged to the provision for inventory  which is a component of our cost of revenues 
assumptions about future demand is one of the primary factors utilized to estimate market value 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
our provision for inventory obsolescence was million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements  we could be required to increase our inventory allowances and our gross profit could be adversely affected 
in the fourth quarter of  we evaluated the impact of our programs initiated during the past two years to increase the proportion of our inventory purchased from less expensive suppliers  primarily in asia and eastern europe 
one result of our successful foreign sourcing programs is that we need less internal manufacturing and warehousing capability  particularly in north america 
in addition  our past practice has been to retain much of our inventory for extended periods  even utilizing extra warehousing facilities and resources 
after considering these factors  we concluded that it is more cost effective to dispose of selected inventory and reduce warehouse capacity than to incur ongoing carrying costs 
we decided to lower our costs by disposing of certain inventories and consolidating facilities 
as a result of that decision  we recorded a pre tax charge of million in the fourth quarter to write down our inventories  the majority of which we expect to dispose of in the first half of 
table of contents inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain adequate inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements 
purchase accounting in connection with our acquisitions  we assess and formulate a plan related to the future integration of the acquired entity 
this process begins during the due diligence process and is concluded within twelve months of the acquisition 
we accrue estimates for certain costs  related primarily to personnel reductions and facility closures or restructurings  anticipated at the date of acquisition  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
business combination and emerging issues task force issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
adjustments to these estimates are made during the acquisition allocation period  which is generally up to twelve months from the acquisition date as plans are finalized 
subsequent to the allocation period  costs incurred in excess of the recorded acquisition accruals are generally expensed as incurred and if accruals are not utilized for the intended purpose the excess is recorded as a reduction of period expense 
impairment analysis our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques for industrial manufacturing companies 
goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
the goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  was million  compared with million as of december  we perform goodwill impairment tests for each reporting unit on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances  if triggering events indicate impairment may have occurred 
in assessing the fair value of goodwill  we use our best estimates of future cash flows of operating activities and capital expenditures of the reporting unit  a discount rate  and the estimated terminal value for each reporting unit 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future due to changes in industry and market conditions  we may be required to record impairment charges 
based on impairment tests performed using independent third party valuations  there was no impairment in our goodwill in   or other long lived assets include property  plant  and equipment and intangibles with definite lives 
we perform impairment analyses of our other long lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired 
when the undiscounted estimated future cash flows are expected to be less than the carrying value of the assets being reviewed for impairment  the assets are written down to fair market value 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance 
our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate due to the impact of acquisition related costs  research and product development tax credits  extraterritorial income exclusion  state taxes  and the tax impact of non us operations 
our effective tax rate was   and for   and  respectively 
we believe past 
table of contents estimates of our effective rate were reasonable and accurate  being lowered after when goodwill amortization ended 
for  we expect an effective income tax rate of 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and vice versa 
changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof may also adversely affect out future effective tax rate 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain state net operating losses and state tax credits carried forward 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
if market conditions improve and future results of operations exceed our current expectations  our existing tax valuation allowances may be adjusted  resulting in future tax benefits 
alternatively  if market conditions deteriorate further or future results of operations are less than expected  future assessments may result in a determination that some or all of the deferred tax assets are not realizable 
as a result  we may need to establish additional tax valuation allowances for all or a portion of the gross deferred tax assets  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in various legal claims and legal proceedings  some of which may involve substantial dollar amounts 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position 
for more information related to our outstanding legal proceedings  see contingencies in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements as well as legal proceedings in part i item pension benefits we maintain pension benefit plans for our employees in the united states 
these plans include significant pension benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial valuations 
key assumptions are made in determining these obligations and related expenses  including expected rates of return on plan assets and discount rates 
for and  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate pension expenses was 
the discount rate used to estimate the net pension expenses for was compared to in the lower discount rate reflected the decline in global capital markets and interest rates 
the effect of lowering the discount rate assumption we utilized for raised our projected benefit obligation by approximately million and raised our pension expense by approximately million 

table of contents plan assets are comprised of equity investments of companies in the united states with large and small market capitalizations  fixed income securities issued by the united states government  or its agencies  and certain international equities 
there are no common shares of circor international  inc in the plan assets 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are being recognized over approximately an eleven year period  which represents the weighted average expected remaining service life of the employee group 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on assets 
at the end of  we had unrecognized net actuarial losses of million 
the fair value of the defined benefit plan assets at december  exceeded the estimated accumulated benefit obligations as a net result of the increases in global capital markets and cash contributions from the company  partially offset by the lower interest rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the benefit plans 
during  we made million in cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans 
in  we expect voluntary cash contributions to be from million to million  although global capital market and interest rate fluctuations will impact future funding requirements 
for  we will reduce our expected long term rate of return on plan assets by basis points to and we lowered our discount rate for pension liabilities by basis points to on a weighted average basis given the level of global interest rates 
the combined effect of these two assumption changes is expected to raise our projected benefit obligation by approximately million and raise pension expense by approximately million 
we will continue to evaluate our expected long term rates of return on plan assets and discount rates at least annually and make adjustments as necessary  such adjustments could change the pension and post retirement obligations and expenses in the future 
if the actual operation of the plans differ from the assumptions  additional contributions by us may be required 
if we are required to make significant contributions to fund the defined benefit plans  reported results could be materially and adversely affected and our cash flow available for other uses may be reduced 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in  many of the general industrial end markets we serve began to emerge from a multiple year slump 
the stronger foreign currencies such as the euro continued a positive effect on our financial results as well as the full year impact of the acquisitions of dqs and tsi purchased in the fourth quarter of we also acquired mallard control company in april which added to our financial results 
in  the majority of our businesses focused on trimming spending proportional to customer order rates  completing the consolidation of three facilities and closing a fourth facility  developing new products and improving customer service levels to maintain and increase market share 
in the fourth quarter  we evaluated the impact of our programs initiated during the past two years to increase the proportion of our inventory purchased from less expensive suppliers  primarily in asia and eastern europe 
one result of our successful foreign sourcing programs is that we need less internal manufacturing and warehousing capability  particularly in north america 
in addition  our past practice 
table of contents has been to retain much of our inventory for extended periods  even utilizing extra warehousing facilities and resources 
after considering these factors  we concluded that it is more cost effective to dispose of selected inventory and reduce warehouse capacity than to incur ongoing carrying costs 
we decided to lower our costs by disposing of certain inventories and consolidating facilities 
as a result of that decision  we recorded a pre tax charge of million in the fourth quarter to write down our inventories  the majority of which we expect to dispose of in the first half of as a result of these and other factors  net revenues increased over while operating income and net income decreased from the following tables set forth the results of operations  percentage of net revenues and the yearly percentage change in certain financial data for the years ended december  and in thousands year ended december  change net revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses special charges operating income other income expense interest expense  net other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income net revenues net revenues for the year ended december  increased by approximately million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net revenues for the year ended december  was attributable to the following in thousands segment total change acquisitions operations foreign exchange instrumentation thermal fluid controls energy total 
table of contents the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment accounted for and of net revenues for the year ended december  and december   respectively 
the energy products segment accounted for and of net revenues for the year ended december  and december   respectively 
the change in the composition of revenues was favorably influenced by foreign exchange rate changes and the incremental revenues added from the fourth quarter acquisitions of dqs and tsi in the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment  and the april acquisition of mallard in the energy products segment 
revenues in for both segments were helped by customer price increases implemented by most of our business units 
this was the first time in recent years that we had implemented broad based price increases across many of our business units as a response to rising metals costs for raw materials that we purchased in instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  revenues increased primarily due to the incremental million of revenue contributed by the acquisitions of dqs and tsi  plus million due to the effect of favorable foreign exchange rates changes 
the revenue increase from operations of million was primarily the result of higher revenues from aerospace product lines of million  partially offset by a million decrease in revenues from thermal fluid controls product sales to the maritime market 
we implemented customer price increases in most businesses in the second and third quarters of to help offset the rise in certain metal prices from vendors 
for  we expect a modest increase in orders on improvement in general economic conditions 
we expect a full year benefit in of approximately million to million in incremental revenues as a result of our january acquisition of loud 
energy products revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the net increase in revenues for this segment was the net result of the mallard acquisition which added million of revenues  favorable foreign exchange rate changes provided an additional million of revenue  partially offset by million of lower shipments to large international oil and gas projects during the second and third quarters of our expectations for are that the markets served by this segment should continue to be positive for new orders 
the april mallard acquisition is expected to add incremental revenues of million for the full year gross profit gross profit from the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of the incremental gross profit of million from the acquisitions of dqs and tsi in november and december the increase from acquisitions was supplemented by increases of million from the foreign exchange effect of the stronger euro and british pound sterling in the remaining gross profit decline of million from is the net result of several factors including lower unit volume to the maritime and general industrial customers  higher unit volume to aerospace customers  added manufacturing costs for three now completed plant consolidations  higher raw material costs due to rising metals prices partially offset by customer price increases instituted and affecting second half revenues  and a fourth quarter million charge for inventory on the business decision to change warehousing and inventory carrying practices 
we are expecting gross profit 
table of contents in to improve modestly from the full year levels 
the improvement is expected to come from diminished inefficiencies and fixed cost savings from the three completed facility consolidations  the full year impact of customer price increases  a modest rise in customer orders in aerospace and general industrial instrumentation markets and the loud acquisition  partially offset by possible raw material price increases 
gross profit for the energy products segment decreased a net million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  gross profit declined from from a million charge in the fourth quarter of  related to our decision to change our warehousing and inventory carrying practices  and by million from lower unit volume and unfavorable mix of shipments to large international oil and gas projects and higher raw material costs due to rising metals prices partially offset by customer price increases instituted and affecting second half revenues 
these negative factors were offset by gross profit increases of million from the mallard acquisition plus a million increase from the strengthened euro and canadian dollar 
gross profit in is expected to benefit from the full year impact of the mallard acquisition  lower inventory charges  continued foreign sourcing for lower cost inventory  an increase in sales volume to large international oil and gas projects  and the full year impact of customer price increases  partially offset by possible raw material price increases 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million  or of net revenues for the year ended december  from million  or of net revenues for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses for the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  increases were the result of million from the incremental expenses of our acquisitions in the fourth quarter of dqs and tsi  and an million increase due to changes in foreign exchange rates 
in  we expect instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment selling general and administrative expenses to increase by approximately primarily as a result of the january acquisition of loud 
energy products segment selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this increase was the net result of million of incremental costs due to our mallard acquisition and million of increases due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  partially offset by a net million in lower operating costs incurred in our north american operations 
corporate expenses increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily for compliance costs for the new requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of our efforts in entailed testing internal controls and documenting those test results at our most significant businesses 
corporate expenses in are expected to increase by million due to the new accounting rule  fasb statement no 
r shared base payment an amendment of fasb statement no 
and  which will require the expensing of certain stock options  effective the third quarter of the 
table of contents full year expense related to the expensing of the fair value of our existing stock options would be approximately million 
special charges special charges of million incurred during the twelve months ended december  were primarily related to the write down of a building classified as held for sale within our energy products segment 
during the third quarter it was determined that the fair value and other incremental costs to sell the building would result in a lower net realizable value of the asset held for sale 
special charges of less than million incurred during the first quarter were primarily severance and facility costs related to the announced closure and consolidation of a california facility within our instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment of million  million of other closure related items  offset by the gain on the sale of our ohio property of million  also within our instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment 
as a result of the closure of our california facility  employee positions were eliminated 
special charges of million incurred during the year ended december  were primarily related to incremental costs for the closure of an ohio facility within our instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment and a building write down within our energy products segment 
operating income the change in operating income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was as follows in thousands segment total change acquisitions operations foreign exchange instrumentation thermal fluid controls energy corporate total operating income for the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment for the year ended december  increased million  or  compared to the year ended december  the increase in operating income was due to incremental operating income from our dqs and tsi acquisitions of million and million of favorable foreign exchange rate movements and operational items of million primarily due to improved aerospace products performance 
these increases were offset by the fourth quarter inventory charge of million which related to changes in our warehousing and inventory carrying practices 
operating income for the energy products segment decreased million  or for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the fourth quarter inventory charge of million related to changes in our warehousing and inventory carrying practices 
in addition  higher raw material costs and lower second and third quarter product shipments to large international oil and gas projects were offset by favorable foreign exchange rates of million and the mallard acquisition which added million of operating income 

table of contents interest expense  net interest expense  net decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the reduction in interest expense was primarily due to the million annual principal payments against our senior unsecured notes in october of and which reduced our outstanding balance 
other income  net other income  net decreased million from million for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the change was primarily attributable to a reduction of foreign currency exchange gains 
provision for taxes the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the same period last year 
the lower effective tax rate benefited from income tax benefits recorded in the fourth quarter of totaling million  which included tax credits for product development and research activities  the majority of which related to prior years and a reduction of our income tax liability for certain items 
the benefits recorded in the fourth quarter of coincided with the completion of the internal revenue service s examination of our us federal income tax returns for the two and one half months ended december   and the years ended december  and for  we expect an effective income tax rate of 
net income net income decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this net decrease is primarily attributable to the fourth quarter after tax charge for inventory of million related to changes in our warehousing and inventory carrying practices  increased corporate expenses to comply with the new requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of  and net higher metal costs for raw materials 
for  we expect revenues to be higher from due to a continued but gradual improvement in general industrial market conditions  plus the full year impact of the acquisitions of mallard in april and loud in january we expect our operating margins in to rise slightly in the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls product segment from  while operating margins in the energy products segment are expected to increase to approximately 
both product segments could be affected by increased competitive pricing and higher commodity metals costs for raw materials 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in  many of the general industrial end markets we serve were in a continuing slump 
however  the stronger foreign currencies such as the euro had a positive effect on our financial results as well as the full year impact of acquisitions  plus the continued success in fulfilling orders on large international oil and gas projects  particularly in the middle east 
the majority of our businesses that serve the general industrial markets concentrated in on trimming spending proportional to their declining customer order rates  reducing inventories  identifying opportunities to consolidate facilities  and developing new products and improving customer service levels to maintain and increase market share

revenues increased an incremental million from four acquisitions  tomco and us para plate in october plus dqs in november and texas sampling in december revenues also increased 
table of contents million resulting from the strengthened euro  translating the revenues of our european business units into higher us dollar amounts in revenues from general industrial instrumentation markets decreased million  primarily due to reduced sales volume caused by weak economic conditions in chemical processing  power generation  commercial aerospace  medical oem  and other general industrial instrumentation markets 
steam and hvac markets were also weak and contributed to lower sales by million 
energy products revenues increased by million  or  for the year ended december  the increase in revenues was the net result of several factors 
revenues increased million resulting from the strengthened euro and canadian dollar  translating the revenues of our italian and canadian business units into higher us dollar amounts in revenues also increased approximately million at our italian subsidiary  pibiviesse  as it was very successful winning and fulfilling orders for large international oil and gas projects  a majority of which were for customers in the middle east 
revenues decreased by million at our north american operations  principally due to reduced oil and gas drilling and production activity and the short cycle maintenance  repair and overhaul mro business in north america  and lower sales in from customer projects in the pacific rim and south american regions 
gross profit gross profit increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  gross margin decreased basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  gross profit for the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment increased million from and was the net result of several factors 
gross profit increased million from the incremental contribution of the four acquisitions  tomco  us para plate  dqs  and tsi 
gross profit also increased million from the foreign exchange effect of the stronger euro in gross profit also declined million which was the cumulative decrease from our ongoing business units in this segment 
this segment s gross margin decreased basis points to in due to the reduced sales volume at the ongoing business units  a shift in the mix of sales to lower margin products and fewer sales into higher margin commercial aerospace  medical oem  marine  power generation  and hvac markets  and increased unabsorbed manufacturing costs largely due to scaling back production in conjunction with the successful efforts to lower inventory levels 
this segment also nearly completed two facility closings in the fourth quarter of the tomco products operation was moved into our hoke us plant and the nearly complete move of the ssi equipment operation into the spence engineering plant was finalized in february these two facility consolidations incurred extra internal spending for training  re stocking and start up costs which were expensed 
additional factors that decreased gross profit were increased inventory obsolescence provision on specific product lines and severe pricing competition in certain product lines 
gross profit for the energy products segment increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the net gross profit increase was the net result of several factors 
gross profit increased million on s higher sales volume for large international oil and gas projects 
gross profit also increased million resulting from the strengthened euro and 
table of contents canadian dollar in gross profit decreased million in north america caused by lower product sales volume for higher margin maintenance and repair orders  competitive price reductions and higher insurance costs  partially offset by certain manufacturing and purchased inventory cost reductions 
gross margin in this segment increased basis points to in the gross margin improvement was due to increased international oil and gas project shipment volume and improved pricing in our overseas markets  and reduced costs of sale resulting from our foreign sourcing program 
these improvements to gross margin were partially offset by increased unabsorbed manufacturing costs resulting from decreased production volume that could not be avoided in our effort to reduce our inventory levels in our north american manufacturing operations 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses for the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment increased by million 
this net increase was the result of million in incremental expense from our four acquisitions  tomco  us para plate  dqs and tsi  a million increase due to changes in foreign exchange rates  and million increase from higher variable compensation costs  legal fees  and adjustments to the local statutory financial statements of two european subsidiaries 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the energy products segment increased million  net of a million increase from stronger foreign exchange rates changes offset by million lower expenses predominately in our north american operations which have been aggressively reducing their cost structures 
corporate general and administrative expenses decreased million in from the decrease in was the net result of lower fringe benefit and corporate development expenses partially offset by higher variable compensation and professional fees 
special charges special charges in totaled million compared to million in these charges were associated with the closure  consolidation and reorganization of certain of our north american manufacturing operations 
special charges were expensed in the periods incurred 
the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment had approximately million of special charges in and none in during the fourth quarter of  this segment closed its tomco manufacturing facility in painesville  ohio and consolidated its operation into our existing hoke manufacturing plant in spartanburg  south carolina 
also during the fourth quarter of  this segment nearly completed the consolidation of its ssi equipment operation from burlington  ontario  canada into its spence engineering plant in walden  new york 
the special charges related to this consolidation consisted of million of severance costs  for the employees that were affected  and million of exit costs 
the energy products segment recorded special charges of million in and million in its charges were for million of accrued severance for the announced transfer of the manufacturing capability at its kf industries canada operations affecting employees  and the resulting consolidation into a us plant  plus the approximately million write down to

its special charges consisted of approximately million of manufacturing equipment write offs  million of severance costs for employees and million of exit costs principally related to two north american leased facilities that were closed 
operating income the change in operating income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was as follows in thousands segment total change acquisitions operations foreign exchange instrumentation thermal fluid controls energy corporate total operating income for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million or from million for the year ended december  operating income for the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment decreased million  or  from this decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales of product into general industrial  aerospace  marine  medical oem  hvac  and power generation markets  a shift in the mix of sales to lower margin products  severe pricing competition in certain product lines  charges for two european subsidiaries to properly adjust their local statutory financial statements  increased inventory obsolescence provisions  a rise in legal  insurance and pension expense  charges to consolidate two facilities  and increased unabsorbed manufacturing costs 
increases to operating income came from incremental contributions from the acquisitions of tomco and us para plate  and the favorable effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes 
operating income for the energy products segment increased million  or  for the year ended december   primarily due to increased product shipments and pricing for large  international oil and gas projects in our overseas businesses  favorable effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes  and reduced costs of revenues resulting from the international sourcing program 
these gains were partially offset by lower north american manufacturing production volume resulting in unabsorbed manufacturing costs 
corporate spending in was lower by million compared to  primarily due to lower fringe benefit and corporate development expenses  which also contributed to the improved operating income 
interest expense  net interest expense  net decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily related to the lower outstanding balance of our senior unsecured notes in  reduced costs associated with the amendment of our unsecured revolving credit facility and the lower current year interest rates associated with our million of outstanding industrial revenue bonds 
interest income decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for this decrease 
table of contents is the result of lower average levels of cash on hand during the current year  due to fourth quarter acquisitions of tomco and us para plate and the fourth quarter acquisitions of dqs and tsi 
additionally  the year lower interest rate environment reduced the returns on invested cash 
provision for taxes the effective tax rate decreased percentage points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this rate reduction was the result of income tax benefits recorded in the fourth quarter of totaling million  which included tax credits for product development and research activities  the majority of which related to prior years and a reduction of our income tax liability for certain items

liquidity and capital resources our liquidity needs arise primarily from capital investment in machinery  equipment and the improvement of facilities  funding working capital requirements to support business growth initiatives  acquisitions  dividend payments  pension funding obligations and debt service costs 
we continue to generate cash from operations and remain in a strong financial position  with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses  strategic acquisitions and managing our capital structure on a short and long term basis 
the following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the periods indicated in thousands year ended december  cash flow provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash balances increase in cash and cash equivalents during the twelve months ended december   we generated million in cash flow from operating activities which was significantly lower than primarily due to a significant inventory 
table of contents reduction of million in compared to a use of cash in the million used by investing activities included million used for acquisitions  including mallard for million and million released from restricted escrow for prior year acquisitions  million used for the purchase of capital equipment offset by million of proceeds from the sales of the tomco products facility in ohio  the ssi facility in canada  and an energy products warehouse in houston  texas that had been held for sale 
we used million of cash in financing activities that included a net million payment of debt balances and another million used to pay dividends to shareholders offset by million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities as of december  was consistent with the ratio at december  cash and cash equivalents were million as of december  compared to million as of december  total debt as a percentage of total equity was as of december  compared to as of december as of december  we had million of investments designated as available for sale and readily convertible to cash should the need for additional working capital arise 
as of december  and december   we had million available under our unsecured revolving credit facility to support our acquisition program  working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes 
as of december  and december   we had no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
regarding investing activities  we paid million cash for all the stock of loud in january we used million of our cash and equivalents and borrowed million from our revolving credit facility that was repaid in february our budget for capital expenditures is approximately million and we expect to fund these capital expenditures from existing cash and by ongoing operations 
approximately million of that capital expenditure total is for new products  cost savings and equipment upgrades 
we estimate another million dollars to be used to purchase two new facilities  one in europe to co locate the consolidation of smaller instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products facilities  and a new plant in china  to replace the current  smaller suzhou kf valves facility operated by our energy products segment 
for the new plant in china  we expect to receive chinese government relocation benefits of approximately million to aid in the relocation of our current leased facility to a new  larger site 
apart from capital expenditures  we announced in december an agreement to purchase the ownership that we did not own in our chinese joint venture  suzhou kf valves 
in that agreement  we agreed to pay a total of million for this remaining interest and expect to pay this sum in three milestone payments during completion of this transaction is subject to the approval of chinese authorities and we expect that approval should be obtained by the end of the second quarter of certain of our loan agreements contain covenants that require  among other items  maintenance of certain financial ratios and also limit our ability to enter into secured and unsecured borrowing arrangements  issue dividends to shareholders  acquire and dispose of businesses  invest in capital equipment  participate in certain higher yielding long term investment vehicles  and issue additional shares of our stock 
we were in compliance with all covenants related to our existing debt obligations at december  and december  in october   and we made the first  second and third of our five million annual payments reducing the million original 
table of contents outstanding principal balance of our unsecured senior notes which mature in october the outstanding principal balance due on these senior notes was million as of december  we have generated net income and positive cash flow from operating activities since the company was formed in october over the next months  we expect to generate cash from operating activities that should be sufficient to service operations  capital expenditure needs  scheduled debt payments  and our current dividend practice of paying per share annually 
in addition  we have available cash balances and investments that are readily convertible to cash and available for use 
we continue to search for strategic acquisitions in the flow control market 
we expect that the financing of smaller sized acquisitions would come from existing cash and investments  and if need be  borrowings from our unused million revolving line of credit 
we expect a larger acquisition would require additional borrowings and  or  the issuance of our common stock

fasb statement r requires companies to recognize in the income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees  but expresses no preference for a type of valuation model 
the statement is effective for circor s interim and annual periods beginning after june  fasb r did not impact our financial position or results of operations as of december   however  our financial position and results of operations will be impacted in periods subsequent to june  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas amends apb  accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
fasb statement no 
is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in apb included certain exceptions to that principle 
sfas amends apb to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the adoption of this statement is not expected to impact our financial position or results of operations

the statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of this standard is not expected to impact our financial position or results of operations 
certain risk factors that may affect future results set forth below are certain risk factors that we believe are material to our stockholders 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations  and reputation could be harmed 
you should also consider these risk factors when you read forward looking statements elsewhere in this report 
you can identify forward looking statements by terms such as may  hope  should  expect  plan  anticipate  intend  believe  estimate  predict  potential  or continue  the negative of those terms or other comparable terminology 
those forward looking statements are only predictions and can be adversely affected if any of the following risks occur some of our end markets are cyclical  which may cause us to experience fluctuations in revenues or operating results 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  fluctuations in revenues and operating results due to economic and business cycles 
we sell our products principally to oil  gas  petrochemical  process  power  aerospace  military  heating  ventilation and air conditioning  or hvac  maritime  pharmaceutical  and medical and instrumentation markets 
although we serve a variety of markets to avoid a dependency on any one  a significant downturn in any one of these markets could cause a material reduction in our revenues that could be difficult to offset 
in particular  our petrochemical business is cyclical in nature as the worldwide demand for oil and gas fluctuates 
when worldwide demand for oil and gas is depressed  the demand for our products used in maintenance and repair of existing oil and gas applications  as well as exploration or new oil and gas project applications  is reduced 
as a result  we historically have generated lower revenues and profits in periods of declining demand for petrochemical products 
therefore  results of operations for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any future period 
future downturns in demand for petrochemical products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
similarly  although not to the same extent as the oil and gas markets  the aerospace  military and maritime markets have historically experienced cyclical fluctuations in demand that also could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we face the continuing impact on economic and financial conditions in the united states and around the world as well as current tensions in iraq and the rest of the middle east 
terrorist attacks have negatively impacted general economic  market and political conditions 
in particular  terrorist attacks  compounded with changes in the national economy  have resulted in reduced revenues in the aerospace and general industrial markets in years and although economic 
table of contents conditions appear to be improving  additional terrorist acts or acts of war wherever located around the world could cause damage or disruption to our business  our facilities  our joint venture partner or our employees which could significantly impact our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks  and other acts of war or hostility  including the current tensions in iraq and the middle east  have created many economic and political uncertainties  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot presently be predicted 
in addition  with manufacturing facilities located worldwide  including facilities located in the united states  canada  western europe and the people s republic of china  we may be impacted by terrorist actions not only against the united states but in other parts of the world as well 
we are not insured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war for our aviation products 
if we cannot continue operating our manufacturing facilities at current or higher levels  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we operate a number of manufacturing facilities for the production of our products 
the equipment and management systems necessary for such operations may break down  perform poorly  or fail  resulting in fluctuations in manufacturing efficiencies 
such fluctuations may affect our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we face significant competition in our markets and  if we are not able to respond to competition in our markets  our revenues may decrease 
we face significant competition from a variety of competitors in each of our markets 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  personnel and other resources than we do 
new competitors also could enter our markets 
we consider product quality  performance  price  distribution capabilities and breadth of product offerings to be the primary competitive factors in our markets 
our competitors may be able to offer more attractive pricing  duplicate our strategies  or develop enhancements to products that could offer performance features that are superior to our products 
competitive pressures  including those described above  and other factors could adversely affect our competitive position  involving a loss of market share or decreases in prices  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  some of our competitors are based in foreign countries and have cost structures and prices based on foreign currencies 
accordingly  currency fluctuations could cause our us dollar priced products to be less competitive than our competitors products that are priced in other currencies 
if we experience delays in introducing new products or if our existing or new products do not achieve or maintain market acceptance  our revenues may decrease 
our industries are characterized by intense competition  changes in end user requirements  technically complex products  and evolving product offerings and introductions 
we believe our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate or adapt to these factors and to offer  on a timely basis  products that meet customer demands 
failure to develop new and innovative products or to custom design existing products could result in the loss of existing customers to 
table of contents competitors or the inability to attract new business  either of which may adversely affect our revenues 
the development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring the anticipation of technological and market trends 
we may experience design  manufacturing  marketing or other difficulties  such as an inability to attract a sufficient number of qualified engineers  which could delay or prevent our development  introduction or marketing of new products or enhancements and result in unexpected expenses 
implementation of our acquisition strategy may not be successful  which could affect our ability to increase our revenues or could reduce our profitability 
one of our continued strategies is to increase our revenues and expand our markets through acquisitions that will provide us with complementary instrumentation and thermal fluid controls and petrochemical products 
we expect to spend significant time and effort in expanding our existing businesses and identifying  completing and integrating acquisitions 
we expect to face competition for acquisition candidates that may limit the number of acquisition opportunities available to us and may result in higher acquisition prices 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify  acquire or profitably manage additional companies or successfully integrate such additional companies without substantial costs  delays or other problems 
also  there can be no assurance that companies we acquire in the future will achieve revenues  profitability or cash flows that justify our investment in them 
in addition  acquisitions may involve a number of special risks  including adverse short term effects on our reported operating results  diversion of management s attention  loss of key personnel at acquired companies  or unanticipated management or operational problems or legal liabilities 
some or all of these special risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we fail to manufacture and deliver high quality products  we may lose customers 
product quality and performance are a priority for our customers since many of our product applications involve caustic or volatile chemicals and  in many cases  involve processes that require precise control of fluids 
our products also are used in the aerospace  military  commercial aircraft  pharmaceutical  medical  analytical equipment  oil and gas exploration  transmission and refining  chemical processing  and maritime industries 
these industries require products that meet stringent performance and safety standards 
if we fail to maintain and enforce quality control and testing procedures  our products will not meet these stringent performance and safety standards 
substandard products would seriously harm our reputation  resulting in both a loss of current customers to our competitors and damage to our ability to attract new customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we are unable to continue operating successfully overseas or to successfully expand into new international markets  our revenues may decrease 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the united states 
in addition  one of our key growth strategies is to market our products in international markets not currently served by us in portions of europe  latin america and asia 
we may not succeed in marketing  selling and distributing our products in these new markets 
moreover  conducting business outside the united states is subject to additional risks  including currency exchange rate fluctuations  changes in regional  political or economic 
table of contents conditions  trade protection measures such as tariffs or import or export restrictions  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
one or more of these factors could prevent us from successfully expanding into new international markets and could also have a material adverse effect on our current international operations 
if we can not pass on higher raw material or manufacturing costs to our customers  we may become less profitable 
one of the ways we attempt to manage the risk of higher raw material and manufacturing costs is to increase selling prices to our customers 
the markets we serve are extremely competitive and customers may not accept price increases or may look to alternative suppliers which may negatively impact our profitability and revenues 
if our suppliers can not provide us with adequate quantities of materials to meet our customers demands on a timely basis or if the quality of the materials provided does not meet our standards we may lose customers or experience lower profitability 
some of our customer contracts require us to compensate them if we do not meet specified delivery obligations 
we rely on numerous suppliers to provide us with our required materials and in many instances these materials must meet certain specifications 
during the second and third quarters of we experienced diminished supplier performance that negatively impacted our operating and net income 
the diminished supplier performance was the result of the sudden closure of one large european casting supplier  problems with new supplier on time delivery reliability as well as lower than expected new supplier qualification acceptance 
these items negatively impacted our operating and net income by approximately basis points in the second quarter of and to a lesser degree in the third quarter of we have taken steps to remediate these lower supplier performance issues and expect the diminished impact on profitability to be alleviated by the end of a continuation of these factors could have a negative impact on our ability to deliver our products to our customers within our committed time frames and could result in continued reductions of our operating and net income in future periods 
a change in international governmental policies or restrictions could result in decreased availability and increased costs for certain components and finished products that we outsource  which could adversely affect our profitability 
like most manufacturers of fluid control products  we attempt  where appropriate  to reduce costs by seeking lower cost sources of certain components and finished products 
many such sources are located in developing countries such as the people s republic of china  india and taiwan where a change in governmental approach toward us trade could restrict the availability to us of such sources 
in addition  periods of war or other international tension could interfere with international freight operations and hinder our ability to take delivery of such components and products 
a decrease in the availability of these items could hinder our ability to meet timely our customers orders 
we attempt  when possible  to mitigate this risk by maintaining alternate sources for these components and products and by maintaining the capability to produce such items in our own manufacturing facilities 
however  
table of contents even when we are able to mitigate this risk  the cost of obtaining such items from alternate sources or producing them ourselves is often considerably greater  and a shift toward such higher cost production could therefore adversely affect our profitability 
the costs of complying with existing or future environmental regulations  and of curing any violations of these regulations  could increase our expenses or reduce our profitability 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  use and disposal of chemicals  solid and hazardous waste and other toxic and hazardous materials used to manufacture  or resulting from the process of manufacturing  our products 
we cannot predict the nature  scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing or future laws will be administered or interpreted 
future regulations could be applied to materials  products or activities that have not been subject to regulation previously 
the costs of complying with new or more stringent regulations  or with more vigorous enforcement of these or existing regulations could be significant 
environmental laws require us to maintain and comply with a number of permits  authorizations and approvals and to maintain and update training programs and safety data regarding materials used in our processes 
violations of these requirements could result in financial penalties and other enforcement actions 
we also could be required to halt one or more portions of our operations until a violation is cured 
although we attempt to operate in compliance with these environmental laws  we may not succeed in this effort at all times 
the costs of curing violations or resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by government authorities could be substantial 
the costs of complying with existing or future governmental regulations on importing and exporting practices and of curing any violations of these regulations  could increase our expenses  reduce our revenues or reduce our profitability 
we are subject to a variety of laws and international trade practices including regulations issued by the united states bureau of customs and border protection  the bureau of export administration  the department of state  the department of treasury 
we cannot predict the nature  scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international trading practices might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 
future regulations could limit the countries into which certain of our products may be sold or could restrict our access to and increase the cost of obtaining products from foreign sources 
in addition  actual or alleged violations of such regulations could result in enforcement actions and or financial penalties that could result in substantial costs 
if our internal controls over financial reporting do not comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  our business and stock price could be adversely affected 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of each year beginning in  and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in all annual reports beginning with this annual report 
section also requires our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  and report on  management s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting 

table of contents although we intend to conduct a rigorous review of our internal controls over financial reporting to help achieve compliance with the section requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of  if our independent registered public accounting firm is not satisfied with our internal controls over financial reporting or with the level at which it is documented  designed  operated or reviewed  they may decline to attest to management s assessment or may issue a qualified report identifying either a significant deficiency or additional material weaknesses in our internal controls 
this could result in significant additional expenditures responding to the section internal control audit and a diversion of management attention 
in addition  if our internal controls over financial reporting are not considered adequate either by management in its self assessment or by our independent registered public accounting firm in their audit  we may experience a loss of public confidence  which could have an adverse effect on our business and our stock price 
we face risks from product liability lawsuits that may adversely affect our business 
we  like other manufacturers and distributors of products designed to control and regulate fluids and chemicals  face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury  property damage or business interruption to our customers 
we may be subjected to various product liability claims  including  among others  that our products include inadequate or improper instructions for use or installation  or inadequate warnings concerning the effects of the failure of our products 
although we maintain strict quality controls and procedures  including the testing of raw materials and safety testing of selected finished products  we cannot be certain that our products will be completely free from defect 
in addition  in certain cases  we rely on third party manufacturers for our products or components of our products 
although we have liability insurance coverage  we cannot be certain that this insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost  or  if available  will be adequate to cover any such liabilities 
we generally seek to obtain contractual indemnification from our third party suppliers  and for us to be added as an additional insured party under such parties insurance policies 
any such indemnification or insurance is limited by its terms and  as a practical matter  is limited to the credit worthiness of the indemnifying or insuring party 
in the event that we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification  product liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the costs associated with the defense of asbestos related claims and the payment of any judgments or settlements with respect to such claims are subject to a number of uncertainties 
as such  we cannot guarantee that such claims ultimately will not have an adverse effect on our financial statements  results of operations or cash flows 
like many other manufacturers of fluid control products  we have been named as defendants in a growing number of product liability actions brought on behalf of individuals who seek compensation for their alleged exposure to airborne asbestos fibers 
in general  any components containing asbestos formerly used in our products were entirely internal to the product and  we believe  would not give rise to ambient asbestos dust during normal operation or during normal inspection and maintenance 
as such  we have no basis on which to conclude that these cases will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flow 
however  due to the nature and number of variables associated with asbestos related claims  such as the rate at which new claims may be filed  the 
table of contents availability of insurance policies to continue to recover certain of our costs relating to the defense and payment of these claims  the impact of bankruptcies of other companies currently or historically defending asbestos claims  the uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards  the type and severity of the disease alleged to be suffered by each claimant  and increases in the expense of medical treatment  we are unable to reliably estimate the ultimate costs of these claims 
we depend on our key personnel and the loss of their services may adversely affect our business 
we believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of our senior management team and other key personnel 
if one or more members of our senior management team or other key personnel were unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions  our business could be seriously harmed 
in addition  if any of our key personnel joins a competitor or forms a competing company  some of our customers might choose to use the services of that competitor or those of a new company instead of our own 
other companies seeking to develop capabilities and products similar to ours may hire away some of our key personnel 
nonetheless  if we are unable to maintain our key personnel and attract new employees  the execution of our business strategy may be hindered and our growth limited 
various restrictions and agreements could hinder a takeover of us which is not supported by our board of directors or which is leveraged 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by laws  the delaware general corporation law and our shareholder rights plan contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control in a transaction that is not approved by our board of directors or that is on a leveraged basis or otherwise 
these include provisions creating a staggered board  limiting the shareholders powers to remove directors  and prohibiting shareholders from calling a special meeting or taking action by written consent in lieu of a shareholders meeting 
in addition  our board of directors has the authority  without further action by the shareholders  to set the terms of and to issue preferred stock 
issuing preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the owners of our common stock  including the loss of voting control to others 
additionally  we have adopted a shareholder rights plan providing for the issuance of rights that will cause substantial dilution to a person or group of persons that acquires or more of our shares of common stock  unless the rights are redeemed 
delaying or preventing a takeover could result in our shareholders ultimately receiving less for their shares by deterring potential bidders for our stock or assets 
our debt agreements limit our ability to issue equity  make acquisitions  incur debt  pay dividends  make investments  sell assets  merge or raise capital 
our senior note purchase agreement  dated october   and our revolving credit facility agreement  dated october   and most recently amended and effective on january   govern our indebtedness to our lenders 
the debt agreements include provisions which place limitations on certain activities including our ability to issue shares of our common stock  incur additional indebtedness  create any liens or encumbrances on our assets or make any guarantees  make certain investments  pay cash dividends above certain limits  or dispose of or sell assets or enter into a merger or a similar transaction 

table of contents the trading price of our common stock may be volatile and investors in our common stock may experience substantial losses 
the trading price of our common stock may be volatile 
our common stock could decline or fluctuate in response to a variety of factors  including  but not limited to our failure to meet the performance estimates of securities analysts  changes in financial estimates of our revenues and operating results or buy sell recommendations by securities analysts  the timing of announcements by us or our competitors concerning significant product line developments  contracts or acquisitions or publicity regarding actual or potential results or performance  fluctuation in our quarterly operating results caused by fluctuations in revenue and expenses  substantial sales of our common stock by our existing shareholders  general stock market conditions  or other economic or external factors 
in addition  the stock market as a whole has in the past experienced price and volume fluctuations 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources 
our international activities expose us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
our international manufacturing and sales activities expose us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
such fluctuations could result in our i paying higher prices for certain imported goods and services  ii realizing lower prices for any sales denominated in currencies other than us dollars  iii realizing lower net income  on a us dollar basis  from our international operations due to the effects of translation from weakened functional currencies  and iv realizing higher costs to settle transactions denominated in other currencies 
any of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
our major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in western europe  canada and asia 
we use forward contracts to manage the currency risk related to business transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
we primarily utilize forward exchange contracts with maturities of less than eighteen months 
to the extent these transactions are completed  the contracts do not subject us to significant risk from exchange rate fluctuations because they offset gains and losses on the related foreign currency denominated transactions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the oil and gas markets historically have been subject to cyclicality depending upon supply and demand for crude oil  its derivatives and natural gas 
when oil or gas prices decrease expenditures on maintenance and repair decline rapidly and outlays for exploration and in field drilling projects decrease and  accordingly  demand for valve products is reduced 
however  when oil and gas prices rise  maintenance and repair activity and spending for facilities projects normally increase and we benefit from increased demand for valve products 
however  oil or gas price increases may be considered temporary in nature or not driven by customer demand and  therefore  may result in longer lead times for increases in petrochemical sales orders 
as a result  the timing and magnitude of changes in market 
table of contents demand for oil and gas valve products are difficult to predict 
similarly  although not to the same extent as the oil and gas markets  the general industrial  chemical processing  aerospace  military and maritime markets have historically experienced cyclical fluctuations in demand that also could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
interest rate sensitivity risk as of december   our primary interest rate risk is related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our industrial revenue bonds 
the interest rates for our revolving credit facility and industrial revenue bonds fluctuate with changes in short term borrowing rates 
there were no borrowings under our revolving credit facility outstanding as of december  based upon expected levels of borrowings under our credit facility in and our current balances for industrial revenue bonds  an increase in variable interest rates of basis points would not have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange risk we use forward contracts to manage the currency risk related to certain business transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
related gains and losses are recognized when the contracts expire  which are generally in the same period as the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions 
to the extent these transactions are completed  the contracts do not subject us to significant risk from exchange rate movements because they offset gains and losses on the related foreign currency denominated transactions 
as of december   we had million of forward contracts to buy foreign currencies 
there were no unrealized gains attributable to foreign currency forward contracts at december  and the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions 
our risk of loss in the event of non performance by the counterparties is not significant 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
risk management strategies are reviewed and approved by senior management before implementation 
supplier and customer price risk the primary raw materials used in our production processes are stainless steel  carbon steel  cast iron and brass 
we purchase these materials from numerous suppliers nationally and internationally  and we have not historically experienced significant difficulties in obtaining these commodities in quantities sufficient for our operations 
however  these commodities are subject to price fluctuations that affect our results of operations 
we manage this risk by offsetting increases in commodity prices with increased customer sales prices  active materials management  product engineering programs and through the diversity of materials used in our production process 
during we experienced rising raw material prices that negatively impacted our second quarter margins by approximately and basis points in the instrumentation and thermal fluid control products and energy products segments  respectively 
during the second and third quarters of we increased our selling prices in many of our product lines which has helped to offset the continually rising raw material prices and mitigated the negative impact on our third quarter margins by approximately basis points 
however  if we are unable to fully offset previous and any future escalations of our raw material costs our operating and net income would be negatively impacted in future periods
