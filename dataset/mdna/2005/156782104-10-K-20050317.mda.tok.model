the strong growth in managed services bookings contributed to a decline in hardware bookings and hardware revenue in as clients electing managed services do not need to make the upfront hardware purchase that they would make in a transaction that does not include managed services 
as a result  hardware revenue declined in compared to licensed software revenue grew at a strong rate of in  but this growth was partially offset by the decline in hardware revenue  resulting in lower system sales growth of for despite the near term impact on system sales  the company views this mix shift favorably because the higher level of managed services bookings improves the visibility of future revenue streams

excluding these two items  net earnings would have been  higher  or  the increase in net earnings was driven by revenue growth and margin expansion

in  the company generated  of cash flow from operations  compared to  in free cash flow  defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software  was  in compared to  in healthcare information technology market the company believes the market for healthcare information technology remains strong 
the healthcare information technology industry  and cerner specifically  continues to benefit from the focus healthcare providers have placed on using technology to drive major patient safety and quality initiatives into their organizations with the ultimate goal of becoming completely digital or paperless 
in addition  the company continues to benefit from its clients increased desire to have a common architecture spanning clinical  management and financial solutions 
in many ways  the company believes was a defining year for the healthcare information technology industry 
president bush began the year by proclaiming in his state of the union address that we can avoid dangerous medical mistakes  reduce costs and improve care by computerizing health records 
the president also established a goal for every american to have a personal health record within the next years  and he reaffirmed that goal in his state of the union address 
in the spring of  the president created a sub cabinet position at the department of health and human services hhs to spearhead this effort 
in the summer of  senator hillary clinton and majority leader bill frist took to the pages of the washington post to opine in bipartisan fashion that information technology is central to solving the healthcare crisis 
and as the democratic and republican parties laid out their agendas in january of for the th congress  both signaled a strong commitment to healthcare information technology 
finally  saw more widespread adoption of pay for performance compensation systems for both hospitals and physician offices 
employers such as general motors  delta airlines  ups  verizon  general electric  and boeing led the way both at the company level and through the leapfrog group s standards 
and in february of  the center for medicare and medicaid services cms announced the first ever medicare pay for performance initiative for doctors 
in summary  was an exciting year of increased focus on healthcare information technology 
although no assurances can be provided  management believes  and recent events suggest  that this momentum could continue

the decrease in net earnings is due primarily to a higher increase in expenses than revenue compared to the prior year 
as discussed above  revenue increased less than the company expected because of the decrease in new contract bookings in the first quarter of and the shift in bookings mix to more managed services and subscription bookings which are recognized as revenue over longer periods of time 
the increase in expenses was driven primarily by continued investments in the company s development of software and by sales and client services expenses

the company completed its transitional review of the company s goodwill values in the second quarter of as a result of this review  the company determined that goodwill arising from the acquisition of mitch cooper and associates was impaired due to declining demand and margins in this business 
mitch cooper and associates was a supply chain re engineering consulting practice 
the impairment charge to reflect this goodwill at fair value was  net of tax  and is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of the beginning of the company used a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting units 
liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity is influenced by many factors  including the amount and timing of the company s revenues  its cash collections from its clients and the amounts the company invests in software development  acquisitions and capital expenditures 
the company s principal source of liquidity is its cash and cash equivalents

the new standard is effective in the first interim period beginning after june  the company is currently assessing the impact that the statement may have on its consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the company believes that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding the company s historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amount of revenue and other significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
these significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  software development  concentrations  allowance for doubtful accounts and potential impairments of goodwill 
these policies and the company s procedures related to these policies are described in detail below and under specific areas within this management discussion and analysis or financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  note to the consolidated financial statements expands upon discussion of the company s accounting policies 
revenue recognition the company recognizes its multiple element arrangements  including software and software related services  using the residual method under sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 sop and clarified by staff accounting bulletin s sab revenue recognition in financial statements and sab no 
revenue recognition and emerging issues task force accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
key factors in the company s revenue recognition model are management s assessments that installation services are essential to the functionality of the company s software whereas implementation services are not 
if the company s business model were to change such that implementation services became essential to the functionality of the company s software  the period of time over which the company s licensed software revenue were to be recognized would lengthen 
the company generally recognizes revenue from the sale of its licensed software over two key milestones  delivery and installation  based on percentages that reflect the underlying effort from planning to installation 
additionally  if the time to achieve the company s delivery and installation milestones for its licensed software were to be accelerated or decelerated  its milestones would be adjusted and the timing of revenue recognition for its licensed software could materially change 

table of contents software development costs costs incurred internally in creating computer software solutions are expensed until technological feasibility has been established upon completion of a detailed program design 
thereafter  all software development costs are capitalized and subsequently reported at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable value 
capitalized costs are amortized based on current and expected future revenue for each software solution with minimum annual amortization equal to the straight line amortization over the estimated economic life of the software solution 
the company is amortizing capitalized costs over five years 
the company expects that major software information systems companies  large information technology consulting service providers and systems integrators and others specializing in the healthcare industry may offer competitive products or services 
the pace of change in the healthcare information systems market is rapid and there are frequent new product introductions  product enhancements and evolving industry standards and requirements 
as a result  the capitalized software solutions may become less valuable or obsolete and could be subject to impairment 
concentrations substantially all of the company s cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  are held at three major us financial institutions 
the majority of the company s cash equivalents consist of us government federal agency securities  short term marketable securities and overnight repurchase agreements 
deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits 
generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and  therefore  bear minimal risk 
substantially all of the company s clients are integrated delivery networks  hospitals and other healthcare related organizations 
if significant adverse macro economic factors were to impact these organizations it could materially adversely affect the company 
the company s access to certain software and hardware components is dependent upon single and sole source suppliers 
the inability of any supplier to fulfill supply requirements of the company could affect future results 
allowance for doubtful accounts if the creditworthiness of the company s clients were to weaken or the company s collections results relative to historical experience were to decline  it could have a material adverse impact on operations and cash flows 
goodwill the company accounts for its goodwill under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever there is an impairment indicator 
all goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit  where it is subject to an impairment test based on fair value 
the company completed its transitional review of the company s goodwill values in the second quarter of as a result of this review  the company determined that goodwill arising from the acquisition of mitch cooper and associates was impaired due to declining demand and margins in this business 
mitch cooper and associates was a supply chain re engineering consulting practice 
the impairment charge to reflect this goodwill at fair value was  net of tax  and is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of the beginning of the company again assessed its goodwill for impairment in the second quarters of and and concluded that no goodwill was impaired 
the company used a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting units for all periods 
the company completed five acquisitions and one divestiture subsequent to june   which resulted in approximately million of goodwill that was not amortized in accordance with sfas goodwill amounted to  and  at january  and january   respectively 
if future  anticipated cash flows from the company s reporting units  that recognized goodwill  do not materialize as expected the company s goodwill could be impaired  which would result in significant write offs 

table of contents factors that may affect future results of operations  financial condition or business statements made in this report  the annual report to shareholders in which this report is made a part  other reports and proxy statements filed with the securities and exchange commission  communications to shareholders  press releases and oral statements made by representatives of the company that are not historical in nature  or that state the company s or management s intentions  hopes  beliefs  expectations or predictions of the future  may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities and exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
forward looking statements can often be identified by the use of forward looking terminology  such as could  should  will  intended  continue  believe  may  expect  hope  anticipate  goal  forecast  plan  guidance or estimate or the negative of these words  variations thereof or similar expressions 
forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results 
they involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
it is important to note that any such performance and actual results  financial condition or business  could differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere herein or in other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
other unforeseen factors not identified herein could also have such an effect 
the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements to reflect changed assumptions  the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes in future operating results  financial condition or business over time 
quarterly operating results may vary the company s quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may continue to vary in future periods  including  variations from guidance  expectations or historical results or trends 
quarterly operating results may vary for a number of reasons including accounting policy changes mandated by regulating entities  demand for the company s software solutions and services  the company s long sales cycle  potentially long installation and implementation cycles for these larger  more complex and costlier systems and other factors described in this section and elsewhere in this report 
as a result of healthcare industry trends and the market for the company s cerner millennium solutions  a large percentage of the company s revenues are generated by the sale and installation of larger  more complex and costlier systems 
the sales process for these systems is lengthy and involves a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources by the client 
sales may be subject to delays due to changes in clients internal budgets  procedures for approving large capital expenditures  competing needs for other capital expenditures  availability of personnel resources and by actions undertaken by competitors 
delays in the expected sale or installation of these large contracts may have a significant impact on the company s anticipated quarterly revenues and consequently its earnings  since a significant percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed 
the company recognizes revenue upon the completion of standard milestone conditions and the amount of revenue recognized in any quarter depends upon the company s and the client s ability to meet these project milestones 
delays in meeting these milestone conditions or modification of the contract relating to one or more of these systems could result in a shift of revenue recognition from one quarter to another and could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for a particular quarter 
the company s revenues from system sales historically have been lower in the first quarter of the year and greater in the fourth quarter of the year  primarily as a result of the clients year end efforts to make all final capital expenditures for the then current year 
stock price may be volatile the trading price of the company s common stock may be volatile 
the market for the company s common stock may experience significant price and volume fluctuations in response to a number of factors including actual or anticipated quarterly variations in operating results  rumors about the company s performance or software solutions  changes in expectations of future financial performance or changes in estimates of securities analysts  governmental regulatory action  healthcare reform measures  client relationship developments  changes occurring in the securities markets in general and other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
as a matter of policy  the company does not generally comment on rumors 

table of contents furthermore  the stock market in general  and the market for software and healthcare and information technology companies in particular  has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of the company s common stock  regardless of actual operating performance 
changes in the healthcare industry the healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences 
for example  the balanced budget act of public law contained significant changes to medicare and medicaid and had an impact for several years on healthcare providers ability to invest in capital intensive systems 
in addition  the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa is having a direct impact on the healthcare industry by requiring identifiers and standardized transactions code sets and necessary security and privacy measures in order to ensure the protection of patient health information 
these factors affect the purchasing practices and operation of healthcare organizations 
federal and state legislatures have periodically considered programs to reform or amend the us healthcare system at both the federal and state level and to change healthcare financing and reimbursement systems 
these programs may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates or otherwise change the environment in which healthcare industry participants operate 
healthcare industry participants may respond by reducing their investments or postponing investment decisions  including investments in the company s software solutions and services 
many healthcare providers are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power 
these providers may try to use their market power to negotiate price reductions for the company s software solutions and services 
as the healthcare industry consolidates  the company s client base could be eroded  competition for clients could become more intense and the importance of acquiring each client becomes greater 
significant competition the market for healthcare information systems is intensely competitive  rapidly evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors in this market include the breadth and quality of system and software solution offerings  the stability of the information systems provider  the features and capabilities of the information systems  the ongoing support for the system and the potential for enhancements and future compatible software solutions 
certain of the company s competitors have greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources than the company and some of its competitors offer software solutions that it does not offer 
the company s principal existing competitors include  eclipsys corporation  epic systems corporation  ge medical systems  idx systems corporation  isoft corporation  mckesson corporation  medical information technology  inc meditech  misys healthcare systems and siemens medical solutions health services corporation  each of which offers a suite of software solutions that compete with many of the company s software solutions and services 
there are other competitors that offer a more limited number of competing software solutions 
in addition  the company expects that major software information systems companies  large information technology consulting service providers and system integrators  internet based start up companies and others specializing in the healthcare industry may offer competitive software solutions or services 
the pace of change in the healthcare information systems market is rapid and there are frequent new software solution introductions  software solution enhancements and evolving industry standards and requirements 
as a result  the company s success will depend upon its ability to keep pace with technological change and to introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new and enhanced software solutions and services that satisfy changing client requirements and achieve market acceptance 
proprietary technology may be subjected to infringement claims or may be infringed upon the company relies upon a combination of license agreements  confidentiality procedures  employee nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to maintain the confidentiality and trade secrecy of its proprietary information 
the company also relies on trademark and copyright laws to protect its intellectual property 
the company has initiated a patent program but currently has a limited patent 
table of contents portfolio 
as a result  the company may not be able to protect against misappropriation of its intellectual property 
in addition  the company could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of its software solutions and services expands 
these claims  even if not meritorious  could be expensive to defend 
if the company becomes liable to third parties for infringing their intellectual property rights  it could be required to pay a substantial damage award and to develop noninfringing technology  obtain a license or cease selling the software solutions that contain the infringing intellectual property 
government regulation the healthcare industry is highly regulated at the local  state and federal level 
consequently  the company may be subject to such regulations  which include regulation in the areas of healthcare fraud  medical devices and the security and privacy of patient data  and the risk of changes in the various local  state and federal laws 
healthcare fraud 
the federal government continues to strengthen its position and scrutiny over practices involving healthcare fraud affecting healthcare providers whose services are reimbursed by medicare  medicaid and other government healthcare programs 
healthcare providers who are clients of the company are subject to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which  among other things  prohibit the direct or indirect payment or receipt of any remuneration for patient referrals  or arranging for or recommending referrals or other business paid for in whole or in part by these federal or state healthcare programs 
legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantial funding  powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse 
the effect of this government regulation of the company s clients is difficult to predict 
while the company believes that it is in substantial compliance with any applicable laws  many of the regulations applicable to the company s clients and that may be applicable to the company  are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts 
they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial  regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require the company s clients to make changes in their operations or the way that they deal with the company 
if the such laws and regulations are determined to be applicable to the company and if the company fails to comply with any applicable laws and regulations  it could be subject to sanctions or liability  including exclusion from government health programs and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
regulation of medical devices 
the united states food and drug administration the fda has declared that certain of the company s software solutions are medical devices that are actively regulated under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act act and amendments to the act 
as a consequence  the company is subject to extensive regulation by the fda with regard to those software solutions that are actively regulated 
if other of the company s software solutions are deemed to be actively regulated medical devices by the fda  the company could be subject to extensive requirements governing pre and post marketing requirements including pre market notification clearance prior to marketing 
complying with these fda regulations would be time consuming and expensive 
it is possible that the fda may become more active in regulating computer software that is used in healthcare 
there have been six fda inspections since at various cerner sites 
inspections conducted at the company s world headquarters in and its houston facility in each resulted in the issuance of an fda form that the company responded to promptly 
the fda has taken no further action with respect to either of the form s that were issued in and the remaining four fda inspections  including an inspection at the company s world headquarters in  resulted in no issuance of a form the company  however  remains subject to periodic fda inspections and there can be no assurances that the company will not be required to undertake additional actions to comply with the act and any other applicable regulatory requirements 
any failure by the company to comply with the act and any other applicable regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to continue to manufacture and distribute its software solutions 
the fda has many enforcement tools including recalls  seizures  injunctions  civil fines and or criminal prosecutions 
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents security and privacy of patient information 
state and federal laws regulate the confidentiality of patient records and the circumstances under which those records may be released 
these regulations govern both the disclosure and use of confidential patient medical record information and require the users of such information to implement specified security measures 
regulations currently in place governing electronic health data transmissions continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa requires national standards for some types of electronic health information transactions and the data elements used in those transactions  security standards to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of health information and standards to protect the privacy of individually identifiable health information 
covered entities under hipaa  which include healthcare organizations such as the company s clients  were required to comply with the privacy standards by april and additional transaction regulations by october such organizations must also be in compliance with security regulations by april as a business associate of the covered entities  the company  in most instances  must also ensure compliance with the hipaa regulations 
the effect of hipaa on the company s business is difficult to predict  and there can be no assurances that the company will adequately address the business risks created by hipaa and its implementation  or that the company will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities 
furthermore  the company is unable to predict what changes to hipaa  or the regulations issued pursuant to hipaa  might be made in the future or how those changes could affect the company s business or the costs of compliance with hipaa 
evolving hipaa related laws or regulations could restrict the ability of the company s clients to obtain  use or disseminate patient information 
this could adversely affect demand for the company s solutions if they are not re designed in a timely manner in order to meet the requirements of any new regulations that seek to protect the privacy and security of patient data or enable the company s clients to execute new or modified healthcare transactions 
the company may need to expend additional capital  research and development and other resources to modify its solutions to address these evolving data security and privacy issues 
product related liabilities many of the company s software solutions provide data for use by healthcare providers in providing care to patients 
although no such claims have been brought against the company to date regarding injuries related to the use of its software solutions  such claims may be made in the future 
although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage in an amount that it believes is sufficient for its business  there can be no assurance that such coverage will cover a particular claim that may be brought in the future  prove to be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful claim brought against the company  which is uninsured  or under insured could materially harm its business  results of operations or financial condition 
system errors and warranties the company s systems  particularly the cerner millennium versions  are very complex 
as with complex systems offered by others  the company s systems may contain errors  especially when first introduced 
although the company conducts extensive testing  it has discovered software errors in its software solutions after their introduction 
the company s systems are intended for use in collecting and displaying clinical information used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients 
therefore  users of the company software solutions have a greater sensitivity to system errors than the market for software products generally 
the company s agreements with its clients typically provide warranties against material errors and other matters 
failure of a client s system to meet these criteria could constitute a material breach under such contracts allowing the client to cancel the contract and obtain a refund and or damages  or could require the company to incur additional expense in order to make the system meet these criteria 
the company s contracts with its clients generally limit the company s liability arising from such claims but such limits may not be enforceable in certain jurisdictions or circumstances 
a successful claim brought against the company  which is uninsured  or under insured could materially harm its business  results of operations or financial condition 
risks associated with the company s global operations the company markets  sells and services its software solutions globally 
the company has established offices around the world  including in the americas  europe  in the middle east and in the asia pacific region 
the company will continue to 
table of contents expand its global operations and enter new global markets 
this expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources to develop successful direct and indirect global sales and support channels 
the business transacted is in the local functional currency and the company does not currently have any material exposure to foreign currency transaction gains or losses 
all other business transactions are in us dollars 
to date  the company has not entered into any derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk 
in some countries  the company s success will depend in part on its ability to form relationships with local partners 
there is a risk that the company may sometimes choose the wrong partner 
for these reasons  the company may not be able to maintain or increase global market demand for its software solutions 
global operations are subject to inherent risks  and the company s future results could be adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors 
these include greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing global operations  the impact of economic conditions outside the united states  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  certification or regulatory requirements  reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries  potentially adverse tax consequences  different or additional functionality requirements  trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements  service provider and government spending patterns  natural disasters  war or terrorist acts  poor selection of a partner in a country  and political conditions which may impact sales or threaten the safety of associates or the continued presence of the company in these countries 
recruitment and retention of key personnel to remain competitive in the healthcare information technology industry  the company must attract  motivate and retain highly skilled managerial  sales  marketing  consulting and technical personnel  including executives  consultants  programmers and systems architects skilled in the healthcare information technology industry and the technical environments in which the company s solutions operate 
competition for such personnel in this industry is intense 
the company s failure to attract additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s prospects for long term growth 
the success of the company is dependent to a significant degree on the continued contributions of key management  sales  marketing  consulting and technical personnel 
the company has succession plans in place  however  the unexpected loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact to the company s business and results of operations  and could potentially inhibit solution development and market share advances 
third party suppliers the company licenses or purchases intellectual property and technology such as software  hardware and content from third parties  including some competitors  and incorporates it into or sells it in conjunction with the company s software solutions and services  some of which intellectual property or technology is critical to the operation of the company s solutions 
if any of the third party suppliers were to change product offerings  increase prices or terminate the company s licenses or supply contracts  the company might need to seek alternative suppliers and incur additional internal or external development costs to ensure continued performance of the company s solutions 
such alternatives may not be available on attractive terms  or may not be as widely accepted or as effective as the intellectual property or technology provided by the company s existing suppliers 
if the cost of licensing  purchasing or maintaining these third party intellectual property or technology solutions significantly increases  the company s gross margin levels could significantly decrease 
in addition  interruption in functionality of the company s solutions could adversely affect future sales of licenses and services 
sales forecasts the company s sales forecasts may vary from actual sales in a particular quarter 
the company uses a pipeline system  a common industry practice  to forecast sales and trends in its business 
the company s sales associates monitor the status of all sales opportunities  such as the date 
table of contents when they estimate that a client will make a purchase decision and the potential dollar amount of the sale 
these estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline 
the company compares this pipeline at various points in time to evaluate trends in its business 
this analysis provides guidance in business planning and forecasting  but these pipeline estimates are by their nature speculative 
the company s pipeline estimates are not necessarily reliable predictors of revenues in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time  partially because of changes in the pipeline and in conversion rates of the pipeline into contracts that can be very difficult to estimate 
a variation in the expected conversion rate or timing of the pipeline into contracts  or in the pipeline itself  could cause the company s plan or forecast to be inaccurate and thereby adversely affect business results 
for example  a slowdown in information technology spending  or economic conditions or a variety of other reasons can cause purchasing decisions to be delayed  reduced in amount or cancelled  which would reduce the overall pipeline conversion rate in a particular period of time 
because a substantial portion of the company s contracts are completed in the latter part of a quarter  the company may not be able to adjust its cost structure promptly in response to a revenue shortfall resulting from a decrease in its pipeline conversion rate in any given fiscal quarter s
