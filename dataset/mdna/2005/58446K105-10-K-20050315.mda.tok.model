item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reference is made to the risk factors below for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations and any of our forward looking statements contained herein 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended december   and overview in  we completed our planned network upgrade program that significantly increased bandwidth and enabled interactivity 
as of december   approximately of our cable network was upgraded with mhz to mhz bandwidth capacity and about of our estimated homes passed were activated with two way communications capability 
as of the same date  approximately of our basic subscribers were served by our largest headend facilities 
expressed in megahertz  or mhz  bandwidth represents a system s capacity to deliver telecommunication services 
a headend facility is the location where signals are received and processed for distribution over a cable system to our customers 
our network technology allows us to offer an array of advanced video  data and voice products and services  including vod  dvrs  hdtv  hsd and  beginning in the second quarter of  cable telephony 
we currently offer video and hsd bundles  and when we introduce cable telephony  we will offer triple play bundles of video  hsd and voice 
bundled products and services offer our subscribers a single provider contact for provisioning  billing and customer care 
we face increasing competition for our video programming services  most notably from dbs service providers 
since they have been permitted to deliver local television broadcast signals beginning in  directv  inc and echostar communications corporation  the two largest dbs service providers  have been increasing the number of markets in which they deliver these local television signals 
as of december   local to local launches in our markets represented an estimated of our basic subscribers 
during  competitive pressure from dbs service providers further intensified when they launched local television channels in additional markets representing an estimated of our basic subscriber base 
these local into local launches were usually accompanied by heavy marketing and advertising and are the primary cause of our loss of basic subscribers during the last two years 
in september  as a result of hurricane ivan  our cable systems in areas of alabama  florida and mississippi experienced  to varying degrees  damage to cable plant and other property and equipment  business interruption and loss of customers 
this hurricane caused a temporary loss of an estimated  basic subscribers   digital customers and  data customers in these three states 
while we believe many of these customers will return to our service  there can be no assurance that they will do so 
the revenue impact and the costs incurred are reflected in our consolidated financial statements  and are detailed as follows revenues were recorded net of million of service interruption credits issued to customers  service costs included million of incremental costs to cover the repair of our facilities  the use of outside contractors to help repair cable plant and increased employee costs  selling  general and administrative expenses included incremental costs of million related to additional customer service employee costs required to support customers needs  and depreciation expense included million due to an impairment of cable plant and other property and equipment 
in addition  we incurred capital expenditures of approximately million to replace or rebuild property  plant and equipment damaged by hurricane ivan 
we are insured against certain losses related to the hurricane  subject to varying deductible amounts 
at this time  we cannot estimate the amounts that will be ultimately recoverable under our insurance policies 

table of contents actual results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table sets forth the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands and percentage changes that are not meaningful are marked nm year ended december  change change revenues costs and expenses service costs selling  general and administrative expenses corporate expenses depreciation and amortization operating income interest expense  net gain on derivatives  net    nm gain loss on sale of assets and investments  net    nm other expense net income loss before provision for income taxes    nm provision for income taxes net income loss    nm revenues the following table sets forth revenue information for the years ended december  and dollars in millions year ended december  of of amount revenues amount revenues change change video data advertising video revenues represent monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our core cable television products and services including basic  expanded basic and analog premium programming  digital cable television programming services  wire maintenance  equipment rental and services to commercial establishments  pay per view charges  installation and reconnection fees  late payment fees  and other ancillary revenues 
data revenues primarily represent monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our data products and services and equipment rental fee 
franchise fees charged to customers for payment to local franchising authorities are included in their corresponding revenue category 
revenues rose  net of service interruption credits given to customers affected by the hurricane 
excluding such credits  revenues rose  largely attributable to an increase in broadband data customers and basic rate increases applied on our video customers  driven in large part by our own video programming cost increases  offset by a reduction in basic subscribers during the period 

table of contents video revenues rose as a result of the aforementioned basic rate increases  substantially offset by a loss of basic subscribers from  to  digital customers increased to  as compared to  a year ago 
our loss in basic subscribers resulted primarily from increased competitive pressures by dbs service providers  particularly in those markets where we experienced their local into local launches and  to a lesser extent  from our tighter customer credit policies 
in an effort to reverse this video subscriber trend  we have been increasing our customer retention efforts and our emphasis on product bundling  enhancing and differentiating our video products and services with new digital packages  vod  hdtv  dvr and more local programming 
data revenues rose  due primarily to a increase in data customers from  to  and an increased contribution from our relatively new commercial enterprise business 
advertising revenues increased  primarily as a result of higher local advertising sales  including political advertising and  to a lesser extent  the completion of an interconnect in one of our larger markets 
political advertising contributed approximately of this increase 
also in  we completed an interconnect agreement  under which we represent other cable operators to jointly sell local advertising  which accounted for of the growth 
we do not expect growth in advertising revenues to continue at the same rate in  due to the likely reduction in political advertising and because we do not currently expect to enter into any new material interconnect agreements 
costs and expenses service costs include fees paid to programming suppliers  expenses related to wages and salaries of technical personnel who maintain our cable network and perform customer installation activities  broadband data access costs  including costs of bandwidth connectivity  customer provisioning and technical support and plant operating costs  such as utilities and pole rental expense 
programming costs  which are payments to programmers for content and are generally paid on a per subscriber basis  have historically increased due to both increases in the rates charged for existing programming services and the introduction of new programming services to our basic subscribers 
service costs increased  primarily due to increases in programming expenses  employee costs and plant operating costs 
the largest component of service costs is programming related expense which increased  as a result of rate increases on basic and premium services  significantly offset by a reduction in basic subscribers and an increase in launch support received from programmers in return for our carriage of their programming services 
employee and plant operating costs increased  primarily due to increases in employee benefits  operational insurance claims and the expensing of such operational costs resulting from the continued transition from upgrade construction in to maintenance activities in service costs as a percentage of revenues were for the year ended december   as compared with for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses include wages and salaries for our call center  customer service and support and administrative personnel  franchise fees and taxes  and expenses related to billing  telecommunications  marketing  bad debt  advertising and office administration 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  principally due to higher advertising  marketing and employee costs and higher taxes and fees  partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense 
advertising costs increased as a result of employee commissions on increased revenues 
employee costs increased as a result of increases in employee compensation  benefit costs and customer service overtime  driven by higher call volumes related to the rollout of new products 
marketing costs rose as a result of mass media campaigns to support the rollout of new advanced services  and to promote customer retention and acquisition initiatives 
taxes and fees increased due to higher state property taxes 
this increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was partly offset by a decrease in bad debt expense as a result of improved customer credit and collection policies 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were for the year ended december   as compared with for the year ended december  we expect continued revenue growth in advanced services  which include digital video  hdtv and broadband data access and  in the second quarter of  the launch of cable telephony service 
as a result  we expect our service costs and selling  general and administrative expenses to increase 
corporate expenses reflect compensation of corporate employees and other corporate overhead 
corporate expenses increased  primarily due to increases in legal and accounting fees  general insurance expenses and employee costs offset by greater capitalization of labor and overhead costs related to increased capital activities in related to the cable telephony project 
corporate expenses as a percentage of revenues were for the year ended december   as compared with for the year ended december  
table of contents depreciation and amortization decreased  primarily due to changes  effective july   in the estimated useful lives of our cable systems and equipment in conjunction with the completion of our network upgrade and rebuild program  this was offset in part by increased depreciation for investments in our cable network and ongoing investments to continue the rollout of products and services including video on demand  high definition television  digital video recorders and broadband data access 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
interest expense  net interest expense  net  increased by  primarily due to slightly higher market interest rates on variable rate debt and lower interest expense capitalization associated with the substantial reduction of upgrade rebuild capital expenditures  partially offset by lower indebtedness 
gain on derivatives  net we enter into interest rate exchange agreements  or interest rate swaps  with counterparties to fix the interest rate on a portion of our variable rate debt to reduce the potential volatility in our interest expense that would otherwise result from changes in market interest rates 
as of december  we had interest rate swaps with an aggregate principal amount of million 
the changes in their mark to market values are derived from changes in market interest rates  the decrease in their time to maturity and the creditworthiness of the counterparties 
as a result of the quarterly mark to market valuation of these interest rate swaps  we recorded a gain on derivatives amounting to million for the year ended december   as compared to a gain on derivatives of million for the year ended december  gain loss on sale of assets and investments  net we had a net gain on sale of assets and investments amounting to million for the year ended december  as compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  the net gain was principally due to the sale of a cable system in may  serving approximately  subscribers  for gross proceeds of about million 
other expense other expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
other expense primarily represents amortization of deferred financing costs and fees on unused credit commitments 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes was approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the provision for income taxes relates to state income tax liabilities 
net income loss as a result of the factors described above  we generated net income for the year ended december  of million  as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december

video revenues increased as a result of the aforementioned basic rate increases  partially offset by a decline in basic subscribers  after adjusting for  small acquisitions and divestitures during our loss in basic subscribers resulted primarily from greater competitive pressures by dbs service providers  particularly in those markets where we experienced their local to local launches 
data revenues rose due  in large part  to a increase in data customers from  to  advertising revenues increased primarily as a result of bringing in house certain markets previously managed by third parties 
instead of receiving advertising revenues which are net of commissions paid to the third parties  we now record the full revenues from these markets with the related expenses  including in house commissions  which are recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses 

table of contents costs and expenses service costs increased over the prior year  which included million of one time incremental costs related to our transition to our mediacom online high speed internet access service 
these costs represented the excess over the agreed upon charges owed to our former high speed provider that were incurred in the first quarter of excluding these incremental costs  service costs would have increased or million 
approximately half of this increase was due to servicing the growth in our data customers of  with the balance primarily represented by increases in unit costs for basic programming 
the increase in total programming costs  however  was partially offset by the aforementioned decline in basic subscribers as well as a decrease in premium service units 
as a percentage of revenues  service costs were for the year ended december   as compared with for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses increased  principally due to higher customer support  marketing  call center and bad debt expenses  and higher taxes and fees 
customer support expenses increased as a result of higher staffing levels and employee commissions 
marketing expenses rose to support the digital television and data products and services  to cover the costs of advertising campaigns we deployed to counter competitive pressures from dbs  and to pay commissions to our marketing personnel 
expenses relating to our call centers  mainly customer service personnel and telecommunications  increased as a result of increased staffing and higher call volumes experienced during the year 
bad debt expense rose primarily as a result of higher customer churn and the implementation throughout the year of tighter customer credit controls 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were for the year ended december   as compared with for the year ended december  corporate expenses decreased  primarily due to the recognition of million of non cash stock charges during the year ended december   which represented vesting in equity interests granted to certain members of our management team  offset by a greater number of corporate employees and increases in salaries  legal and other professional fees  and insurance premiums 
as a percentage of revenues  corporate expenses were for the year ended december   as compared with for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization decreased  primarily due to changes  effective july   in the estimated useful lives of our cable systems and equipment in conjunction with the completion of our network upgrade and rebuild program 
these changes reduced depreciation by million for the year ended december  this decrease was offset in part by increased depreciation for investments in our cable network and ongoing investments to continue the rollout of products and services such as video on demand  high definition television and high speed internet access 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
interest expense  net interest expense  net  remained relatively flat year over year 
this was primarily due to higher average indebtedness offset by a decrease in market interest rates on our variable rate debt 
gain loss on derivative instruments  net we enter into interest rate exchange agreements  or interest rate swaps  to fix the interest rate on a portion of our variable rate debt to reduce the potential volatility in our interest expense due to changes in variable market interest rates 
as of december  we had interest rate swaps with an aggregate principal amount of million  compared to million as of december  the changes in their mark to market values are derived from changes in market interest rates  the decrease in their time to maturity and the creditworthiness of the counterparties 
as a result of the quarterly mark to market valuation of these interest rate swaps  we recorded a gain on derivative instruments amounting to million for the year ended december   as compared to loss on derivative instruments of million for the year ended december  
table of contents loss on sale of assets and investments  net we had a loss on the sale of assets and investments amounting to million for the year ended december  the loss was principally due to a sale of a small cable system in september with approximately  subscribers for gross proceeds of million 
other expense other expense was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  other expense primarily represents amortization of deferred financing costs and fees on unused credit commitments 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes was approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the provision for income taxes relates to state income tax liabilities 
net loss due to the factors described above  we generated a net loss of million and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources in recent years  we have made significant capital investments in our cable systems to enhance their reliability and capacity  which allows for the introduction of new advanced broadband services 
our capital investments are now more focused on the deployment of new products and services  including vod  dvrs  hsd and cable telephony 
we also may continue to make strategic acquisitions of cable systems 
given our level of indebtedness  we also have significant amounts of interest expense to pay each year 
we believe that we will meet our debt service  capital spending and other requirements through a combination of our net cash flows from operating activities  borrowing availability under our bank credit facilities and our ability to secure future external financing 
operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the prior year  and reflected primarily our operating income before depreciation and amortization and  to a much lesser extent  changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
investing activities net cash flows used in investing activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the prior year  and principally comprised capital expenditures 
for the year ended december   we made capital expenditures of million  including million to replace or rebuild property  plant and equipment damaged by hurricane ivan and million to fund our cable telephony initiative 
this compares to million and million we invested in and  respectively  which reflected significantly higher levels of capital expenditures for network upgrade and rebuild activities than in this reduction in capital expenditures resulted primarily from the completion of our planned network upgrade program in a larger percentage of our capital spending in was attributable to the deployment of our advanced products and services  including vod  hdtv and hsd  and our preparation for the launch of cable telephony 
in  approximately of our capital expenditures was for advanced product and service deployment and cable telephony  was for rebuild and upgrade activities  including modifications to our cable network  was for extensions of our cable network to enter new service territories  and was for outlays associated with non network assets 
this trend of spending more on the deployment of advanced products and services as compared to network improvements is expected to continue in and beyond 
we plan to invest between million and million in capital expenditures in 
table of contents during  we also acquired a small cable system for million and received million in proceeds from the sale of assets and investments  including the divestiture of a small cable system 
financing activities net cash flows used in financing activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to million of net cash flows provided by financing activities the prior year 
in  our principal financing activities included the repayment of bank indebtedness in the amount of million and repurchase of shares of our class a common stock in the amount of million 
description of our credit facilities we own our cable systems through two principal subsidiaries  mediacom broadband llc and mediacom llc 
in october  the operating subsidiaries of mediacom llc refinanced their two bank credit facilities the two prior llc credit facilities with a new billion bank credit facility the llc credit facility that expires in march the llc credit facility consists of a million revolving credit commitment  a million delayed draw term loan and a million term loan  which are subject to amortization  as applicable 
approximately million was drawn from the llc credit facility at closing  of which approximately million was used to pay in full the outstanding indebtedness  including accrued interest  under the two prior llc credit facilities and the balance was used to pay fees and expenses related to this new credit facility 
the financial obligations of the operating subsidiaries under the two prior llc credit facilities have been satisfied  and these credit facilities have been terminated 
as of december   million was outstanding under the llc credit facility 
in january  we borrowed the entire amount of the million term loan and repaid a portion of our indebtedness under our revolving credit commitments 
the operating subsidiaries of mediacom broadband llc have a billion bank credit facility the broadband credit facility that expires in september and consists of a million revolving credit commitment  a million term loan and a million term loan  which are subject to commitment reductions and amortization  as applicable 
in december  these operating subsidiaries amended their bank credit agreement to conform its definitions  financial covenants  and other terms including those relating to letters of credit  mandatory prepayment  representations and warranties  negative covenants and events of default to those of the credit agreement of the llc credit facility 
as of december   million was outstanding under the broadband credit facility 
we have entered into interest rate exchange agreements  which expire from june through march  to hedge million of floating rate debt 
under the terms of all of our interest rate exchange agreements  we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements 
however  due to the high creditworthiness of our counterparties  which are major banking firms with investment grade ratings  we do not anticipate their nonperformance 
as of december   about of the company s outstanding indebtedness was at fixed interest rates or subject to interest rate protection 
as of december   our total debt was approximately billion and we were in compliance with all covenants under our debt arrangements 
on that same date  our annualized cost of debt was approximately  and we had unused revolving commitments under our credit facilities of about million  all of which could be borrowed and used for general corporate purposes based on the terms and conditions of our debt arrangements  including the applicable financial measures of leverage and interest coverage 
the average interest rate for borrowings under the revolving commitments of our credit facilities is now libor plus as of december   approximately million of letters of credit were issued to various parties to secure our performance relating to insurance and franchise requirements 
although we have not generated earnings sufficient to cover fixed charges in the past  we have generated cash and obtained financing sufficient to meet our short term requirements  including our debt service  working capital and capital expenditures 
we expect that we will continue to be able to generate funds and obtain financing sufficient to service our long term business plan  service our debt obligations and complete any future acquisitions if the opportunities arise 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing  or  if we were able to do so  that the terms would be favorable to us 

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments  and the effects they are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow  for the five years subsequent to december  and thereafter dollars in thousands capital operating debt leases leases total thereafter total cash obligations refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our long term debt  and to note for a discussion of our operating leases and other commitments and contingencies 
includes million of convertible senior notes due excludes interest expense 
critical accounting policies the foregoing discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
periodically  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to doubtful accounts  long lived assets  capitalized costs and accruals 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of our accounting policies  see note of our consolidated financial statements 
property  plant and equipment we capitalize the costs of new construction and replacement of our cable transmission and distribution facilities and new cable service installations 
capitalized costs include all direct labor and materials as well as certain indirect costs and are based on historical construction and installation costs 
capitalized costs are recorded as additions to property  plant and equipment and depreciate over the life of the related asset 
we perform periodic evaluations of the estimates used to determine the amount of costs that are capitalized 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method as stipulated by sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
this method generally provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and anticipated benefit of utilizing net operating loss carryforwards 
we assess the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets and net operating loss carryforwards by considering the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  taxable income in future periods and available prudent tax planning strategies 
at december   we have recorded a net deferred tax asset valuation allowance of approximately million 
we will continue to monitor the need for the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in accordance 
table of contents with sfas no 
should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our valuation allowance would decrease or increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery of our deferred tax assets were either likely or unlikely  respectively 
intangibles our cable systems operate under non exclusive franchises granted by state and local governmental authorities for varying lengths of time 
we acquired these cable franchises through acquisitions of cable systems and were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
we have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since  among other things  there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic or other factors limiting the period over which these cable franchise rights contribute to our revenues 
accordingly  with our adoption of sfas no 
we no longer amortize the cable franchise rights and other indefinite lived assets 
instead  such assets are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
based on the guidance outlined in emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 we determined that the unit of accounting for testing franchise value for impairment resides at a cable system cluster level 
such level reflects the financial reporting level managed and reviewed by the corporate office ie  chief operating decision maker as well as how we allocated capital resources and utilize the assets 
lastly  the unit reporting level reflects the level at which the purchase method of accounting for our acquisitions was originally recorded 
we have three cable system clusters  or reporting units  for the purpose of applying sfas no 
we assess the fair value of our franchise costs based on a discounted cash flow methodology 
if the determined fair value of our franchise costs is less the carrying amount on the financial statements  an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the assets 
to test the impairment of the goodwill carried on our financial statements  the fair value of the cable system cluster s tangible and intangible assets including franchise value other than goodwill is deducted from the cable system cluster s fair value 
the balance represents the fair value of goodwill which is then compared to the carrying value of goodwill to determine if there is any impairment 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we determined that no impairment of our franchise costs and goodwill existed as of january  subsequent impairment tests performed in and reflected no impairment of our franchise costs and goodwill 
we completed our most recent impairment test as of october   which reflected no impairment of our franchise costs and goodwill 
our use of discounted cash flow analyses in determining the fair value of each cable system cluster involves certain assumptions and estimates  which are consistent with the expectations of buyers and sellers of cable systems in determining fair value 
significant impairment in value resulting in impairment charges may result if these estimates and assumptions used in the fair value determination change in the future 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically evaluate the recoverability and estimated lives of our long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed 
the measurement for such impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset  typically based upon the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
unless presented separately  the loss is included as a component of either depreciation expense or amortization expense  as appropriate 
derivatives we account for derivatives instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 sfas no 
and sfas no 
our primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage interest rate risk 
our derivative instruments are recorded at fair value and are included in other current assets  other assets and other liabilities 
our accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether they meet our criteria for designation as hedging transactions 
the criteria for designating a derivative as a hedge include the instrument s effectiveness in risk reduction and  in most cases  a one to one matching of the derivative instrument to its underlying transaction 
gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are recognized currently in earnings 
during  and  none of our derivative financial instruments were designated as hedges 
therefore  changes in fair value for the respective periods were recognized in earnings 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  in december  which amends i sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  ii the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation  and iii accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  we did not change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
did not affect our financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  amendment of statement on share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires companies to expense the value of employee stock options  stock granted through the employee stock purchase program and similar awards 
sfas no 
r is effective for periods beginning after june  we plan on adopting sfas no 
r effective july  and expect that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
there are three methods of adopting sfas no 
r 
the first method is called modified prospective method  which allows companies to avoid recording additional compensation expense for vested awards that are outstanding on the effective date of the sfas no 
r 
unvested awards outstanding on the effective date would be charged to expense over the remaining vesting period 
the second method is similar to the modified prospective method  except it allows companies to restate earlier interim periods in the year of adoption using the applicable sfas r pro forma amounts 
the third method is the modified retrospective method  which directs companies to apply the modified prospective method and restate prior financial statements 
we are currently evaluating these transitional methods 
in march  the fasb approved the consensus reached on the eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the issue s objective is to provide guidance for identifying other than temporarily impaired investments 
eitf also provides new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb issued a fasb staff position fsp eitf that delays the effective date of the measurement and recognition guidance in eitf until further notice 
the disclosure requirements of eitf are effective with this annual report for fiscal once the fasb reaches a final decision on the measurement and recognition provisions  we will evaluate the impact of the adoption of the accounting provision of eitf in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
the guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of assets exchanged 
the guidance in that opinion  however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
this statement amends opinion to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
inflation and changing prices our systems costs and expenses are subject to inflation and price fluctuations 
such changes in costs and expenses can generally be passed through to subscribers 
programming costs have historically increased at rates in excess of inflation and are expected to continue to do so 
we believe that under the fcc s existing cable rate regulations we may increase rates for cable television services to more than cover any increases in programming 
however  competitive conditions and other factors in the marketplace may limit our ability to increase our rates 

table of contents risk factors risks related to our business we have a history of net losses 
we have a history of net losses 
although we reported net income of million for the year ended december   we reported net losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the principal reasons for our prior net losses include the depreciation and amortization expenses associated with our acquisitions  the capital expenditures related to expanding and upgrading our cable systems and interest costs on borrowed money 
if we are unsuccessful in implementing our growth strategy  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we currently expect that a substantial portion of our future growth in revenues will come from the expansion of relatively new services and the introduction of additional new services 
relatively new services include hsd  vod  dvrs and hdtv 
we plan to offer cable telephony service to our subscribers beginning with certain markets in the second quarter of and expanding to an additional million homes in our markets within twelve months of our initial market launch 
we may not be able to successfully expand existing services or introduce cable telephony due to unpredictable technical  operational or regulatory challenges 
it is also possible that these services will not generate significant revenue growth 
our programming costs are increasing  and our business and results of operations will be adversely affected if we cannot pass through a sufficient part of the additional costs to subscribers 
our programming costs have been  and are expected to continue to be  one of our largest single expense items 
in recent years  the cable and satellite video industries have experienced a rapid increase in the cost of programming  particularly sports programming 
this increase in programming costs is expected to continue  and we may not be able to pass all programming cost increases on to our customers 
in addition  as we add programming to our basic and expanded basic programming tiers  we may not be able to pass all of our costs of the additional programming on to our customers without the potential loss of basic subscribers 
to the extent that we may not be able to pass increased or additional programming costs  particularly sports programming  through to subscribers  our business and results of operations will be adversely affected 
we also expect to be subject to increasing financial and other demands by broadcasters to obtain the required consents for the transmission of broadcast programming to our subscribers 
we cannot predict the impact of these negotiations on our business and results of operations or the effect on our subscribers should we be required to suspend the carriage of this programming 
we operate in a highly competitive business environment  which affects our ability to attract and retain customers and can adversely affect our business and operations 
we have lost a significant number of customers to direct broadcast satellite competition  and further loss of customers could have a material negative impact on our business 
the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and is often subject to rapid and significant changes and developments in the marketplace and in the regulatory and legislative environment 
in some instances  we compete against companies with fewer regulatory burdens  easier access to financing  greater resources and operating capabilities  greater brand name recognition and long standing relationships with regulatory authorities and customers 
our video business faces competition primarily from dbs service providers 
our principal competitor in the hsd business  in markets where it is available  is telephone service  or dsl 
the two largest dbs companies  directv  inc and echostar communications  are each among the four largest providers of multichannel video programming services based on reported customers 
in addition  directv s affiliation with news corporation could strengthen that company s competitive positioning  as news corporation also owns fox television network and several cable programming services 
competition from dbs has had an adverse effect on our ability to retain customers 
dbs has 
table of contents grown rapidly over the past several years and continue to do so 
we have lost a significant number of customers to dbs competition  and will continue to face significant challenges from dbs providers 
local telephone companies  electric utilities and other municipal organizations are capable of offering video and other services in competition with us and they may increasingly do so in the future 
certain telephone companies have begun to deploy fiber more extensively in their networks and some have announced plans to deploy broadband services  including video programming services  in a manner to avoid the same regulatory burdens imposed on our business 
these deployments will enable them to begin providing video services  as well as telephone and internet access services  to residential and business customers 
new laws or regulations at the federal or state level may clarify the ability of the local telephone companies to provide their services without obtaining state or local cable franchises 
if local telephone companies are not required to obtain local cable franchises comparable to ours  it would be adverse to our business 
we also face competition from over the air television and radio broadcasters and from other communications and entertainment media such as movie theaters  live entertainment and sports events  newspapers and home video products 
further losses of customers to dbs or other alternative video and hsd services could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in our hsd business  we face competition primarily from telephone companies and other providers of dial up and dsl 
dsl service is competitive with hsd service over cable systems 
telephone companies which already have telephone lines into the household  an existing customer base and other operational functions in place and other companies offer dsl service 
in addition  certain dbs providers are currently offering two way broadband data access services  which compete with our ability to offer bundled services to our customers 
our hsd business may also face competition in the future from registered utility holding companies and subsidiaries in  the fcc adopted rules i that affirmed the ability of electric service providers to provide broadband internet access services over their distribution systems  and ii that seek to avoid interference with existing services 
electric utilities could be formidable competitors to us 
some of our competitors  including franchised  wireless or private cable operators  satellite television providers and local exchange carriers  may benefit from permanent or temporary business combinations such as mergers  joint ventures and alliances and the potential repeal of certain ownership rules  either through access to financing  resources or efficiencies of scale  or the ability to provide multiple services in direct competition with us 
if we are unable to keep pace with technological change  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change and the introduction of new products and services 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to fund the capital expenditures necessary to keep pace with future technological developments 
we also cannot assure you that we will successfully anticipate the demand of our customers for products and services requiring new technology 
this type of rapid technological change could adversely affect our ability to maintain  expand or upgrade our systems and respond to competitive pressures 
an inability to maintain and expand our systems and provide advanced services in a timely manner  or to anticipate the demands of the market place  could adversely affect our ability to compete and our results of operations 
the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our success is substantially dependent upon the retention and continued performance of our key personnel  including rocco b 
commisso  our chairman and chief executive officer 
we have not entered into a long term employment agreement with mr 
commisso 
if mr 
commisso or any of our other key personnel cease to be employed by us for any reason  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we do not currently maintain key man life insurance on mr 
commisso or other key personnel 

table of contents we may not be able to obtain critical items at a reasonable cost or when required  which could adversely affect business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on third party suppliers for equipment  software  services and other items that are critical for the operation of our cable systems and the provision of advanced services  including digital set top converter boxes  digital video recorders and routers  fiber optic cable  telephone circuits  software  the backbone telecommunications network for our high speed data service and construction services for expansion and upgrades of our cable systems 
these items are available from a limited number of suppliers 
demand for these items has increased with the general growth in demand for internet and telecommunications services 
we typically do not carry significant inventories of equipment 
moreover  if there are no suppliers that are able to provide set top converter boxes that comply with evolving internet and telecommunications standards or that are compatible with other equipment and software that we use  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
if we are unable to obtain critical equipment  software  services or other items on a timely basis and at an acceptable cost  our ability to offer our products and services and roll out advanced services may be impaired  and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
risks related to indebtedness of us and our operating subsidiaries we are a holding company with no operations and we depend on our operating subsidiaries for cash to fund our obligations 
as a holding company  we do not have any operations or hold any assets other than our investments in and our advances to our operating subsidiaries 
consequently  our subsidiaries conduct all of our consolidated operations and own substantially all of our consolidated assets 
the only source of cash we have to pay interest on  and repay the principal of  our indebtedness and to meet our other obligations is the cash that our subsidiaries generate from their operations and their borrowings 
our subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available to us 
our subsidiaries ability to make payments to us will depend upon their operating results and will be subject to applicable laws and contractual restrictions  including the agreements governing our subsidiary credit facilities and other indebtedness 
those agreements permit our subsidiaries to distribute cash to us under certain circumstances  but only so long as there is no default under any of such agreements 
we have substantial existing debt and have significant interest payment requirements  which could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing in the future and require our operating subsidiaries to apply a substantial portion of their cash flow to debt service 
our total debt as of december  was approximately billion 
our interest expense for the year ended december  was million 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows to permit us  or our subsidiaries  to repay indebtedness or that refinancing of that indebtedness will be possible on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
this high level of debt and our debt service obligations could have material consequences  including that our ability to access new sources of financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes may be limited  we may need to use a large portion of our revenues to pay interest on borrowings under our subsidiary credit facilities and our senior notes  which will reduce the amount of money available to finance our operations  capital expenditures and other activities  some of our debt has a variable rate of interest  which may expose us to the risk of increased interest rates  we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business  we may be less flexible in responding to changing business and economic conditions  including increased competition and demand for new products and services  we may be at a disadvantage when compared to those of our competitors that have less debt  and we may not be able to fully implement our business strategy 

table of contents a default under our indentures or our subsidiary credit facilities could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness and other material adverse effects 
the agreements and instruments governing our own and our subsidiaries indebtedness contain numerous financial and operating covenants 
the breach of any of these covenants could cause a default  which could result in the indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable 
if this were to occur  we would be unable to adequately finance our operations 
in addition  a default could result in a default or acceleration of our other indebtedness subject to cross default provisions 
if this occurs  we may not be able to pay our debts or borrow sufficient funds to refinance them 
even if new financing is available  it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us 
the membership interests of our operating subsidiaries are pledged as collateral under the respective subsidiary credit facilities 
a default under one of our subsidiary credit facilities could result in a foreclosure by the lenders on the membership interests pledged under that facility 
because we are dependent upon our operating subsidiaries for all of our revenues  a foreclosure would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the terms of our indebtedness could materially limit our financial and operating flexibility 
several of the covenants contained in the agreements and instruments governing our own and our subsidiaries indebtedness could materially limit our financial and operating flexibility by restricting  among other things  our ability and the ability of our operating subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  create liens and other encumbrances  pay dividends and make other payments  investments  loans and guarantees  enter into transactions with related parties  sell or otherwise dispose of assets and merge or consolidate with another entity  repurchase or redeem capital stock  other equity interests or debt  pledge assets  and issue capital stock or other equity interests 
complying with these covenants could cause us to take actions that we otherwise would not take or cause us not to take actions that we otherwise would take 
we may not be able to obtain additional capital to continue the development of our business 
we have invested substantial capital for the upgrade  expansion and maintenance of our cable systems and the launch and expansion of new or additional products and services 
while we have completed our planned system upgrades  if there is accelerated growth in our video  hsd and voice products and services  or we decide to introduce other new advanced products and services  or the cost to provide these products and services increases  we may need to make unplanned additional capital expenditures 
we may not be able to obtain the funds necessary to finance additional capital requirements through internally generated funds  additional borrowings or other sources 
if we are unable to obtain these funds  we would not be able to implement our business strategy and our results of operations would be adversely affected 

table of contents risks related to legislative and regulatory matters our cable television business is subject to extensive governmental regulation 
the cable television industry is subject to extensive legislation and regulation at the federal and local levels  and  in some instances  at the state level 
many aspects of such regulation are currently the subject of judicial and administrative proceedings and legislative and administrative proposals 
we expect that court actions and regulatory proceedings will continue to refine our rights and obligations under applicable federal  state and local laws 
the results of these judicial and administrative proceedings and legislative activities may materially affect our business operations 
local authorities grant us non exclusive franchises that permit us to operate our cable systems 
we renew or renegotiate these franchises from time to time 
local franchising authorities may demand concessions  or other commitments  as a condition to renewal  and these concessions or other commitments could be costly 
the communications act contains renewal procedures and criteria designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials of renewal  and although such act requires the local franchising authorities to take into account the costs of meeting such concessions or commitments  there is no assurance that we will not be compelled to meet their demands in order to obtain renewals 
we cannot predict whether any of the markets in which we operate will expand the regulation of our cable systems in the future or the impact that any such expanded regulation may have upon our business 
similarly  due to the increasing popularity and use of commercial online services and the internet  certain aspects have become subject to regulation at the federal and state level such as collection of information online from children  disclosure of certain subscriber information to governmental agencies  commercial emails or spam  privacy  security and distribution of material in violation of copyrights 
in addition to the possibility that additional federal laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to commercial online services and the internet  it is possible that individual states may also impose such restrictions  potentially creating an intricate patchwork of laws and regulations 
future federal and or state laws may cover such issues as privacy  access to some types of content by minors  pricing  encryption standards  consumer protection  electronic commerce  taxation of e commerce  copyright infringement and other intellectual property matters 
the adoption of such laws or regulations in the future may decrease the growth of such services and the internet  which could in turn decrease the demand for our cable modem service  increase our costs of providing such service or have other adverse effects on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in channel carriage regulations could impose significant additional costs on us 
cable operators face significant regulation of their channel carriage 
currently  they can be required to devote substantial capacity to the carriage of programming that they would not carry voluntarily  including certain local broadcast signals  local public  educational and government access programming  and unaffiliated commercial leased access programming 
if the fcc or congress were to require cable systems to carry both the analog and digital versions of local broadcast signals or to carry multiple program streams included with a single digital broadcast transmission  this carriage burden would increase substantially 
recently  the fcc reaffirmed that cable operators need only carry one programming service of each television broadcaster to fulfill its must carry obligation 
our franchises are non exclusive and local franchising authorities may grant competing franchises in our markets 
our cable systems are operated under non exclusive franchises granted by local franchising authorities 
as a result  competing operators of cable systems and other potential competitors  such as municipal utility providers  may be granted franchises and may build cable systems in markets where we hold franchises 
any such competition could adversely affect our business 
the existence of multiple cable systems in the same geographic area is generally referred to as an overbuild 
as of the filing date of this report  approximately of the estimated homes passed by our cable systems were overbuilt by other cable operators 
we cannot assure you that competition from overbuilders will not develop in other markets that we now serve or will serve after any future acquisitions 

table of contents pending fcc and court proceedings could adversely affect our hsd service 
the legal and regulatory status of providing high speed internet access service by cable television companies is uncertain 
the adoption of new rules by the fcc or rulings in court proceedings could place additional costs and regulatory burdens on us  reduce our anticipated revenues or increase our anticipated costs for this service  complicate the franchise renewal process  result in greater competition or otherwise adversely affect our business 
the fcc has issued a declaratory ruling that cable modem service  as it is currently offered  is properly classified as an interstate information service that is not subject to common carrier regulation 
however  the fcc is still considering the following whether to require cable companies to provide capacity on their systems to other entities to deliver high speed internet directly to customers  also known as open access  whether certain other regulatory requirements do or should apply to cable modem service  and whether and to what extent cable modem service should be subject to local franchise authorities regulatory requirements or franchise fees 
there can be no assurance that regulatory authorities will not impose open access or similar requirements on us as part of an industry wide requirement 
such requirements could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations 
challenges to the fcc s classification of cable internet access service as an information service and not a cable service or a telecommunications service have been addressed by a federal appellate court 
based on a finding that it was bound by an earlier decision  the appellate court overturned the fcc s classification and found cable internet service to include both information service and telecommunications service components 
the united states supreme court has agreed to review the appellate court s decision 
if the appellate court s decision prevails  it could result in an open access requirement and other obligations imposed on telecommunications carriers  which would be adverse to us 
we may be subject to legal liability because of the acts of our hsd customers or because of our own negligence 
our hsd service enables individuals to access the internet and to exchange information  generate content  conduct business and engage in various online activities on an international basis 
the law relating to the liability of providers of these online services for activities of their users is currently unsettled both within the united states and abroad 
potentially  third parties could seek to hold us liable for the actions and omissions of our cable modem service customers  such as defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  fraud or other theories based on the nature and content of information that our customers use our service to post  download or distribute 
we also could be subject to similar claims based on the content of other websites to which we provide links or third party products  services or content that we may offer through our internet service 
due to the global nature of the web  it is possible that the governments of other states and foreign countries might attempt to regulate its transmissions or prosecute us for violations of their laws 
it is also possible that information provided directly by us will contain errors or otherwise be negligently provided to users  resulting in third parties making claims against us 
for example  we offer web based email services  which expose us to potential risks  such as liabilities or claims resulting from unsolicited email  lost or misdirected messages  illegal or fraudulent use of email  or interruptions or delays in email service 
additionally  we host website portal pages designed for use as a home page by  but not limited to  our hsd customers 
these portal pages offer a wide variety of content from third parties which could contain errors or other material that could give rise to liability 
to date  no one has filed such a claim against us 
however  in the future someone may file such a claim against us in either a domestic or international jurisdiction and may succeed in imposing liability on us 
our defense of any such actions could be costly and involve significant distraction of our management and other resources 
if we are held or threatened with significant liability  we may decide to take actions to reduce our exposure to this type of liability 
this may require us to spend significant amounts of money for new equipment and may also require us to discontinue offering some features or our cable modem service 
since we launched our proprietary mediacom online sm hsd service in february  from time to time  we receive notices of claimed infringements by our cable modem service users 
the owners of copyrights and trademarks have been increasingly active in seeking to prevent use of the internet to violate their rights 
in many cases  their claims of infringement are based on the acts of customers of an internet service provider for example  a customer s use of an internet service or the resources it provides to post  download or disseminate copyrighted music  movies  software or other content without the consent of the copyright owner or to seek to profit from the use of the goodwill associated with another person s trademark 
in some cases  copyright and trademark owners have sought to recover damages from the internet service provider  as well as or instead of the customer 
the law relating to the potential liability of internet service providers in these circumstances is unsettled 
in  congress adopted the digital millennium copyright act  
table of contents which is intended to grant isps protection against certain claims of copyright infringement resulting from the actions of customers  provided that the isp complies with certain requirements 
so far  congress has not adopted similar protections for trademark infringement claims 
we may be required to provide access to our networks to other internet service providers  which could significantly increase our competition and adversely affect our ability to provide new products and services 
local authorities and the fcc have been asked to require cable operators to provide non discriminatory access over their cable systems to other internet service providers 
a federal court in each of california  virginia and florida has struck down these open access requirements imposed by a variety of franchising authorities as unlawful 
each of these courts used different legal grounds to strike down the open access requirements 
however  an appellate court has found that cable modem service is part telecommunications service and part information service 
the us supreme court has agreed to hear an appeal of that decision 
if not overturned  the decision could potentially result in open access being imposed on us 
if we are required to provide access in this manner  it could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results  including by i increasing competition  ii increasing the expenses we incur to maintain our systems  and or iii increasing the expense of upgrading and or expanding our systems 
we may become subject to additional regulatory burdens when we offer cable telephony service 
the regulatory obligations of voip are currently under consideration by the fcc and state authorities 
if our planned cable telephony service is deemed by regulators to be a telecommunications service or a state regulated telephone service  such service could subject us to significant regulation as well as higher fees for pole attachments 
the additional regulatory requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and we may not be able to meet them in a timely manner 
actions by pole owners might subject us to significantly increased pole attachment costs 
our cable facilities are often attached to or use public utility poles  ducts or conduits 
historically  cable system attachments to public utility poles have been regulated at the federal or state level 
generally this regulation resulted in favorable pole attachment rates for attachments used to provide cable service 
the fcc clarified that the provision of internet access does not endanger a cable operator s favorable pole rates  this approach ultimately was upheld by the supreme court of the united states 
however  an appellate court has subsequently held that cable modem service is not cable service but is part telecommunications service and part information service  which possibly could lead to higher pole attachment rates 
the us supreme court has agreed to hear an appeal of the lower court s decision 
as a result of this uncertainty  utility pole owners in many areas are attempting to raise pole attachment rates and impose additional costs on cable operators and others 
in addition  utility companies can increase the favorable pole attachment rates afforded cable operators under federal law if the operator provides telecommunications services  as well as cable service  over plant attached to utility poles 
our financial results could suffer a material adverse impact from any significant increased costs  and such increased pole attachment costs could discourage system upgrades and the introduction of new products and services 
risks related to our chairman and chief executive officer s controlling position our chairman and chief executive officer has the ability to control all major corporate decisions  and a sale of his stock could result in a change of control that would have unpredictable effects 
rocco b 
commisso  our chairman and chief executive officer  beneficially owned our common stock representing approximately of the combined voting power as of december  as a result  mr 
commisso will generally have the ability to control the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of our entire board of directors  the approval of any merger or consolidation and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  mr 
commisso s voting power may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire mediacom because any such acquisition would require his consent 
we cannot assure you that mr 
commisso will maintain all or any portion of his ownership or that he would continue as an officer or director if he sold a significant part of his stock 
the disposition by mr 
commisso of a sufficient number of shares could result in a change in control of our company  and we cannot assure you that a change of control would not adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
as noted above  it could also result in a default under our subsidiary credit agreements and could also trigger a variety of federal  state and local regulatory consent requirements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we use interest rate exchange agreements interest rate swaps with counterparties to fix the interest rate on a portion of our variable interest rate debt 
as of december   we had million of interest rate swaps with various banks with a weighted average fixed rate of approximately 
the fixed rates of the interest rate swaps are offset against the applicable three month london interbank offering rate to determine the related interest expense 
under the terms of the interest rate exchange agreements  which expire from through  we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other parties 
however  due to the high creditworthiness of our counterparties  which are major banking firms with investment grade ratings  we do not anticipate their nonperformance 
at december   based on the mark to market valuation  we would have received approximately million  including accrued interest  if we terminated these agreements 
the table below provides the expected maturity and estimated fair value of our debt as of december  all dollars in thousands
