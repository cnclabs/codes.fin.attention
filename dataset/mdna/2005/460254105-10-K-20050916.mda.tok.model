we plan to support our non focus products to the extent we believe appropriate  to manage  maintain or increase their value in line with our long term goals for those segments 
refer to item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal and note to consolidated financial statements  segment and geographic information  for further discussions about our business segments 
product categories and segments we use our technology  comprehensive experience in power management  and low cost manufacturing platforms to offer what we believe is one of the industry s most advanced and competitive lines of power management products 
our products are divided among three general product categories 
these products may be sold across one or more reportable segments power management integrated circuits and advanced circuit devices 
our power management integrated circuits  or power management ics  are analog  mixed signal  and digital semiconductors that integrate logic and or power management functions on the same chip to optimize system performance 
advanced circuit devices are chipsets  multi chip modules and other advanced performance devices that generally address power management requirements in demanding applications  and which we do not consider to be commodity in nature 
our power management ics and advanced circuit devices provide application specific power management solutions for computers  servers and routers  consumer electronics  energy saving appliances and other motor control applications  aircraft and satellites  defense electronic systems  wireless and wireline communication devices and certain automotive applications 
power components 
power components are discrete devices used in general power management applications 
these include metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors mosfets and insulated gate bipolar transistors igbts  regulators  rectifiers  diodes  thyristors and interfaces 
power mosfets and igbts rapidly and efficiently switch electricity on and off in order to supply power in a form that can be formatted to the specific requirements of a circuit 
our power components are used in virtually all our end markets 
power systems 
power systems combine power semiconductors with other power management components in modules that improve power efficiency  provide a cost effective alternative to custom analog designs and enable customers to introduce new products more quickly 
we supply power systems as modules for automotive electronics including electric fan control  electric power steering and integrated starter alternator motors  other motor control applications including industrial refrigeration and air conditioning  and commercial and military aircraft 
we report in six segments that generally reflect our products end markets 
our chief operating decision maker codm for financial accounting purposes is our chief executive officer who reviews the revenues and gross margin results for each of these segments in making decisions about allocating resources  including the focus of research and development activities  and assessing performance 
we do not allocate assets  sales and marketing  information systems  finance and administrative costs to the operating segments  as these are not meaningful statistics to the codm in making resource allocation decisions or in evaluating performance of the operating segments 
we further summarize our segments into two groups  focus products and non focus products  to reflect our strategic goals and the allocation of our critical resources 
our focus product segments are computing and communications c c the computing and communication segment is comprised of our power management ics  advanced circuit devices  including ipowir multi chip modules and directfet solutions  and power components primarily hexfet power components that address servers and high end desktops  notebooks  communications networking  and digitally oriented consumer products like game consoles 
our c c segment products are also used in digital television  liquid crystal displays lcds  portable handheld devices and cellular phones  and are primarily used for dc dc converter type applications 
energy saving products esp the energy saving product segment is comprised of our power management ics  advanced circuit devices and power components primarily hexfet and igbt power components for variable speed motion control in energy saving appliances such as washing machines  refrigerators and air conditioners  industrial systems such as fans  pumps and compressors  advanced lighting products including fluorescent lamps  high intensity discharge hid lamps  cold cathode fluorescent ccfl tubes and light emitting diodes led lighting  advanced automotive solutions primarily diesel injection  electric gasoline hybrid and electric power steering systems  and consumer applications for example  plasma tvs and digital audio units 
aerospace and defense a d the aerospace and defense segment is comprised of advanced power management solutions  such as radiation hardened power management modules  radiation hardened power components  and other high reliability power components that address power management requirements in satellites  launch vehicles  aircrafts  ships  submarines and other defense and high reliability applications 
intellectual property ip the intellectual property segment reports our business of licensing our intellectual property to third parties 
our ip income has been and is largely dependent on the continued enforceability and validity of our licensed mosfet patents  which will generally reach their maturity in a few years 
aside from our mosfet technologies  our intellectual property strategy has been to use our intellectual property primarily for the design and development of value added families of products 
in our ip segment  we concentrate our efforts on the licensing of technologies or fields of use that have application beyond our product groups or which no longer align with our long term business strategies for our product groups 
we also target certain technologies for licensing that we believe help establish our product platforms and structures as industry standards and  thereby enhance the growth of certain products 
our non focus product segments are commodity products cp the commodity product segment is comprised primarily of older generation power components that are sold with margins generally below our strategic targets and are typically commodity in nature 
these products have widespread use throughout the power management products industry and are often complementary to many of our focus product offerings or allow us to provide a full range of customer or application offerings 
we often offer these products to take advantage of cross selling opportunities for our other product families 
these products may help to increase our manufacturing economies of scale 
non aligned products nap the non aligned product segment includes businesses  product lines or products we are targeting for realignment  whether by changing the business model for how we participate in the business  or by divestiture or other strategic transactions  such as joint venture or partnership 
we plan to support our non focus products to the extent we believe appropriate  to manage  maintain or increase their value in line with our long term goals for those segments 
currently  product lines reported in this segment are certain modules  rectifiers  diodes and thyristors used in automotive  industrial  welding and motor control applications 
industry overview power semiconductors convert power from an electrical outlet  a battery or an alternator running off an internal combustion engine into more efficient and useful power for a wide range of electrical and electronic systems and equipment 
the more sophisticated the end product  the greater the need for specially formatted  finely regulated power 
the importance of power semiconductor technology rises with the increasing complexity of electronic products and the proliferation of electronic features in information technology  industrial  consumer  aerospace and defense and automotive products 
according to isuppli  a leading industry source for market information  the market for power management semiconductors in calendar year was approximately billion  growing to approximately billion in calendar year our power management ics  advanced circuit devices  power components and power systems address approximately billion or over percent of this market 
we have seen signs of recovery from what we believe was an inventory correction during first half of calendar year however  economic conditions can be uncertain and difficult to predict 
historically  demand for power semiconductors has displayed cyclical characteristics 
current demand is driven largely by the following information technology it demand for increased speed and functionality 
product development roadmaps for the it industry call for continued increases in speed and functionality  and ever shrinking form factors driving power density in computers  servers  consumer electronics and a variety of leading edge electronic devices and equipment 
the need for greater power drives up current levels of processing and operating frequencies  and each new generation of it relies more heavily on  and places a higher value on  efficient  precise power management 
the development of wimax and the expected transition to more wideband technologies is requiring significant enhancements in power management technology 
as the worlds of computing  communications and consumer electronics converge  powerful devices and applications will emerge that will place increased data management requirements on servers  storage systems  routers and datacom equipment 
these changes will demand higher power performance levels 
consumer and industrial demand for energy efficiency 
worldwide demand for energy saving appliances  industrial motors  efficient lighting and consumer products like home entertainment displays and audio equipment continues to rise 
whether the end products are sold to customers in an industrialized nation with stringent environmental standards or a developing nation with a modest energy budget  advanced power management technology provides solutions to fulfill the need for energy efficient consumer and industrial products 
automotive demand for increased fuel economy 
current oil prices are driving consumer demand and regulatory mandates for increased automotive fuel efficiency 
in many instances the need for fuel efficiency is resulting in fundamental redesigns of automotive systems  where power features  such as electric power steering  common rail diesel injection and electric gasoline hybrid powertrain  are used to augment or replace traditional  less efficient systems 
the need to meet increased fuel efficiency is prompting a fundamental re design of automotive electrical systems  which is shaped in part by advancements in power management technology 
aerospace and defense demand for advanced power management technology 
in the aerospace and defense industries  power management technology is critical to meeting the rigorous space  weight and reliability requirements of highly demanding applications and harsh environments 
a renewed commitment to security drives some of the demand in this segment through growth in defense applications 
in addition  aircraft designs are converting from hydraulic control systems to electronic control systems  which use a higher content of power management products  and aerospace systems designers are constantly striving for higher efficiency power conversion solutions 
strategy we continue to build on our industry leadership in power management technology to develop certain key products based on our proprietary technology 
to differentiate ourselves  we focus on the power management requirements of a specific application and bring our comprehensive portfolio of products and technologies to advance the power management performance of that application 
our products are diversified within the power management field and serve various applications  such as computers  communications networking  consumer electronics  energy saving appliances  lighting  satellites  launch vehicles  aircraft and automotive diesel injection 
we continue our focus products strategy  which involves developing value added products  such as high performance power management ics  taking advantage of cross selling opportunities for our various product families  and increasing the number of new technical sales professionals and field application engineers worldwide 
we implement our strategy through the following initiatives adding value in high growth markets 
we concentrate our efforts on power management products and believe this focus has helped us develop the most advanced power management products and solutions 
for example  our power management ics are used in power management for portable electronics  next generation plasma hdtv displays and intel s and advanced micro devices most advanced microprocessors 
we are also targeting a wide range of applications that have not historically utilized power management technologies with our power management ics and power components  including washing machines  refrigerators  air conditioners and other appliances from such market leaders as electrolux  lg  samsung  sanyo and whirlpool 
leveraging our leading edge technology 
our leading edge technology enables us to set performance and architecture standards for power electronics in targeted applications 
our research and development program focuses on power management ics  advanced circuit devices and power systems and the advancement and diversification of our hexfet  power mosfet and igbt product lines 
during the three years ended june   we spent million on research and development 
we have a growing portfolio of approximately us patents and approximately patent applications pending worldwide see intellectual property below 
we continue to commit to research and development to generate new patents and other intellectual property and concentrate on incorporating our technologies into our focus products 
in the fiscal years ended june   and  licenses under our patents generated royalty income of million  million and million  respectively 
our licensed mosfet patents expire between and  with the broadest remaining in effect until and we now report our royalties from all intellectual property licensing under our ip segment 
our income has been and is largely dependent on the continued enforceability and validity of our licensed mosfet patents  which will be generally reaching their maturity in a few years 
our licensed mosfet patents expire between and  with the broadest remaining in effect until and aside from our mosfet technologies  our intellectual property strategy has been to use our intellectual property primarily for the design and development of a value added family of products 
in our ip segment  we concentrate our efforts on the licensing of technologies or fields of use that have application beyond our product groups or which no longer align with our long term business strategies for our product groups 
we also target certain technologies for licensing that we believe help establish our product platforms and structures as industry standards and  thereby  enhance the growth of certain products 
royalties from our mosfet patents have been and are largely dependent on the continued enforceability and validity of our licensed mosfet patents  the ability of our competitors to design around our licensed mosfet technology or to develop competing technologies and general market conditions 
the continuation of such royalties is subject to a number of risks see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition factors that may affect future results our ongoing protection and reliance on our intellectual property assets expose us to material risks 
extending leadership in power components 
we pioneered a fundamental technology for power mosfets and estimate that the majority of the world s power mosfets are produced by us or use our patented technology 
over the last two years  we invested aggressively to advance trench  planar and other process technologies 
these investments produced what we believe are the most efficient power mosfet components in the marketplace 
our leadership position in power components provides us with a platform for continued expansion in value added growth markets 
capitalizing on relationships with market leaders 
many industry leaders look to us for products and programs that address their most challenging power management needs 
these relationships put us at the forefront of developing products for new trends in the marketplace 
our strategy of driving significant content adoption with these customers into application specific areas requires a large  well trained technical sales team 
we have increased the number of technical product sales professionals and field application engineers worldwide  to offer technological design expertise and high quality customer service 
this comprehensive sales and engineering support includes design based consulting services  internet service applications  electronic order entry and just in time delivery 
focusing on manufacturing efficiency 
we fabricate most of our chips in facilities designed to address the specific requirements of power semiconductors 
we believe our wafer fabrication costs are among the lowest in the industry 
we have wafer fabrication and or assembly production facilities in california  massachusetts  mexico  the united kingdom  italy  india and china 
we also use third party foundries and assemblers that provides us with capacity flexibility 
we have been ramping up our most advanced manufacturing facility in newport  wales united kingdom  acquired in fiscal we expect this facility to support our growth over the next several years with first production wafers shipped in the fiscal quarter ended december  manufacturing related acquisition 
in july  we acquired the specialty silicon epitaxial services business from advanced technology materials  inc for million in cash in order to lower production costs and to gain certain key intellectual property for epitaxial silicon substrate manufacturing see note  acquisitions of notes to consolidated financial statements 
restructuring update 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we announced certain restructuring initiatives 
our goal was to position ourselves to better fit market conditions  de emphasize our commodity business and accelerate the move to our proprietary products  which refer to our power management ics  advanced circuit devices and power systems 
the restructuring plan included consolidating and closing several older facilities and legacy operations 
we also planned to lower overhead costs across our support organizations 
we have substantially completed these restructuring activities as of june  we expect to complete the remaining activities  primarily the closing of a fabrication line at el segundo  california and an assembly line at krefeld  germany by fiscal year end or sooner 
as of the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we have realized annualized savings of about million from our restructuring activities see also item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal impairment of assets  restructuring and severance charges 
focusing on divesting or changing our business model for lower margin product lines 
we review our business for product lines or products that we have determined in their current form or substance are not aligned with our long term strategic objectives  primarily for gross margin performance  and or for which our fundamental business model by which we derive value is changing 
in some instances we believe it is in our best interests to divest or discontinue the business 
in other instances  we may elect to participate in the business with a different structure  such as joint ventures and partnerships  to allow for long term business growth 
we have discontinued over million in annualized revenues since the beginning of fiscal year  across our various segments 
within our non focus products  specifically our non aligned product segment we have targeted an additional million for realignment  whether by changing the model for how we participate in the business  or by divestiture or other strategic transactions  such as joint venture or partnership 
we plan to support our non focus product segments to the extent we believe appropriate  to manage  maintain or increase their value in line with our long term goals for those segments 
refer to item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal and note to consolidated financial statements  segment and geographic information  for further discussions about our business segments 
products and applications our products process electrical power into a form that is more readily usable by electric products 
we believe that our full complement of power management technology represents a competitive advantage  enabling us to provide customers with solutions that shorten their overall product development cycle time 
our products are broadly divided among three product categories power management ics and advanced circuit devices  power components and power systems 
power management ics and advanced circuit devices our power management ics are semiconductors that often integrate several system functions including reference  logic  control  supervision  protection and monitoring on the same chip 
these devices optimize the performance of circuits that often include power mosfets and igbts and allow our customers to simplify circuit design and assembly  improve reliability  and reduce overall system size and cost 
the ability of these ics to sense and respond to circuit conditions makes their performance superior to discrete components 
our ics often use our proprietary power mosfet technology 
we have obtained substantial patent protection for our ics and have additional patent applications pending 
advanced circuit devices are chipsets  multi chip modules and other advanced performance devices that address power management requirements in demanding applications 
these products are value added or provided under reduced competition due to their technological content or our customer relationship 
increased complexity in computers  routers  servers and other devices require increased levels of power and more effective heat dissipation  making power management one of the most critical tasks 
it applications are trending to lower voltages and higher current levels  which require greater efficiency and more complex power management to meet speed and performance demands 
advanced consumer electronics such as pdp televisions and game consoles also require more efficient and complex power management 
motors consume approximately half of the world s electricity 
new variable speed motors equipped with our power management ics and advanced circuit devices increase energy efficiency and performance in a wide range of household  commercial and industrial applications 
for example  while most refrigerator motors can operate only at full speed  a refrigerator equipped with variable speed motor can run at the exact speed needed to maintain the required temperature 
our power management ics and advanced circuit devices designed for variable speed motors reduce electricity consumption  simplify product design  improve product performance and reduce overall costs 
we have achieved multiple sole source design wins from leading worldwide manufacturers in high end washing machines  refrigerators and other energy saving appliances 
we continue to invest aggressively in our power management ic technologies and key trench  planar and other process technologies 
these investments have resulted in what we believe are the most efficient power management ics and advance circuit devices 
among other attributes  we believe these product offerings set the industry standard for performance and cost efficiency in high volume consumer electronics applications 
power components switching products 
power mosfets and igbts rapidly and efficiently switch electricity on and off in order to supply power in a form that can be formatted to the specific requirements of a circuit 
through our hexfet product line  we are the market leader in power mosfets according to isuppli market research firm 
our emphasis on quality control and reliability has helped us maintain market acceptance and brand recognition of our hexfet line of products 
we pioneered the fundamental planar technology that set the industry standard for power mosfets 
mosfets are critical in a wide variety of electric products 
communications applications include cellular phones  telephone networks and modems 
computer and peripheral applications include power supplies  disk drives and printers 
office equipment applications include copiers and facsimile machines 
consumer electronics applications include home entertainment  video cameras  household appliances and power tools 
automobile applications include anti lock braking systems  fuel injection systems  power accessories and air bags 
industrial applications include automated production equipment  instrumentation and test equipment 
aerospace and defense applications include communications satellites and satellite command and control systems 
igbts typically perform the switch function in industrial applications that require higher current and voltage than power mosfets can handle efficiently 
the performance and ruggedness of these devices enable them to replace bipolar transistors and thyristors in many high voltage  high current motor control and power conditioning applications 
energy efficient  variable speed motor controls are an emerging application  and we believe hybrid and electric vehicles may require large quantities of igbts 
our igbt technology is closely related to our power mosfet technology 
we believe our patents on fundamental power mosfet technology also apply to igbts 
regulators  rectifiers  diodes  thyristors and interfaces 
we manufacture a broad line of regulators  rectifiers  diodes  thyristors and interfaces 
these products  which also condition electrical power to make it more efficient and usable  are used in industrial end products that require power handling capability from one amp to  amps and from volts to  volts 
applications include motor and lighting controls  welding equipment  forklifts  machine tools  induction heating  locomotives  motor driven production lines  smelting equipment and power supplies 
our schottky diodes and fast recovery diodes serve the output rectification function of power conversion 
a diode is a discrete device that conducts current in one direction 
a schottky diode is an ultra fast diode used in high frequency  low voltage circuits 
a fast recovery diode is a diode suited to applications above volts where high switching speed is desirable 
schottky diodes are used with power mosfets in high frequency applications such as computers and peripherals 
our hexfred fast recovery diodes are used with igbts in higher current  lower frequency applications such as motor controls 
power systems power systems combine power semiconductors with other power management components in specialized modules that improve power efficiency and simplify circuit design 
our power systems are used in dc dc converters  automotive electronics and motor control 
our products provide a cost effective alternative to custom analog designs 
tougher standards for fuel economy  emissions and safety and the proliferation of power features in automobiles are driving the adoption of more complex power electronics 
our power systems can help reconcile conflicting demands for better fuel mileage and more power features by replacing traditional hydraulic and belt driven applications with electronic systems 
in addition  electrically operated automotive systems improve reliability and maintenance 
our power systems are designed into integrated starter alternator motors  electric power steering systems  fuel pumps  water pumps and fan controls 
manufacturing semiconductor manufacturing involves two phases of production wafer fabrication and assembly 
wafer fabrication requires a sequence of process steps that expose silicon wafers to chemicals that change their electrical properties 
the chemicals are applied in patterns that define cells or circuits within numerous individual devices  termed die or chips  on each wafer 
assembly is the sequence of production steps that divide the wafer into individual chips and enclose the chips in structures  termed packages  which make them usable in a circuit 
power semiconductors generally use process technology and equipment already proven in the manufacturing of integrated circuits 
we have manufacturing and or assembly facilities in california  massachusetts  mexico  the united kingdom  italy  india and china 
in addition  we have equipment at  or manufacturing supply agreements with  subcontractors located in china  the czech republic  germany  korea  malaysia  philippines  taiwan  thailand and the united states 
we have substantially completed our restructuring activities previously announced in december  to de emphasize our commodity business and accelerate the move to our proprietary products  which refer to our power management ics  advanced circuit devices and power systems see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
as part of this strategy  we are consolidating and closing certain manufacturing sites  upgrading equipment and processes in designated facilities and discontinuing production in a number of others that cannot support more advance technology platforms or products within our focus product segments 
the majority of our capital spending were at our most advanced wafer fabrication facility  located in newport  wales 
this facility provides wafer fabrication capacity for mixed signal  analog and mosfet processes 
we have a mosfet wafer fabrication facility in temecula  california 
we have a high voltage power management ic wafer fabrication facility in el segundo  california  which is targeted to be moved to newport  wales by the end of fiscal year end assembly operations for products used in the aerospace and defense applications  which include high reliability power components  are located in leominster  massachusetts  santa clara  california  and tijuana  mexico 
we manufacture substantially all of our schottky diodes  high power rectifiers and thyristors at our torino  italy facility 
plants that assemble power mosfets and other products are located overseas in facilities we own or in subcontracted facilities 
our high volume assembly lines for power mosfets  igbts and diodes are located in our facility in tijuana  mexico 
we use production facilities in swansea  wales and krefeld  germany to manufacture and assemble automotive modules 
as part of our restructuring activities  we have moved most manufacturing activities from krefeld  germany to our swansea  wales and tijuana  mexico facilities 
in a duty free zone in india  we have an assembly facility for rectifiers and thyristors 
the mesa  arizona facility we acquired at the beginning of this fiscal year provides specialty silicon epitaxial services 
for our manufacturing facilities by reportable segment  refer to item  properties below 
at fiscal year ended june   we operated in the low s percent of our worldwide semiconductor fabrication and assembly module manufacturing capacities  without taking into account subcontract or foundry capacity 
demand for our focus products contributed to the high levels of capacity utilization 
in order to continue to meet the high demand for our focus products  we plan to accelerate our capital expansion plans 
as a consequence we anticipate nearly percent of fiscal year s capital expenditures will be in the first half of the year 
included in this plan is the ramp up of our mm wafer fabrication manufacturing facility in newport  wales facility 
this facility will provide our most advanced production capabilities 
we plan to utilize this fabrication capacity almost exclusively for focus products 
this facility offers us the much needed capacity over the next several years to support our growth 
we believe our fabrication costs are among the lowest in the industry 
through our focus products strategy  including our restructuring activities as described above  we have improved our gross margin to percent for the fiscal year ended june   from percent in the prior fiscal year 
focus products accounted for percent and percent of our consolidated revenues in fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively 
gross margin for our focus products increased to percent for the fiscal year ended june  from percent for the prior fiscal year ended june  marketing  sales and distribution we market our products through direct sales staff  representatives and distributors 
for our customers in our focus product segments  we primarily use direct sales staff and representatives 
in line with this strategy  we have added a complement of field application engineers and technical sales support staff to better serve the customers needs 
for customers in the commodity product segment  we primarily sell through distributors  taking advantage of cross selling opportunities with our other product families 
for the fiscal years ended june   and  direct sales to original equipment manufacturers oems were percent  percent and percent  respectively  of consolidated product sales  which exclude royalty income reported under our intellectual property segment 
for the fiscal year ended june   our product sales by region  based on the location of the customer  were percent from north america  percent from europe and percent from asia  which includes japan and asia pacific 
this has remained fairly consistent with the prior fiscal year ended june   where sales by region were percent  percent and percent for north america  europe and asia  respectively 
our domestic direct sales force is organized into five regional sales zones 
in europe  our products are sold through our own sales force as well as through independent sales agents and distributors 
our european sales and representative offices are in austria  the czech republic  denmark  finland  france  germany  hungary  italy  spain  sweden  switzerland  russia and the united kingdom 
in asia  we have sales representative or liaison offices in china  hong kong  india  japan  the philippines  singapore  south korea and taiwan 
we also have sales representative or liaison offices in australia  mexico and new zealand 
for financial information about the results for our geographic areas for each of the last three fiscal years  refer to note  segment and geographic information of notes to consolidated financial statements 
for the risks attendant to our foreign operations  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future results our international operations expose us to material risks 
because many applications require products from several product groups  we have organized our product development and marketing efforts by sector and application  rather than product type 
those general sectors are now reported within our defined segments 
in addition  our staff of application engineers provides customers with technical advice and support regarding the use of our products 
we have increased the number of engineering offices to help support our focus products 
we believe the depth of our power management product line enhances our competitive position in the overall power semiconductor market 
customers our devices are incorporated in subsystems and end products manufactured by other companies 
our customers include oems  distributors and subcontract manufacturers 
no single oem customer  distributor or subcontract manufacturer accounted for more than ten percent of our consolidated revenue for the fiscal year ended june  the majority of our products in our focus product segments  including those in the c c  esp and a d segments  are sold directly to oem customers 
however  three distributors included at the table below accounted for approximately percent of our c c revenues for the fiscal year ended june  one of these distributors accounted for approximately percent of our cp revenues for the fiscal year ended june  one of the oem customers included at the table below accounted for approximately percent of our nap revenues for the fiscal year ended june  no single oem customer  distributor or subcontract manufacturer accounted for more than ten percent of our other reported segments

we believe that we are differentiated from our competitors by our comprehensive line of power management products and our ability to combine these products into compact  cost effective packages and system level solutions 
our products compete with products manufactured by others on the basis of enabling capability  performance  reliability  quality  price  delivery time to customer and service including technical advice and support 
our major competitors in power management ics and advanced circuit devices include intersil  linear technology  maxim integrated products  semtech and texas instruments 
our major competitors in power components include fairchild semiconductor  infineon technologies  mitsubishi  on semiconductor  philips  renesas  stmicroelectronics  toshiba and vishay siliconix 
aside from typical industry competitors  our power systems products often offer our customers an improved alternative to their internal manufacturing systems internally 
our major competitors by business segment are as follows business segment competitors computing and communications fairchild semiconductor  infineon technologies  intersil  linear technology  maxim integrated products  national semiconductor  on semiconductor  philips  renesas  semtech  stmicroelectronics  texas instruments  vishay siliconix  and volterra energy saving products fairchild  infineon technologies  intersil  mitsubishi  national semiconductor  philips  renesas  stmicroelectronics  shindengen  texas instruments  toshiba and vishay siliconix aerospace and defense babcock  interpoint  microsemi  modular devices  ms kennedy  semelab  sensitron  vpt commodity products fairchild semiconductor  infineon technologies  matsushita  philips  renesas  stmicroelectronics  toshiba and vishay siliconix non aligned products mitsubishi  stmicroelectronics and toshiba backlog as of june   our backlog of orders was million compared to million as of june  the backlog for our c c and cp segments declined  which was partially offset by increase in backlog for our esp and a d segments 
backlog is comprised of purchase orders and customer forecast commitments scheduled to be shipped within the following twelve months 
increasingly  major customers are operating their businesses with shorter lead times and are placing their orders at shorter intervals  which tend to reduce backlog relative to future revenue 
given adequate notice  we usually allow customers to cancel purchase orders without penalty 
the amount of backlog to be shipped during any period is dependent on various factors and can vary significantly from month to month 
accordingly  backlog is not necessarily indicative of sales for any future period 
backlog by business segment as of fiscal years ended june  and is as follows in thousands computing and communications energy saving products aerospace and defense focus products backlog commodity products non aligned products non focus products backlog total backlog  june  research and development we conduct research and development activities to improve the performance and cost effectiveness of our product offerings in target applications 
our research and development program focuses on power management ics  advanced circuit devices and power systems and the advancement and diversification of our hexfet power mosfet and igbt product lines within our focus product segments 
our program places increasing emphasis on the development of chipsets and system level solutions that improve overall system performance and cost  and helps customers accelerate market introduction of their products 
in the fiscal years ended june   and  we spent million  million and million  respectively  on research and development activities 
we have increased our research and development spending by percent over the last five years  a period that included the steepest downturn in the history of the semiconductor industry 
our design centers are located throughout the world  including the united states  canada  the united kingdom  denmark  italy  france  germany and singapore 
during fiscal year  we continued to introduce advanced power management solutions that drive high performance computing and save energy across our served markets 
new products included a our pfc ic family of products helping computing  consumer electronics and home appliances meet energy efficiency standards  b an expansion of our imotion integrated design platform for energy saving appliances  c a series of high voltage igbt control ics with integrated protection features for a range of applications from motor drive to smps power supplies  d a broadening of our ipowir  directfet  and xphase families critical in high performance computing applications  e a universal active oring ic for redundant power systems common to telecommunications infrastructure  and f two new classes of radiation hardened mosfet platforms  r and r  and a family of efficient radiation hardened dc dc converter platforms for space applications 
intellectual property we continue to make significant investments in developing and protecting our intellectual property 
in the past fiscal year  we added over patents worldwide 
we have over issued unexpired us patents and approximately us patent applications pending including approximately provisional applications 
our power mosfet patents expire between and  with the broadest remaining in effect until and in addition  we have issued foreign patents and approximately foreign patent applications pending in a number of countries including applications filed under treaty 
we are also licensed to use certain patents owned by others 
we have several registered trademarks in the united states and abroad  including the trademark hexfet 
we believe that our intellectual property contributes to our competitive advantage 
we are committed to enforcing our patent rights  including litigation if necessary 
through successful enforcement of our patents over the past decade  we have entered into more than license agreements  generated royalty income  and received substantial payments in settlement of litigation 
our broadest power mosfet patents were subject to  and have successfully emerged from  reexamination by the united states patent and trademark office 
our ip segment reports our revenues from licensing our intellectual property to third parties 
we currently have license agreements with the majority of power mosfet manufacturers in the united states and abroad 
in the fiscal years ended june   and  we derived million  million and million of royalty revenues from license agreements  respectively 
our royalty income stream is dependent on the continued enforceability and validity of our patents  the ability of our competitors to design around our mosfet technology or develop competing technologies  and general market conditions 
the continuation of such royalties is subject to a number of risks see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition factors that may affect future results our ongoing protection and reliance on our intellectual property assets expose us to risks 
aside from our mosfet technologies  our intellectual property strategy has been to use our intellectual property primarily for the design and development of a value added family of products  and to defend those products in the marketplace 
in our ip segment  we concentrate our efforts on the licensing of technologies or fields of use that have application beyond our product groups or which no longer align with our long term business strategies for our product groups 
we also target certain technologies for licensing that we believe help establish our product platforms and structures as industry standards and  thereby  enhance the growth of certain products 
environmental matters federal  state and local laws and regulations impose various restrictions and controls on the storage  use and discharge of certain materials  chemicals and gases used in semiconductor manufacturing processes 
we do not believe that compliance with such laws and regulations as now in effect will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
however  under some of these laws and regulations  we could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if properties are contaminated or if waste is sent to a landfill or recycling facility that becomes contaminated 
also  we may be subject to common law claims if it releases substances that damage or harm third parties 
we cannot make assurances that changes in environmental laws and regulations will not require additional investments in capital equipment and the implementation of additional compliance programs in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows  as could any failure by us to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
ir and rachelle laboratories  inc rachelle  a former operating subsidiary of ours that discontinued operations in  were each named a potentially responsible party prp in connection with the investigation by the united states environmental protection agency epa of the disposal of allegedly hazardous substances at a major superfund site in monterey park  california oii site 
certain prps who settled certain claims with the epa under consent decrees filed suit in federal court in may against a number of other prps  including us  for cost recovery and contribution under the provisions of the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla 
we have settled all outstanding claims that have arisen against us out of the oii site 
no claims against rachelle have been settled 
we have taken the position that none of the wastes generated by rachelle were hazardous 
counsel for rachelle received a letter dated august from the us department of justice  directed to all or substantially all prps for the oii site  offering to settle claims against such parties for all work performed through and including the final remedy for the oii site 
the offer required a payment from rachelle in the amount of approximately million in order to take advantage of the settlement 
rachelle did not accept the offer 
it remains the position of rachelle that the wastes were not hazardous 
our insurer has not accepted liability  although it has made payments for defense costs for the lawsuit against us 
we have made no accrual for potential loss  if any  however  an adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows 
we received a letter in june from a law firm representing udt sensors  inc relating to environmental contamination chlorinated solvents such as trichlorethene assertedly found in udt s properties in hawthorne  california 
the letter alleges that we operated a manufacturing business at that location in the s and or s and that we may have liability in connection with the claimed contamination 
we have made no accrual for any potential losses since there has been no assertion of specific facts on which to form the basis for determination of liability 
employees as of august   we employed approximately  people  of whom approximately  were employed in north america   in europe and in asia pacific and japan 
the only collective bargaining agreements to which we are subject apply to our employees in italy 
we have approximately employees in italy 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good

at fiscal year ended june   we operated in the low s percent of our worldwide semiconductor fabrication and assembly module manufacturing capacities  without taking into account subcontract or foundry capacity 
demand for our focus products contributed to the high levels of capacity utilization 
in order to continue to meet the high demand for our focus products  we plan to accelerate our capital expansion plans 
as a consequence we anticipate nearly percent of capital expenditures for fiscal year will be in the first half of the year 
included in this plan is the ramp up of our mm wafer fabrication manufacturing facility in newport  wales that will provide our most advanced production capabilities 
we also plan to increase manufacturing efficiencies for our non focus product segments by consolidating certain facilities as part of our restructuring activities see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note  impairment of assets  restructuring and severance charges to consolidated financial statements

item legal proceedings in june  we filed suit in federal district court in los angeles  california against ixys corporation  alleging infringement of our key us patents   and  the suit sought damages and other relief customary in such matters 
the federal district court entered a permanent injunction  effective on june   barring ixys from making  using  offering to sell or selling in  or importing into the united states  mosfets including igbts covered by our us patents   and or  in august  the court of appeals for the federal circuit stayed that injunction  pending appeal on the merits 
in that same year  following trial on damages issues  a federal district court jury awarded us million in compensatory damages 
the federal district court subsequently tripled the damages  increasing the award from million to approximately million  and ruled that we are entitled to an additional award of reasonable attorney s fees for a total monetary judgment of about million 
in march  the us court of appeals for the federal circuit reversed the summary judgment granted to us by the federal district court in los angeles of infringement by ixys of our us patents   and  the federal circuit reversed in part and vacated in part infringement findings of the district court  granted ixys the right to present certain affirmative defenses  and vacated the injunction against ixys entered by the district court 
the ruling by the federal circuit had the effect of vacating the damages judgment obtained against ixys 
the federal circuit affirmed the district court s rulings in our favor regarding the validity and enforceability of the three ir patents 
following remand  a federal court jury in los angeles  california held on september   that ixys elongated octagonal mosfets and igbts infringed our  patent but did not infringe our  and  patents 
the jury will return on october  to hear our claim for damages for infringement of the  patent

for further information regarding our financial condition and results of operation  please read our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in its entirety  of which this is a part 
company and industry we are a leading designer  manufacturer and marketer of power management products using power semiconductors 
power semiconductors process electricity into a form more usable by electrical products 
our products address the two core challenges of power management  power performance and power conservation  by increasing system efficiency  allowing more compact end products  improving features and functionality  increasing fuel efficiency and extending battery life 
we focus on the power management requirements of specific applications and bring our comprehensive portfolio of products and technologies to better satisfy the needs of that application 
we concentrate on markets including computers  communications networking  consumer electronics  energy saving appliances  lighting  satellites  launch vehicles  aircraft and automotive diesel injection  where our comprehensive portfolio of technologies enable better  more competitive end products 
according to isuppli  a leading industry source of market information  the market for power management semiconductors in calendar year was approximately billion  growing to approximately billion in calendar year our power management ics  advanced circuit devices  power components and power systems address approximately billion or over percent of this market 
we have seen signs of recovery from what we believe was an inventory correction in the first half of calendar year however  overall economic conditions can be uncertain and difficult to predict 
we believe current demand for our products is driven largely by the following information technology demand for increased speed and functionality consumer and industrial demand for energy efficiency automotive demand for increased fuel economy aerospace and defense demand for advanced power management technology we divide our products among three general product categories power management ics and advanced circuit devices  power components and power systems 
we report our results in six segments that generally reflect the products end markets and our decision making for our company about allocating resources  including the focus of research and development activities  and in assessing performance 
we also generate revenues by licensing our intellectual property to third parties 
we summarize our segments into two groups  focus products and non focus products 
our focus product segments are computing and communications c c  energy saving products esp  aerospace and defense a d  and intellectual property ip 
our non focus product segments are commodity products cp and non aligned products nap 
to facilitate the comparison of current year segment results to that of prior years  segment disclosures for fiscal and have been restated to reflect these changes 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements  segment and geographic information for further details about our segments 
we market our products through direct sales staff  representatives and distributors 
our customers include original equipment manufacturers oems  distributors and subcontract manufacturers 
for our customers in our focus product segments  we primarily use direct sales staff and representatives 
in line with this strategy  we have added a complement of field application engineers and technical sales support staff to better serve the customers needs 
for customers in the commodity product segment  we primarily sell through distributors  taking advantage of cross selling opportunities with our other product families 
no single oem customer  distributor or subcontract manufacturer accounted for more than ten percent of our consolidated revenue for the fiscal year ended june  we conduct research and development activities to improve the performance and cost effectiveness of our product offerings in target applications 
our research and development program focuses on power management ics  advanced circuit devices and power systems and the advancement and diversification of our hexfet power mosfet and igbt product lines within our focus product segments 
our program places increasing emphasis on the development of chipsets and system level solutions that improve overall system performance and cost  and helps customers accelerate market introduction of their products 
in the fiscal years ended june   and  we spent million  million and million  respectively  on research and development activities 
we fabricate most of our chips in facilities designed to address the specific requirements of power semiconductors 
we believe our wafer fabrication costs are among the lowest in the industry 
we have wafer fabrication and or assembly production facilities in california  massachusetts  mexico  the united kingdom  italy  india and china 
we also use third party foundries and assemblers that provides us with capacity flexibility 
we have been ramping up our most advanced manufacturing facility in newport  wales united kingdom acquired in fiscal we plan to utilize this fabrication capacity almost exclusively for our focus products which offers us the much needed capacity over the next several years to support our growth 
overview of fiscal year results our revenues increased by percent to billion for the fiscal year ended june   compared to billion for the prior fiscal year ended june   reflecting the growth in sales of our focus products and the overall improved industry and economic conditions 
gross profit margin during the same period grew to percent of revenues for the fiscal year ended june   compared to percent in the prior year 
this improvement reflected the sale of a higher margin mix of our focus products  greater manufacturing efficiency from increased capacity utilization  and manufacturing cost savings across all segments 
the revenue increase from our focus product segments was partially offset by decrease from sales of our non focus product segments 
royalties contributed million to fiscal year revenues  compared to million in fiscal year revenues as a percentage of total product revenues based on sales location were approximately percent  percent and percent for north america  asia and europe  respectively  for the fiscal year ended june  revenues as a percentage of total product revenues were approximately percent  percent and percent for north america  asia and europe  respectively  for the fiscal year ended june  revenues from our focus product segments increased by percent to million for the fiscal year ended june  compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
these revenues comprised percent of total revenues for fiscal year  compared to percent for fiscal year gross margin for our focus product segments increased to percent for the fiscal year ended june   compared to percent in the prior fiscal year ended 
we refer to the products we sell within our focus product segments as our focus products 
revenues from our non focus product segments decreased by four percent to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross margin for our non focus product segments increased to percent for the fiscal year ended june   compared to percent in the prior fiscal year ended 
in our non focus product segments  the market for these low margin commodity products faced a serious inventory correction  sharply reduced lead times and increased price pressures during fiscal year however  the commodity market conditions appear to be improving and we expect the improvement to continue through fiscal year for the twelve months ended june   selling and administrative expense was million percent of revenues  compared to million percent of revenues in the twelve months ended june  for the twelve months ended june  and  research and development expense was million and million percent and percent of revenues  respectively 
as of fiscal year ended june   we have substantially completed our restructuring activities previously announced in calendar years and  which included reorganizing certain business units in the fourth quarter of fiscal  based on the products end markets or strategic application 
we are also continuing with our plan to review product lines and products not aligned with our long term objectives to increase our overall gross margins to over percent 
we have discontinued business opportunities of over million in annualized revenues since the beginning of fiscal year  across various segments 
within our non aligned product segment  we have targeted an additional million for realignment  whether by changing the model for how we participate in the business  or by divestiture or other transaction  such as a joint venture or strategic partnership 
we plan to support our non focus product segments to the extent we believe appropriate  in order to manage  maintain or increase their value in line with our long term goals for those segments 
refer to item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal and note to consolidated financial statements  segment and geographic information  for further discussions about our business segments 
as of fiscal year ended june   we operated in the low s percent of our worldwide semiconductor fabrication and assembly module manufacturing capacities  without taking into account subcontract or foundry capacity 
demand for our focus products contributed to the high levels of capacity utilization and we continue to invest significantly in our most advanced manufacturing facility in newport  wales  to provide additional capacity to support our focus products 
we advanced our capital expansion plans in the last quarter of the fiscal year  to address market conditions and capacity requirements for our focus products 
we invested strategically in our core technologies including acquiring the specialty epitaxial services business from advanced technology materials  inc at the beginning of fiscal year this acquisition enhances our ability to produce future generations of innovative power technologies 
we are committed to attracting and retaining the industry s best qualified technical  sales  marketing and managerial personnel 
with the issuance of fasb statement no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r that becomes effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal year  we will reduce the number of employees who will receive stock options 
we have established a new profit sharing plan to be in place for the new fiscal year  to offset the impact of the option grant reduction and offer eligible employees long term rewards 
for fiscal year  we anticipate that percent of our net income before the profit sharing plan expense will be paid to certain eligible employees 
in april  we accelerated the vesting of all then outstanding equity awards  including employee stock options and restricted stock units  in anticipation of the adoption of sfas no 
r 
we will avoid approximately million in future compensation expense associated with our equity awards  of which approximately million would have been in fiscal year refer to note to consolidated financial statements  capital stock for further details about our stock option plans 
at june   we had cash and cash equivalent balances of million and cash investments in marketable debt securities of million 
our cash  cash equivalents  cash investments in marketable debt securities and unused credit facilities of million  totaled billion

we have a growing portfolio of over us patents  approximately foreign patents and approximately applications pending worldwide 
in the past fiscal year  we added over approximately patents worldwide 
we expect royalties in fiscal year to be consistent with fiscal year commodity products the commodity product segment is comprised primarily of older generation power components that are sold with margins generally below our strategic targets and are typically commodity in nature 
these products have widespread use throughout the power management products industry and are often complementary to many of our focus products offerings or allow us to provide a full range of customer or application offerings 
we often offer these products to take advantage of cross selling opportunities for our other product families 
these products may help to increase our manufacturing economies of scale 
for the fiscal year ended june   revenues were million  down five percent from million in the fiscal year ended june   as we continued to discontinue certain low margin business opportunities in fiscal year gross margin for our cp segment improved to percent for the fiscal year ended june   from percent in the prior fiscal year  reflecting greater manufacturing efficiency from increased capacity utilization and restructuring cost savings

research and development expenditures increased reflecting continued development efforts on our focus products across our c c  esp and a d segments 
approximately percent of the fiscal year spending was related to new technology and product development for our focus products impairment of assets  restructuring and severance charges during fiscal second quarter ended december   we announced our restructuring initiatives 
under our restructuring initiatives  our goal was to reposition us to better fit the market conditions  de emphasize the commodity business and accelerate the move to what we categorize as our proprietary products  which refer to our power management ics  advanced circuit devices and power systems 
our restructuring plan included consolidating and closing certain manufacturing sites  upgrading equipment and processes in designated facilities and discontinuing production in a number of others that cannot support more advanced technology platforms or products 
we also planned to lower overhead costs across our support organizations 
we have substantially completed these restructuring activities as of june  we expect to complete the remaining activities  primarily the closing of a fabrication line at el segundo  california and an assembly line at krefeld  germany by fiscal year end or sooner 
we estimate that charges associated with the restructuring will be approximately million 
these charges will consist of approximately million for asset impairment  plant closure costs and other charges  million of raw material and work in process inventory  and approximately million for severance 
of the million in total charges  we expect cash charges to be approximately million 
for the fiscal year ended june   we realized savings of approximately million from the restructuring activities  with approximately percent of that savings affecting cost of goods sold 
for the fiscal year ended june   we recorded million in total restructuring related charges  consisting of million for asset impairment  plant closure costs and other charges and million for severance related costs 
for the fiscal year ended june   we recorded million in total restructuring related charges  consisting of million for asset impairment  plant closure costs and other charges and million for severance related costs 
restructuring related costs were measured in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
asset impairments were calculated in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in determining the asset groups  we grouped assets at the lowest level for which independent identifiable cash flows information was available 
in determining whether an asset was impaired we evaluated undiscounted future cash flows and other factors such as changes in strategy and technology 
the undiscounted cash flows from our initial analyses were less than the carrying amount for certain of the asset groups  indicating impairment losses 
based on this  we determined the fair value of these asset groups using the present value technique  by applying a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows that is consistent with the rate used when analyzing potential acquisitions 
as of june   we had recorded million in total charges  consisting of million for asset impairment  plant closure costs and other charges  million for raw material and work in process inventory charges  and million for severance related costs 
components of the million asset impairment  plant closure and other charges included the following items as we emphasize more advanced generation planar products  we expect the future revenue stream from our less advanced facilities in temecula  california to decrease significantly 
these facilities had a net book value of million and were written down by million 
it is expected that these facilities will continue in use until approximately december and the remaining basis is being depreciated over units of production during this period 
it is assumed that salvage value will equal disposition costs 
as we emphasize more advanced generation trench products  we expect the future revenue stream from our less advanced facility in el segundo  california to decrease significantly 
this facility had a net book value of million and was written down by million 
this facility had significantly reduced production as of fiscal year ended june   and is being used primarily for research and development activities 
as we emphasize more advanced generation schottky products  we expect the future revenue stream from our less advanced facility in borgaro  italy to decrease significantly 
this facility had a net book value of million and was written down by million 
it is expected that this facility will continue in use until approximately december and the remaining basis is being depreciated over units of production during this period 
it is assumed that salvage value will equal disposition costs 
we are restructuring our manufacturing activities in europe 
based on a review of our swansea  wales facility  a general purpose module facility  we determined that this facility would be better suited to focus only on automotive applications 
the general purpose assembly assets in this facility  with a net book value of million  were written down by million 
in addition  we have substantially completed the move of our manufacturing activities at our automotive facility in krefeld  germany to our swansea  wales and tijuana  mexico facilities as of june  we have also moved the production from our venaria  italy facility to our borgaro  italy and mumbia  india facilities  which was completed as of december  we stopped manufacturing activities in our oxted  england facility as of september  we have eliminated the manufacturing of our non space military products in our santa clara  california facility as of july  currently  subcontractors handle our non space qualified products formerly manufactured in this facility 
we are also transitioning the assembly and test of non space power components from our leominster  massachusetts facility to our tijuana  mexico facility  and expect to complete this activity by calendar year end associated with this reduction in manufacturing activities  certain assets with a net book value of million were written down by million 
million in other miscellaneous items were charged  including million in relocation costs and other impaired asset charges and million in contract termination and settlement costs 
as a result of the restructuring initiatives  certain raw material and work in process inventories were impaired  including products that could not be completed in other facilities  materials that were not compatible with the processes used in the alternative facilities  and materials such as gases and chemicals that could not readily be transferred 
based on these factors we wrote down these inventories  with a carrying value of million  by million 
for the fiscal years ended june   and  we had disposed of million  million and million  respectively  of these inventories  which did not have a material impact on gross margin for the fiscal years then ended 
as of june   million of these inventories remained to be disposed 
our restructuring activities are expected to result in severance charges of approximately million through june below is a table of approximate severance charges by major activity and location location activity amount el segundo  california close manufacturing facilities million santa clara  california and leominster  massachusetts eliminate certain manufacturing activities million oxted  england close manufacturing facility million veneria  italy move manufacturing to india and discontinue certain products million company wide realign business processes million total million to date  of the million noted above  we have recorded million in severance related charges million in severance termination costs related to approximately  administrative  operating and manufacturing positions  and million in pension termination costs at our manufacturing facility in oxted  england 
for the fiscal years ended june  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  in severance termination costs and and million  respectively  in pension termination costs 
the severance charges associated with the elimination of positions  which included the  persons notified to date  had been and will continue to be recognized ratably over the future service period  as applicable  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
we measured the total termination benefits at the communication date based on the fair value of the liability as of the termination date 
a change resulting from a revision to either the timing or the amount of estimated cash over the future service period will be measured using the credit adjusted risk free rate that was used to initially measure the liability 
the cumulative effect of the change will be recognized as an adjustment to the liability in the period of the change 
in fiscal  we had recorded an estimated million in severance costs associated with the acquisition of technofusion gmbh in krefeld  germany 
in fiscal  we finalized our plan and determined that total severance would be approximately million  and accordingly  we adjusted purchased goodwill by million 
we communicated the plan and the elimination of approximately positions primarily in manufacturing to its affected employees at that time 
the associated severance is expected be paid by calendar year end the following summarizes our severance accrued related to the june restructuring  the technofusion acquisition and the december restructuring plan for the fiscal years ended june   and severance activity related to the elimination of administrative and operating personnel as part of the previously reported restructuring in the fiscal quarter ended june   is also disclosed

we invested million in capital expenditures 
as of fiscal year ended june   we operated in the low s percent of our worldwide semiconductor fabrication and assembly module manufacturing capacities  without taking into account subcontract or foundry capacity 
demand for our focus products contributed to the high levels of capacity utilization and we continue to invest significantly in our most advanced manufacturing facility in newport  wales  to provide additional capacity to support our focus products 
we advanced our capital expansion plans in the last quarter of the fiscal year  to address market conditions and capacity requirements for our focus products 
as a consequence we anticipate that nearly percent of capital expenditures for fiscal year will be in the first half of the year

 and expect to substantially complete our analysis by the third quarter of fiscal year critical accounting estimates revenue recognition and allowances in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when the evidence of an arrangement exists  pricing is fixed and determinable  collection is reasonably assured  and delivery or performance of service has occurred 
we recognize the majority of revenues upon shipment for product sales to all customers  including distributors  with provisions for estimated returns and allowances recorded at the time of shipment 
certain customers have limited rights of returns and price protection programs 
we continuously monitor product returns and potential price adjustments and record a provision for these based on notification we receive of pending credits and historical experience 
while such credits have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same rate of returns and allowances 
if the historical data and estimates we used to calculate these provisions do not properly reflect future activity  our net sales  gross profit  net income and earnings per share could be impacted 
certain of our customers contracts contain substantive acceptance provisions 
in such circumstances  we recognize revenue in accordance with specific contract acceptance provisions  in most instances upon customer inspection or upon delivery of proof of conformance to customer specifications 
we also maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally first in  first out or market 
inventories are reviewed for excess and obsolescence based upon demand forecasts within a specific time horizon and reserves are established accordingly 
if actual market demand differs from our forecasts  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows may be materially impacted 
income taxes deferred income taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted rates in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income 
valuation allowances are established for the deferred tax assets for which we believe do not meet the more likely than not criteria established by sfas no 
judgments regarding future taxable income may be revised due to changes in market conditions  tax laws  or other factors 
if our assumptions and estimates change in the future  then the valuation allowances established may be increased  resulting in increased income tax expense 
conversely  if we are ultimately able to use all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been established  then the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to income tax expense 
income tax expense is the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we recognize certain tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit findings in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which additional taxes would be due  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
if the audit findings result in actual taxes owed more or less than what we had anticipated  our income tax expense would be increased or decreased  accordingly  in the period of the determination 
us income taxes have not been provided on approximately million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries since we consider these earnings to be invested indefinitely or offset by foreign tax credits 
it is not practical to estimate the amount of unrecognized deferred us taxes on these undistributed earnings 
loss contingencies the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty 
sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  requires that we provide an allowance for the estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim  if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
sfas no 
requires that we disclose material loss contingency if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued  we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and whether we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to assess whether such accruals should be adjusted 
if the actual outcome of the legal proceeding or claim differs from our assessment  our financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially impacted 
statement of caution under the private securities litigation reform act of this annual report on form k includes some statements and other information that are not historical facts but are forward looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of the materials presented can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  may  should  view  or will or the negative or other variations thereof 
we caution that such statements are subject to a number of uncertainties  and actual results may differ materially 
factors that could affect our actual results include those set forth below under factors that may affect future results and other uncertainties disclosed in our reports filed from time to time with the securities and exchange commission 
unless required by law  we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements to reflect new information  future events or otherwise 
factors that may affect future results downturns in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry or changes in end market demand could affect our operating results and the value of our business 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and the value of our business may decline during the down portion of these cycles 
we have experienced these conditions in our business in the recent past and we cannot predict when we may experience such downturns in the future 
future downturns in the semiconductor industry  or any failure of the industry to recover fully from its recent downturns could seriously impact our revenues and harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although markets for our semiconductors appear stable  we cannot assure you that they will continue to be stable or that our markets will not experience renewed  possibly more severe and prolonged  downturns in the future 
in addition  we may experience significant changes in our profitability as a result of variations in sales  seasonality  changes in product mix  price competition for orders and the costs associated with the introduction of new products and start up of new facilities 
the markets for our products depend on continued demand in the information technology  consumer  industrial  aerospace and defense and automotive markets  and these end markets may experience changes in demand that could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
consumer and or corporate spending for the end market applications which incorporate our products may be reduced due to increased oil prices or otherwise 
our revenues and gross margin guidance is dependent on certain level of consumer and or corporate spending 
if our projections of these expenditures fail to materialize  due to reduced consumer or corporate spending from increased oil prices or otherwise  our revenues and gross margin could be adversely impacted 
we maintain backlog of customer orders that is subject to cancellation  reduction or delay in delivery schedules  which may result in lower than expected revenues 
with certain exceptions related to products within our aerospace and defense and non aligned product segments  we manufacture primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or to forecast  rather than pursuant to long term supply contracts 
the semiconductor industry is subject to rapid changes in customer outlooks or unexpected build ups of inventory in the supply channel as a result of shifts in end market demand 
accordingly  many of these purchase orders or forecasts may be revised or canceled without penalty 
as a result  we must commit resources to the manufacturing of products without any advance purchase commitments from customers 
our inability to sell products after we devote significant resources to them could have a material adverse effect on both our levels of inventory and revenues 
the semiconductor business is highly competitive and increased competition could reduce the value of an investment in our company 
the semiconductor industry  including the sector in which we do business  is highly competitive 
competition is based on price  product performance  product availability  quality  reliability and customer service 
price pressures may emerge as competitors attempt to gain a greater market share by lowering prices 
we compete in various markets with companies of various sizes  many of which are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we have  and thus they may be better able to pursue acquisition candidates and to withstand adverse economic or market conditions 
in addition  companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future 
if we are unable to implement our business strategy  our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 
our future financial performance and success are largely dependent on our ability to implement our business strategy successfully of transforming our business to one led by our focus products and succeeding on our plans to restructure our company 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to successfully implement our business strategy or that implementing our strategy will sustain or improve our results of operations 
the failure to execute on our plans to divest or discontinue that are not consistent with our business objectives  and replace those revenues with higher margin product sales could adversely affect our operating results 
we have announced the divestiture  discontinuation or change in business model of certain of our non focus products that are not consistent with our business objectives or margin targets 
our plan is to replace the divested or discontinued revenues with or change the business model to achieve higher margin product sales and target gross margin of greater percent 
we cannot assure you that we will complete our plans or achieve our target gross margin 
the activities involved with the divestiture  discontinuation and re alignment of product sales could involve changes to various aspects of our business which could adversely affect our profitability to an extent we have not anticipated 
even if we fully execute and implement our plans  there may be unforeseen factors that could adversely impact our operating results 
the failure to implement  as well as the completion and impact of our restructuring programs and cost reductions could adversely affect our business 
in december  we announced a number of restructuring initiatives 
our goal was to reposition our company to better fit the market conditions  de emphasize our commodity business and accelerate the move to what we categorize as our proprietary products  which refer to our power management ics  advanced circuit devices  and power systems 
the restructuring includes consolidating and closing certain manufacturing sites  upgrading equipment and processes in designated facilities and discontinuing production in a number of others that cannot support more advanced technology platforms or products 
the restructuring also includes lowering overhead costs across our support organization 
we cannot assure you that these restructuring initiatives will achieve their goals  accomplish the cost reductions planned or be accomplished within our expectations as to the amount of charges to be taken in connection with that activity 
additionally  because our restructuring activities involve changes to many aspects of our business  the costs reductions could adversely affect productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated 
even if we fully execute and implement these restructuring activities  and they generate the anticipated cost savings  there may be other unforeseen factors that could result in the amount of charges to be taken in connection with our restructuring activities or otherwise adversely impact our profitability and business 
failure to timely complete our expansion plans for our wafer fabrication facility could adversely affect our revenue growth and ability to achieve our margin targets 
we have announced that we are operating in the low s percent of our worldwide semiconductor fabrication and assembly module manufacturing capacities  without taking into account subcontract or foundry capacity  and that we are advancing our expansion plans for our most advanced wafer fabrication facility in newport  wales to provide additional capacity to support our growth of our focus products 
if we fail to timely execute on those plans in advance of demand for our products  that failure could adversely affect our revenue growth and ability to achieve our margin targets 
we cannot assure you that we will complete our plans timely  that the ramp up of the expanded facilities will occur effectively and without error or delay  or that sufficient third party sources would be available to satisfy our ability to meet customer demand 
even if we fully execute and implement our plans  there may be unforeseen factors that could adversely impact our operating results 
delays in initiation of production at new facilities  implementing new production techniques or resolving problems associated with technical equipment malfunctions could adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies 
our manufacturing efficiency has been and will be an important factor in our future profitability  and we may not be able to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency 
our manufacturing and testing processes are complex  require advanced and costly equipment and are continually being modified in our efforts to improve yields and product performance 
difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields 
technical or other problems could lead to production delays  order cancellations and lost revenue 
in addition  any problems in achieving acceptable yields  construction delays  or other problems in upgrading or expanding existing facilities  building new facilities  problems in bringing other new manufacturing capacity to full production or changing our process technologies  could also result in capacity constraints  production delays and a loss of future revenues and customers 
our operating results also could be adversely affected by any increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if net sales do not increase proportionately  or in the event of a decline in demand for our products 
if some original equipment manufacturers oems do not design our products into their equipment  a portion of our revenue may be adversely affected 
a design win from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer 
we may be unable to achieve these design wins 
without design wins from oems  we would only be able to sell our products to these oems as a second source  if at all 
once an oem designs another supplier s semiconductor into one of its product platforms  it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that oem s product platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost  time  effort and risk 
achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive is significant revenue from that customer and we may be unable to convert design into actual sales 
corporate investment and expenditures in the information technology sector and in information technology purchases may not materialize as we have planned 
our revenues and gross margin guidance is dependent on a certain level of corporate investment and expenditures in the information technology sector and in information technology purchases 
if our projections of these expenditures fail to materialize whether due to increased oil prices or otherwise  our revenues and gross margin could be adversely impacted 
new technologies could result in the development of new products and a decrease in demand for our products  and we may not be able to develop new products to satisfy changes in demand 
our failure to develop new technologies or react to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development of new products  which could result in decreased revenues and a loss of market share to our competitors 
rapidly changing technologies and industry standards  along with frequent new product introductions  characterize the semiconductor industry 
as a result  we must devote significant resources to research and development 
our financial performance depends on our ability to design  develop  manufacture  assemble  test  market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and cost effective manner  or that products or technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
a fundamental shift in technologies in our product markets could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within the industry 
in addition  to remain competitive  we must continue to reduce die sizes and improve manufacturing yields 
we cannot assure you that we can accomplish these goals 
our failure to obtain or maintain the right to use certain technologies may negatively affect our financial results 
our future success and competitive position may depend in part upon our ability to obtain or maintain certain proprietary technologies used in our principal products  which is achieved in part by defending and maintaining the validity of our patents and defending claims by our competitors of intellectual property infringement 
we license certain patents owned by others 
we have also been notified that certain of our products may infringe the patents of third parties 
although licenses are generally offered in such situations  we cannot eliminate the risk of litigation alleging patent infringement 
we are currently a defendant in intellectual property claims and we could become subject to other lawsuits in which it is alleged that we have infringed upon the intellectual property rights of others 
our involvement in existing and future intellectual property litigation could result in significant expense  adversely affect sales of the challenged product or technologies and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor 
if any such infringements exist  arise or are claimed in the future  we may be exposed to substantial liability for damages and may need to obtain licenses from the patent owners  discontinue or change our processes or products or expend significant resources to develop or acquire non infringing technologies 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in such efforts or that such licenses would be available under reasonable terms 
our failure to develop or acquire non infringing technologies or to obtain licenses on acceptable terms or the occurrence of related litigation itself could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
our ongoing protection and reliance on our intellectual property assets expose us to risks 
we have traditionally relied on our patents and proprietary technologies 
patent litigation settlements and royalty income substantially contribute to our financial results 
enforcement of our intellectual property rights is costly  risky and time consuming 
we cannot assure you that we can successfully continue to protect our intellectual property rights  especially in foreign markets 
our key mosfet patents expire between and  although our broadest mosfet patents expire in and our royalty income is largely dependent on the following factors the remaining terms of our mosfet patents  the continuing introduction and acceptance of products that are not covered by our patents  remaining covered under unexpired mosfet patents  the defensibility and enforceability of our patents  changes in our licensees unit sales  prices or die sizes  and the terms  if any  upon which expiring license agreements are renegotiated 
market conditions and mix of licensee products  as well as sales of non infringing devices can significantly affect royalty income 
as a consequence  we cannot guarantee that our royalty income will continue at levels consistent with prior periods 
any decrease in our royalty income could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
our international operations expose us to material risks 
we expect revenues from foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of total revenues 
we maintain or contract with significant operations in foreign countries 
among others  the following risks are inherent in doing business internationally changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  including tax laws in the united states and in the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products  trade restrictions  transportation delays  work stoppages  economic and political instability  and foreign currency fluctuations 
in addition  certain of our operations and products are subject to restrictions or licensing under us export laws 
if such laws or the implementation of these restrictions change  or if in the course of operating under such laws we become subject to claims  we cannot assure you that such factors would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
in addition  it is more difficult in some foreign countries to protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as is possible in the united states 
therefore  the risk of piracy or misuse of our technology and products may be greater in these foreign countries 
although we have not experienced any material adverse effect on our operating results as a result of these and other factors  we cannot assure you that such factors will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results in the future 
delays in initiation of production at new facilities  implementing new production techniques or resolving problems associated with technical equipment malfunctions could adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies 
our manufacturing efficiency will be an important factor in our future profitability  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors 
our manufacturing processes are highly complex  require advanced and costly equipment and are continuously being modified in an effort to improve yields and product performance 
impurities  defects or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields 
in addition  as is common in the semiconductor industry  we have from time to time experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities or in effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes 
as a consequence  we have experienced delays in product deliveries and reduced yields 
we may experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of  among other things  capacity constraints  construction delays  upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing our process technologies  any of which could result in a loss of future revenues 
our operating results could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately 
we are transferring manufacturing from our krefeld  germany to our swansea  wales and tijuana  mexico facilities 
we are ramping up our newport  wales facility  and anticipate to transfer our el segundo manufacturing to the newport  wales facility by fiscal year end june we have experienced some delays and or technical problems in moving our various facilities 
continued delays and or technical problems in completing the remaining transfers could lead to increased costs  reduced yields  delays in product deliveries  order cancellations and or lost revenue 
interruptions  delays or cost increases affecting our materials  parts or equipment may impair our competitive position and our operations 
our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of materials  parts and equipment  including silicon  mold compounds and leadframes  on a timely basis from third parties 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain adequate supplies of materials  parts and equipment in a timely manner or if the costs of materials  parts or equipment increase significantly 
from time to time  suppliers may extend lead times  limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 
we have a limited number of suppliers for some materials  parts and equipment  and any interruption could materially impair our operations 
we manufacture a substantial portion of our wafer product at our temecula  california and newport  wales facilities 
any disruption of operations at those facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
also  some of our products are assembled and tested by third party subcontractors 
we do not have any long term assembly agreements with these subcontractors 
as a result  we do not have immediate control over our product delivery schedules or product quality 
due to the amount of time often required to qualify assemblers and testers and the high cost of qualifying multiple parties for the same products  we could experience delays in the shipment of our products if we are forced to find alternative third parties to assemble or test them 
any product delivery delays in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
our operations and ability to satisfy customer obligations could be adversely affected if our relationships with these subcontractors were disrupted or terminated 
we must commit resources to product manufacturing prior to receipt of purchase commitments and could lose some or all of the associated investment 
we sell products primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or to forecast  rather than pursuant to long term supply contracts 
many of these purchase orders or forecasts may be revised or canceled without penalty 
as a result  we must commit resources to the manufacturing of products without any advance purchase commitments from customers 
our inability to sell products after we devote significant resources to them could have a material adverse effect on our levels of inventory and our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we receive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and distributors 
historically  a significant portion of our revenues has come from a relatively small number of customers and distributors 
the loss or financial failure of any significant customer or distributor  any reduction in orders by any of our significant customers or distributors  or the cancellation of a significant order  could materially and adversely affect our business 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting  we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or detect fraud  which could harm our business and the trading price of our stock 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important in our effort to prevent financial fraud 
we are required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls 
these evaluations may result in the conclusion that enhancements  modifications or changes to our internal controls are necessary or desirable 
while management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on a regular basis  we cannot provide absolute assurance that these controls will always be effective 
there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls including collusion  management override  and failure of human judgment 
because of this  control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or if management or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weakness in our internal controls  we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud and it could harm our financial condition and results of operations and result in loss of investor confidence and a decline in our stock price 
if oems do not design our products into their equipment  a portion of our revenue may be adversely affected 
a design win from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer 
we may be unable to achieve these design wins 
without design wins from oems  we would only be able to sell our products to these oems as a second source 
once an oem designs another supplier s semiconductors into one of its product platforms  it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that oem s product platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost  time  effort and risk 
achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive is significant revenues from that customer and we may be unable to convert design into actual sales 
even after a design win  the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to stop using our product  if  for example  its own products are not commercially successful 
we may fail to attract or retain the qualified technical  sales  marketing and managerial personnel required to operate our business successfully 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  sales  marketing and managerial personnel 
personnel with the necessary semiconductor expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain existing key technical  sales  marketing and managerial employees or that we will be successful in attracting  assimilating or retaining other highly qualified technical  sales  marketing and managerial personnel in the future 
if we are unable to retain existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we are acquiring and may continue to acquire other companies and may be unable to successfully integrate such companies with our operations 
we have acquired several companies over the past three years 
we may continue to expand and diversify our operations with additional acquisitions 
if we are unsuccessful in integrating these companies with our operations  or if integration is more difficult than anticipated  we may experience disruptions that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and may fluctuate widely in the future 
our common stock  which is traded on the new york stock exchange  has experienced and may continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations that could adversely affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance 
in addition  we believe that factors such as quarterly fluctuations in financial results  earnings below analysts estimates and financial performance and other activities of other publicly traded companies in the semiconductor industry could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  in recent periods  our common stock  the stock market in general and the market for shares of semiconductor industry related stocks in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
any similar fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our investments in certain securities expose us to market risks 
we invest excess cash in marketable securities consisting primarily of commercial paper  corporate notes  corporate bonds and governmental securities 
we also hold as strategic investments the common stock of two publicly traded japanese companies  one of which is nihon inter electronics corporation 
the value of these investments is subject to market fluctuations  which if adverse  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
our products may be found to be defective and  as a result  product liability claims may be asserted against us which may harm our business and our reputation with our customers 
our products are typically sold at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated 
although we maintain rigorous quality control systems  we shipped individual semiconductor devices in to customers around the world  and in the ordinary course of our business we receive warranty claims for some of these products that are defective  or that do not perform to published specifications 
since a defect or failure in our products could give rise to failures in the end products that incorporate them and consequential claims for damages against our customers from their customers depending on applicable law and contract  we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits we receive from the products involved 
in addition  our ability to reduce such liabilities may be limited by the laws or the customary business practices of the countries where we do business 
even in cases where we do not believe we have legal liability for such claims  we may choose to pay for them to retain a customer s business or goodwill or to settle claims to avoid protracted litigation 
our results of operations and business could be adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issue in our products  if we are required to choose to pay for the damages that result 
although we currently have product liability insurance  we may not have sufficient insurance coverage  and we may not have sufficient resources  to satisfy all possible product liability claims 
in addition  any perception that our products are defective would likely result in reduced sales of our products  loss of customers and harm to our business and reputation 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting  we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or detect fraud  which could harm our business and the trading price of our stock 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important in our effort to prevent financial fraud 
we are required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls 
these evaluations may result in the conclusion that enhancements  modifications or changes to our internal controls are necessary or desirable 
while management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on a regular basis  we cannot provide absolute assurance that these controls will always be effective 
there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls including collusion  management override  and failure of human judgment 
because of this  control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or if management or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls  we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud and it could harm our financial condition and results of operations and result in loss of investor confidence and a decline in our stock price 
large potential environmental liabilities  including those relating to a former operating subsidiary  may adversely impact our financial position 
federal  state  foreign and local laws and regulations impose various restrictions and controls on the discharge of materials  chemicals and gases used in our semiconductor manufacturing processes 
in addition  under some laws and regulations  we could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if our properties are contaminated or if we send waste to a landfill or recycling facility that becomes contaminated  even if we did not cause the contamination 
also  we may be subject to common law claims if we release substances that damage or harm third parties 
further  we cannot assure you that changes in environmental laws or regulations will not require additional investments in capital equipment or the implementation of additional compliance programs in the future 
any failure to comply with environmental laws or regulations could subject us to serious liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
some of our facilities are located near major earthquake fault lines 
our corporate headquarters  one of our manufacturing facility  one of our research facility and certain other critical business operations are located near major earthquake fault lines 
we could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake 
although we maintain earthquake insurance  we can give you no assurance that we have obtained or will maintain sufficient insurance coverage 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient capital resources to make necessary investments in manufacturing technology and equipment 
the semiconductor industry is capital intensive 
semiconductor manufacturing requires a constant upgrading of process technology to remain competitive  as new and enhanced semiconductor processes are developed which permit smaller  more efficient and more powerful semiconductor devices 
we maintain certain of our own manufacturing  assembly and test facilities  which have required and will continue to require significant investments in manufacturing technology and equipment 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient capital resources to make necessary investments in manufacturing technology and equipment 
although we believe that anticipated cash flows from operations  existing cash reserves and other equity or debt financings that we may obtain will be sufficient to satisfy our future capital expenditure requirements  there can be no assurance that this will be the case or that alternative sources of capital will be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
unforeseen changes in market conditions  tax laws and other factors could impact our judgment about the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
we have made certain judgments regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the carrying value of the net deferred tax assets is based on the belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets  after considering all available positive and negative evidence 
if our assumptions and estimates change in the future given unforeseen changes in market conditions  tax laws or other factors  then the valuation allowances established may be increased  resulting in increased income tax expense 
conversely  if we are ultimately able to use all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been established  then the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to income tax expense 
final outcomes from the various tax authorities audits are difficult to predict and an unfavorable finding may negatively impact our financial results 
as is common with corporations of our size  we are from time to time under audit by various taxing authorities 
it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter 
we have provided certain tax reserves which have been included in the determination of our financial results 
however  unpredicted unfavorable settlement may require additional use of cash and negatively impact our financial position or results of operations 
terrorist attacks  such as those that took place on september   or threats or occurrences of other terrorist activities whether in the united states or internationally may affect the markets in which our common stock trades  the markets in which we operate and our profitability 
terrorist attacks  such as those that took place on september   or threats or occurrences of other terrorist or related activities  whether in the united states or internationally  may affect the markets in which our common stock trades  the markets in which we operate and our profitability 
future terrorist or related activities could affect our domestic and international sales  disrupt our supply chains and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products 
such activities could affect our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers  and make transportation of our supplies and products more difficult or cost prohibitive 
due to the broad and uncertain effects that terrorist attacks have had on financial and economic markets generally  we cannot provide any estimate of how these activities might affect our future results 
natural disasters  like those related to hurricane katrina  or occurrences of other natural disasters whether in the united states or internationally may affect the markets in which our common stock trades  the markets in which we operate and our profitability 
moreover  natural disasters  like those related to hurricane katrina  or threats or occurrences of other similar events  whether in the united states or internationally  may affect the markets in which our common stock trades  the markets in which we operate and our profitability 
such events could affect our domestic and international sales  disrupt our supply chains  primarily for raw materials and process chemicals and gases  and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products 
while we do not have facilities located near the affected areas  such activities could affect physical facilities of our suppliers or customers  and make transportation of our supplies and products more difficult or cost prohibitive 
due to the broad and uncertain effects that natural events have had on financial and economic markets generally  we cannot provide any estimate of how these activities might affect our future results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various risks  including fluctuations in interest and foreign currency rates 
in the normal course of business  we also face risks that are either non financial or non quantifiable 
such risks principally include country risk  credit risk and legal risk and are not discussed or quantified in the following analyses  as well as risks set forth under the heading factors that may affect future results 
interest rate risk our financial assets and liabilities subject to interest rate risk are cash investments  convertible debt  credit facilities and interest rate swaps 
our primary objective is to preserve principal while maximizing net investment yield without significantly increasing risk 
at june   we evaluated the effect that near term changes in interest rates would have had on these transactions 
a change of as much as ten percent in the london interbank offered rate libor would have had an annualized favorable impact of approximately million on net interest income expense since the interest income on our cash and cash investments would have outweighed additional interest expense on our outstanding debt 
for our interest rate contract with lehman brothers  an increase of ten percent in interest rates would have had a favorable impact of million  and a decrease of ten percent in interest rates would have had an adverse impact of million  on net interest income expense 
these changes would not have had a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december  we entered into an interest rate swap transaction the transaction with jp morgan chase bank the bank  to modify our effective interest payable with respect to million of our million outstanding convertible debt the debt see notes  derivative financial instruments  and  bank loans and long term debt 
at the inception of the transaction  interest rates were lower than that of the debt and we believed that interest rates would remain lower for an extended period of time 
in april  we entered into an interest rate swap transaction the april transaction with the bank to modify the effective interest payable with respect to the remaining million of the debt 
the variable interest rate we have paid since the inception of the swap has averaged percent  compared to a coupon of percent on the debt 
during the fiscal years ended june   and  these arrangements reduced interest expense by million  million and million  respectively 
accounted for as fair value hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the mark to market adjustments of the two transactions were offset by the mark to market adjustments on the debt  resulting in no material impact to earnings 
to measure the effectiveness of the hedge relationship  we use a regression analysis 
to evaluate the relationship of the fair value of the transaction and the changes in fair value of the debt attributable to changes in the benchmark rate  we discount the estimated cash flows by the libor swap rate that corresponds to the debt s expected maturity date 
in addition  our ability to call the debt was considered in assessing the effectiveness of the hedging relationship 
for those years that were projected to include at least a portion of redemption of the convertible debentures  we employed a valuation model known as a monte carlo simulation 
this simulation allows us to project probability weighted contractual cash flows discounted at the libor swap rate that corresponded to the debt s expected maturity date 
the market value of the december transaction was a million liability and a million asset at june  and  respectively 
the market value of the april transaction was a million liability and a million liability at june  and  respectively 
in april  we entered into an interest rate contract the contract with an investment bank  lehman brothers lehman  to reduce the variable interest rate risk of the transaction 
the notional amount of the contract is million  representing approximately percent of the debt 
under the terms of the contract  we have the option to receive a payout from lehman covering our exposure to libor fluctuations between percent and percent for any four designated quarters 
the market value of the contract at june  and  was million and million  respectively  and was included in other long term assets 
interest expense was increased by mark to market losses of million  million and million  for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
foreign currency risk we conduct business on a global basis in several foreign currencies  and at various times  we have currency exposure related to the british pound sterling  the euro and the japanese yen 
our risk to the european currencies is partially offset by the natural hedge of manufacturing and selling goods in both us dollars and the european currencies 
considering our specific foreign currency exposures  we have the greatest exposure to the japanese yen  since we have significant yen based revenues without the yen based manufacturing costs 
we have established a foreign currency hedging program using foreign exchange forward contracts  including the forward contract described below  to hedge certain foreign currency transaction exposures 
to protect against reductions in value and volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates  we have established revenue  expense and balance sheet hedging programs 
currency forward contracts and local yen and euro borrowings are used in these hedging programs 
our hedging programs reduce  but do not always eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
we considered an adverse near term change in exchange rates of ten percent for the british pound sterling  the euro and the japanese yen 
such an adverse change  after taking into account our derivative financial instruments and offsetting positions  would have resulted in an annualized adverse impact on income before taxes of less than million for the fiscal years ended june   and in march  we entered into a five year foreign exchange forward contract the forward contract for the purpose of reducing the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on forecasted intercompany purchases by our subsidiary in japan 
we have designated the forward contract as a cash flow hedge under which mark to market adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of stockholders equity  until the forecasted transactions are recorded in earnings 
under the terms of the forward contract  we are required to exchange billion yen for million on a quarterly basis from june to march at june   three quarterly payments of billion yen remained to be swapped at a forward exchange rate of yen per us dollar 
the market value of the forward contract was a million asset and a million liability at june  and  respectively 
the mark to market gains losses  net of tax  of million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  was included in other comprehensive income 
based on effectiveness tests comparing forecasted transactions through the forward contract expiration date to its cash flow requirements  we do not expect to incur a material charge to income during the next twelve months as a result of the forward contract 
we had approximately million and million in notional amounts of forward contracts which were not designated as accounting hedges under sfas no 
at june  and  respectively 
net realized and unrealized foreign currency gains recognized in earnings were million for the fiscal year ended june  and less than million for the fiscal years ended june   and
