table of contents funding  the population base in the state  the willingness of the physician provider community to participate with the americhoice personal care model and the presence of community based organizations americhoice can work with to meets the needs of individuals

government regulation most of our health and well being services are regulated 
this regulation can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
federal and state regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules 
changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered  and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically 
federal regulation our health care services segment  which includes unitedhealthcare  ovations  and americhoice  is subject to federal regulation 
ovations has medicare advantage contracts that are regulated by cms 
cms has the right to audit performance to determine compliance with cms contracts and regulations and the quality of care being given to members 
our health care services segment also has medicaid and state children s health insurance program contracts that are subject to federal and state regulations regarding services to be provided to medicaid enrollees  payment for those services  and other aspects of these programs 
there are many regulations surrounding medicare and medicaid compliance 
in addition  because a portion of ingenix s business includes clinical research  it is subject to regulation by the fda 
we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with the applicable laws and regulations 

table of contents state regulation all of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and health maintenance products regulate those products and operations 
these states require periodic financial reports and establish minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements 
health plans and insurance companies are regulated under state insurance holding company regulations 
such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports that describe capital structure  ownership  financial condition  certain inter company transactions and general business operations 
some state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material inter company transfers of assets  as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates 
in addition  some of our business and related activities may be subject to preferred provider organization ppo  managed care organization mco or tpa related regulations and licensure requirements 
these regulations differ from state to state  but generally contain network  contracting  product and rate  financial and reporting requirements 
there are laws and regulations that set specific standards for delivery of services  payment of claims  protection of consumer health information and covered benefits and services 
additionally  states have begun to focus their anti fraud efforts on insurance companies and health maintenance organizations 
some states now require filing and approval of anti fraud plans and may monitor compliance as part of a market conduct examination 
we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with the applicable laws and regulations 
hipaa the administrative simplification provisions of the health insurance portability and accountability act of  as amended hipaa  apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets  including self funded employee benefit plans 
federal regulations promulgated pursuant to hipaa are now effective 
these regulations include minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets  and for the privacy and security of protected health information 
we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these regulations 
new standards for national provider and employer identifiers are currently being implemented by regulators 
we have been and intend to remain in compliance in all material respects with these regulations 
additionally  different approaches to hipaa s provisions and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines 
erisa the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa  regulates how goods and services are provided to or through certain types of employer sponsored health benefit plans 
erisa is a set of laws and regulations subject to periodic interpretation by the united states department of labor as well as the federal courts 
erisa places controls on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee benefit health plans  particularly those that maintain self funded plans 
we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable erisa regulations

these include routine  regular and special investigations  audits  and reviews by cms  state insurance and health and welfare departments and state attorneys general  the office of the inspector general  the office of personnel management  the office of civil rights  the department of justice and us attorneys 
such government actions can result in assessment of damages  civil or criminal fines or penalties  or other sanctions  including loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs 
we do not believe the results of any of the current investigations  audits or reviews  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

table of contents international regulation our ingenix  uniprise and health care services segments have limited international operations 
these international operations are subject to different legal and regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions  including various tax  tariff and trade regulations  as well as employment  intellectual property and investment rules and laws

our specialized care services and ingenix business segments also compete with a number of businesses 
new entrants into the markets in which we compete  as well as consolidation within these markets  also contribute to a competitive environment 
we believe the principal competitive factors that can impact our businesses relate to the sales and pricing of our products and services  product innovation  consumer satisfaction  the level and quality of products and services  care delivery  network capabilities  market share  product distribution systems  efficiency of administration operations  financial strength and marketplace reputation

financial condition  liquidity and capital resources at december  liquidity and capital resources we manage our cash  investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short and long term obligations of our business while maintaining strong financial flexibility and liquidity 
we forecast  analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy 
our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations 
a majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash  cash equivalents and investments 
after considering expected cash flows from operating activities  we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceed our short term obligations in longer term  investment grade  marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return 
factors we consider in making these investment decisions include our board of directors approved investment policy  regulatory limitations  return objectives  tax implications  risk tolerance and maturity dates 
our long term investments are also available for sale to meet short term liquidity and other needs 
cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated entities are paid to their non regulated parent companies  typically in the form of dividends  for general corporate use  when and as permitted by applicable regulations 
our non regulated businesses also generate significant cash from operations for general corporate use 
cash flows generated by these entities  combined with the issuance of commercial paper  long term debt and the availability of committed credit facilities  further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility 
we generally use these cash flows to reinvest in our businesses in the form of capital expenditures  to expand the depth and breadth of our services through business acquisitions  and to repurchase shares of our common stock  depending on market conditions 
cash flows generated from operating activities  our primary source of liquidity  are principally from net earnings  excluding depreciation and amortization 
as a result  any future decline in our profitability may have a negative 
table of contents impact on our liquidity 
the level of profitability of our risk based business depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict and price for health care and operating cost increases 
this risk is partially mitigated by the diversity of our other businesses  the geographic diversity of our risk based business and our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes  which seek to match premium rate increases with future health care costs 
in  a hypothetical unexpected increase in commercial insured medical costs would have reduced net earnings by approximately million 
the availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors  including our profitability  operating cash flows  debt levels  debt ratings  debt covenants and other contractual restrictions  regulatory requirements and market conditions 
we believe that our strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility mitigate much of this risk 
cash and investments cash flows from operating activities were billion in  representing an increase over of billion  or 
this increase in operating cash flows resulted primarily from an increase of million in net income excluding depreciation  amortization and other noncash items 
additionally  operating cash flows increased by million due to cash generated by working capital changes  driven in part by improved cash collections leading to decreases in accounts receivable and increases in unearned premiums  and an increase in medical costs payable 
as premium revenues and related medical costs increase  we generate incremental operating cash flows because we collect premium revenues in advance of the claim payments for related medical costs 
we maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position  with cash and investments of billion at december  total cash and investments increased by billion since december   primarily due to billion in cash and investments acquired in the oxford and mamsi acquisitions and strong operating cash flows  partially offset by common stock repurchases  cash paid for business acquisitions and capital expenditures 
as further described under regulatory capital and dividend restrictions  many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies 
at december   approximately million of our billion of cash and investments was held by non regulated subsidiaries 
of this amount  approximately million was segregated for future regulatory capital needs and the remainder was available for general corporate use  including acquisitions and share repurchases 
financing and investing activities in addition to our strong cash flows generated by operating activities  we use commercial paper and debt to maintain adequate operating and financial flexibility 
as of december  and  we had commercial paper and debt outstanding of approximately billion and billion  respectively 
our debt to total capital ratio was and as of december  and december   respectively 
we believe the prudent use of debt leverage optimizes our cost of capital and return on shareholders equity  while maintaining appropriate liquidity

we used the proceeds from the borrowings to repay commercial paper and maturing term debt  and for general corporate purposes including working capital  capital expenditures  business acquisitions and share repurchases 
we entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert our interest exposure on a majority of these and borrowings from a fixed to a variable rate 
the interest rate swap agreements on these borrowings have aggregate notional amounts of billion 
at december   the rate used to accrue interest expense on these agreements ranged from to 
the differential between the fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued and recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations

this credit facility replaced our existing million revolving facility that was set to expire in july  and our million  day facility that was set to expire in july as of december   we had no amounts outstanding under this credit facility 
commercial paper increased from million at december   to million at december  our debt arrangements and credit facility contain various covenants  the most restrictive of which require us to maintain a debt to total capital ratio calculated as the sum of commercial paper and debt divided by the sum of commercial paper  debt and shareholders equity below and to exceed specified minimum interest coverage levels 
we are in compliance with the requirements of all debt covenants 
our senior debt is rated a by standard poor s s p and fitch  and a with a positive outlook by moody s 
our commercial paper is rated a by s p  f by fitch  and p with a positive outlook by moody s 
consistent with our intention of maintaining our senior debt ratings in the a range  we intend to maintain our debt to total capital ratio at approximately or less 
a significant downgrade in our debt or commercial paper ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and costs 
under our board of directors authorization  we maintain a common stock repurchase program 
repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices  subject to certain restrictions on volume  pricing and timing 
during  we repurchased million shares at an average price of approximately per share and an aggregate cost of approximately billion 
as of december   we had board of directors authorization to purchase up to an additional million shares of our common stock 
our common stock repurchase program 
table of contents is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares 
we repurchase shares because we believe it is a prudent use of capital 
a decision by the company to discontinue share repurchases would significantly increase our liquidity and financial flexibility 
under our s shelf registration statement for common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and other securities  the remaining issuing capacity of all covered securities is million 
we intend to file a new s shelf registration statement during the first half of to increase our remaining issuing capacity

we believe the likelihood of a debt covenant violation is remote 
minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services 
estimated payments required under life and annuity contracts 
includes obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs and minority interest purchase commitments 
currently  we do not have any other material contractual obligations  off balance sheet arrangements or commitments that require cash resources  however  we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations 
this includes internal development of new products  programs and technology applications  and may include acquisitions 
aarp in january  we entered into a year contract to provide health insurance products and services to members of aarp 
these products and services are provided to supplement benefits covered under traditional medicare 
under the terms of the contract  we are compensated for transaction processing and other services as well as for assuming underwriting risk 
we are also engaged in product development activities to complement the insurance offerings under this program 
premium revenues from our portion of the aarp insurance offerings were approximately billion in  billion in and billion in the underwriting gains or losses related to the aarp business are directly recorded as an increase or decrease to a rate stabilization fund rsf 
the primary components of the underwriting results are premium revenue  medical costs  investment income  administrative expenses  member services expenses  marketing expenses and premium taxes 
underwriting gains and losses are recorded as an increase or decrease to the rsf and accrue to the overall benefit of the aarp policyholders  unless cumulative net losses were to exceed the balance in the 
table of contents rsf 
to the extent underwriting losses exceed the balance in the rsf  we would have to fund the deficit 
any deficit we fund could be recovered by underwriting gains in future periods of the contract 
to date  we have not been required to fund any underwriting deficits 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the rsf balance is reported in other policy liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we believe the rsf balance is sufficient to cover potential future underwriting or other risks associated with the contract 
regulatory capital and dividend restrictions we conduct a significant portion of our operations through companies that are subject to standards established by the national association of insurance commissioners naic 
these standards  among other things  require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies 
generally  the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary  without prior approval by state regulatory authorities  is limited based on the entity s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 
the agencies that assess our creditworthiness also consider capital adequacy levels when establishing our debt ratings 
consistent with our intent to maintain our senior debt ratings in the a range  we maintain an aggregate statutory capital level for our regulated subsidiaries that is significantly higher than the minimum level regulators require 
as of december   our regulated subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital of approximately billion  which is significantly more than the aggregate minimum regulatory requirements 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make the most challenging  subjective or complex judgments  often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
critical accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe our most critical accounting policies are those described below 
for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
medical costs each reporting period  we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed  and for liabilities for physician  hospital and other medical cost disputes 
we develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied  centrally controlled and automated 
the actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt  claim backlogs  seasonal variances in medical care consumption  provider contract rate changes  medical care utilization and other medical cost trends  membership volume and demographics  benefit plan changes  and business mix changes related to products  customers and geography 
depending on the health care provider and type of service  the typical billing lag for services can range from two to days from the date of service 
substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to months from the date of service 
we estimate liabilities for physician  hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
each period  we re examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances 
as the liability estimates recorded in prior periods become more exact  we increase or decrease the amount of the estimates  and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified 
in every reporting period  our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods 
if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate  we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period favorable development 
if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate  we will increase reported medical costs in the current period unfavorable 
table of contents development 
historically  the net impact of estimate developments has represented less than one half of of annual medical costs  less than of annual earnings from operations and less than of medical costs payable 
in order to evaluate the impact of changes in medical cost estimates for any particular discrete period  one should consider both the amount of development recorded in the current period pertaining to prior periods and the amount of development recorded in subsequent periods pertaining to the current period 
the accompanying table provides a summary of the net impact of favorable development on medical costs and earnings from operations in millions 
favorable development net impact on medical costs a medical costs earnings from operations as reported as adjusted b as reported as adjusted b c  c  c a the amount of favorable development recorded in the current year pertaining to the prior year less the amount of favorable development recorded in the subsequent year pertaining to the current year 
b represents reported amounts adjusted to reflect the net impact of medical cost development 
c not yet determinable as the amount of prior period development recorded in will change as our december  medical costs payable estimate develops throughout our estimate of medical costs payable represents management s best estimate of the company s liability for unpaid medical costs as of december   developed using consistently applied actuarial methods 
management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover the company s liability for unpaid claims as of december   however  actual claim payments may differ from established estimates 
assuming a hypothetical difference between our december  estimates of medical costs payable and actual costs payable  excluding the aarp business  earnings from operations would increase or decrease by million and diluted net earnings per common share would increase or decrease by approximately per share 
long lived assets as of december   we had long lived assets  including goodwill  other intangible assets  property  equipment and capitalized software  of billion 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level  and we review our remaining long lived assets for impairment when events and changes in circumstances indicate we might not recover their carrying value 
to determine the fair value of the respective assets and assess the recoverability of our long lived assets  we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors including estimated future utility and estimated future cash flows  which in turn are based on estimates of future revenues  expenses and operating margins 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets that could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs 
investments as of december   we had approximately billion of investments  primarily held in marketable debt securities 
our investments are principally classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value 
we exclude unrealized gains and losses on investments available for sale from earnings and report them together  net of income tax effects  as a separate component in shareholders equity 
we continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments 
as of december   our investments had gross unrealized gains of million and gross unrealized losses of million 
if any of our investments experience a decline in fair value that is determined to be other than temporary  based on analysis of relevant factors  we record a realized loss in our consolidated statements of operations 
management judgment is involved in evaluating whether a decline in an investment s fair value is other than temporary 
new information and the 
table of contents passage of time can change these judgments 
we revise impairment judgments when new information becomes known and record any resulting impairment charges at that time 
we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or industry and largely limit our investments to us government and agency securities  state and municipal securities  and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade 
revenues revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums 
we recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services 
customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services  as recorded in our records 
employer groups generally provide us with changes to their eligible population one month in arrears 
each billing includes an adjustment for prior month changes in eligibility status that were not reflected in our previous billing 
we estimate and adjust the current period s revenues and accounts receivable accordingly 
our estimates are based on historical trends  premiums billed  the level of contract renewal activity and other relevant information 
we revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period  and record changes in the period they become known 
contingent liabilities because of the nature of our businesses  we are routinely involved in various disputes  legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations 
we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters 
our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverages  if any  for such matters 
we do not believe any matters currently threatened or pending will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions 
inflation the current national health care cost inflation rate significantly exceeds the general inflation rate 
we use various strategies to lessen the effects of health care cost inflation 
these include setting commercial premiums based on anticipated health care costs and coordinating care with physicians and other health care providers 
through contracts with physicians and other health care providers  we emphasize preventive health care  appropriate use of health care services consistent with clinical performance standards  education and closing gaps in care 
we believe our strategies to mitigate the impact of health care cost inflation on our operating results have been and will continue to be successful 
however  other factors including competitive pressures  new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions  demands from physicians and other health care providers and consumers  major epidemics  and applicable regulations may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost inflation 
because of the narrow operating margins of our risk based products  changes in medical cost trends that were not anticipated in establishing premium rates can create significant changes in our financial results 
legal matters because of the nature of our businesses  we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design  management and offerings of our services 
we record liabilities for our estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters 
these matters include  but are not limited to  claims relating to health care benefits coverage  medical malpractice actions  contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices 
following the events of september   the cost of business insurance coverage increased significantly 
as a result  we have increased the amount of risk that we self insure  particularly with respect to matters incidental to our business 

table of contents in re managed care litigation mdl no 
beginning in  a series of class action lawsuits were filed against us and virtually all major entities in the health benefits business 
in december  a multidistrict litigation panel consolidated several litigation cases involving unitedhealth group and our affiliates in the southern district court of florida  miami division 
generally  the health care provider plaintiffs allege violations of erisa and rico in connection with alleged undisclosed policies intended to maximize profits 
other allegations include breach of state prompt payment laws and breach of contract claims for failure to timely reimburse providers for medical services rendered 
the consolidated suits seek injunctive  compensatory and equitable relief as well as restitution  costs  fees and interest payments 
the trial court granted the health care providers motion for class certification and that order was reviewed by the eleventh circuit court of appeals 
the eleventh circuit affirmed the class action status of the rico claims  but reversed as to the breach of contract  unjust enrichment and prompt payment claims 
through a series of motions and appeals  all direct claims against unitedhealthcare have been compelled to arbitration 
the trial court has denied unitedhealthcare s further motion to compel the secondary rico claims to arbitration and the eleventh circuit affirmed that order 
a trial date has been set for september the trial court has ordered that the trial be bifurcated into separate liability and damage proceedings 
the american medical association et al 
v 
metropolitan life insurance company  united healthcare services 
inc and unitedhealth group 
on march   the american medical association filed a lawsuit against the company in the supreme court of the state of new york  county of new york 
on april   we removed this case to the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
the suit alleges causes of action based on erisa  as well as breach of contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing  deceptive acts and practices  and trade libel in connection with the calculation of reasonable and customary reimbursement rates for non network providers 
the suit seeks declaratory  injunctive and compensatory relief as well as costs  fees and interest payments 
an amended complaint was filed on august   which alleged two classes of plaintiffs  an erisa class and a non erisa class 
after the court dismissed certain erisa claims and the claims brought by the american medical association  a third amended complaint was filed 
on october   the court granted in part and denied in part our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint 
on may   we filed a counterclaim complaint in this matter alleging antitrust violations against the american medical association and asserting claims based on improper billing practices against an individual provider plaintiff 
on may   we filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking the dismissal of certain claims and parties based  in part  due to lack of standing 
on july   plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint  seeking to assert rico violations 
although the results of pending litigation are always uncertain  we do not believe the results of any such actions currently threatened or pending  including those described above  will  individually or in aggregate  have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks market risk represents the risk of changes in the fair value of a financial instrument caused by changes in interest rates or equity prices 
the company s primary market risk is exposure to changes in interest rates that could impact the fair value of our investments and long term debt 
approximately billion of our cash equivalents and investments at december  were debt securities 
assuming a hypothetical and immediate increase or decrease in interest rates applicable to our fixed income investment portfolio at december   the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease or increase by approximately million 
we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or industry and largely limit our investments to us government and agency securities  state and municipal securities  and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade 
to mitigate the financial impact of changes in interest rates  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to more closely match the interest rates of our long term debt with those of our cash equivalents and short term 
table of contents investments 
including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements  approximately billion of our commercial paper and debt had variable rates of interest and million had fixed rates as of december  a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to the fair value of our commercial paper and debt 
at december   we had million of equity investments  primarily held by our unitedhealth capital business in various public and non public companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies 
market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will likewise impact the value of our equity portfolio 
concentrations of credit risk investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject unitedhealth group to concentrations of credit risk 
our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our board of directors 
this policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to us government and agency securities  state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base 
as of december   there were no significant concentrations of credit risk 
cautionary statements the statements contained in this annual report on form k include forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the pslra 
when used in this annual report on form k and in future filings by us with the securities and exchange commission  in our news releases  presentations to securities analysts or investors  and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers  the words or phrases believes  anticipates  expects  plans  seeks  intends  will likely result  estimates  projects or similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
the following discussion contains certain cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider 
this discussion is intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the pslra 
except to the extent otherwise required by federal securities laws  we do not undertake to address or update forward looking statements in future filings or communications regarding our business or operating results  and do not undertake to address how any of these factors may have caused results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications 
in addition  any of the matters discussed below may have affected past  as well as current  forward looking statements about future results 
any or all forward looking statements in this form k and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong 
they can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties 
many factors discussed below will be important in determining future results 
consequently  no forward looking statement can be guaranteed 
actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed in our prior communications 
we must effectively manage our health care costs 
under our risk based product arrangements  we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums 
premium revenues from risk based products excluding aarp have typically comprised approximately to of our total consolidated revenues 
we generally use approximately to of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our customers 
the profitability of our risk based products depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict  price for  and effectively manage health care costs 
total health care costs are affected by the number of 
table of contents individual services rendered and the cost of each service 
our premium revenue is typically fixed in price for a month period and is generally priced one to four months before contract commencement 
services are delivered and related costs are incurred when the contract commences 
although we base the premiums we charge on our estimate of future health care costs over the fixed premium period  inflation  regulations and other factors may cause actual costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums 
these factors may include increased use of services  increased cost of individual services  catastrophes  epidemics  the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology  new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use 
as a measure of the impact of medical cost on our financial results  relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results 
if medical costs increased by percent without a proportional change in related revenues for unitedhealthcare s commercial insured products  our annual net earnings for would have been reduced by approximately million 
in addition  the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which we have not received the underlying claims or for which we have received the claims but not yet processed them 
if these estimates prove too high or too low  the effect of the change in estimate will be included in future results 
that change can be either positive or negative to our results 
we face competition in many of our markets and customers have flexibility in moving between competitors 
our businesses compete throughout the united states and face competition in all of the geographic markets in which they operate 
for our uniprise and health care services segments  competitors include aetna inc  cigna corporation  coventry health care  inc  humana inc  pacificare health systems  inc  wellchoice  inc  and wellpoint  inc  numerous for profit and not for profit organizations operating under licenses from the blue cross blue shield association and other enterprises concentrated in more limited geographic areas 
our specialized care services and ingenix segments also compete with a number of businesses 
the addition of new competitors for at least the short term can occur relatively easily  and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors 
in particular markets  competitors may have capabilities that give them a competitive advantage 
greater market share  established reputation  superior supplier arrangements  existing business relationships  and other factors all can provide a competitive advantage to our businesses or to their competitors 
in addition  significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industries in which we operate  both as to our competitors and suppliers in these industries 
consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase customers  to improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers  or to maintain or advance profitability 
our relationship with aarp is important under our year contract with aarp  which commenced in  we provide medicare supplement and hospital indemnity health insurance and other products to aarp members 
as of december   our portion of aarp s insurance program represented approximately billion in annual net premium revenue from approximately million aarp members 
the aarp contract may be terminated early by us or aarp under certain circumstances  including a material breach by either party  insolvency of either party  a material adverse change in the financial condition of either party  and by mutual agreement 
the success of our aarp arrangement depends  in part  on our ability to service aarp and its members  develop additional products and services  price the products and services competitively  and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes 
the favorable and unfavorable effects of changes in medicare are uncertain 
the medicare changes being implemented as a result of the medicare modernization act of are complex and wide ranging 
there are numerous changes that will influence our business 
we have invested considerable resources analyzing how to best address uncertainties and risks associated with the changes that may arise 
in january  the centers for medicare and medicaid services released detailed regulations on major aspects of 
table of contents the legislation  however  some important requirements related to the implementation of the new product offerings  including the part d prescription drug benefit and the regional medicare advantage preferred provider organizations  have not yet been released by the federal government  thus creating challenges for planning and implementation 
we believe the increased funding provided in the legislation will increase the number of competitors in the seniors health services market 
our business is subject to government scrutiny  and we must respond quickly and appropriately to changes in government regulations 
our business is regulated at the federal  state  local and international levels 
the laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change 
broad latitude is given to the agencies administering those regulations 
existing or future laws and rules could force us to change how we do business  restrict revenue and enrollment growth  increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements  and increase our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations  contract interpretation and other actions 
we must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products  to increase prices for certain regulated products and to consummate our acquisitions and dispositions 
delays in obtaining or our failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs 
we participate in federal  state and local government health care coverage programs 
these programs generally are subject to frequent change  including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible  reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels  or increase our administrative or health care costs under such programs 
such changes have adversely affected our financial results and willingness to participate in such programs in the past  and may do so in the future 
state legislatures and congress continue to focus on health care issues 
legislative and regulatory proposals at state and federal levels may affect certain aspects of our business  including contracting with physicians  hospitals and other health care professionals  physician reimbursement methods and payment rates  coverage determinations  claim payments and processing  drug utilization and patient safety efforts  use and maintenance of individually identifiable health information  medical malpractice litigation  and government sponsored programs 
we cannot predict if any of these initiatives will ultimately become binding law or regulation  or  if enacted  what their terms will be  but their enactment could increase our costs  expose us to expanded liability  require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business 
we typically have and are currently involved in various governmental investigations  audits and reviews 
these include routine  regular and special investigations  audits and reviews by cms  state insurance and health and welfare departments and state attorneys general  the office of the inspector general  the office of personnel management  the office of civil rights  the department of justice and us attorneys 
such government actions can result in assessment of damages  civil or criminal fines or penalties  or other sanctions  including loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs 
important relationships with physicians  hospitals and other health care providers 
we contract with physicians  hospitals  pharmaceutical benefit service providers  pharmaceutical manufacturers  and other health care providers for competitive prices 
our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to maintain these competitive prices 
a number of organizations are advocating for legislation that would exempt certain of these physicians and health care professionals from federal and state antitrust laws 
in any particular market  these physicians and health care professionals could refuse to contract  demand higher payments  or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs  less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements 
in some markets  certain health care providers  particularly hospitals  physician hospital organizations or multi specialty physician groups  may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part 

table of contents the nature of our business exposes us to litigation risks  and our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover some of the costs associated with litigation 
periodically  we become a party to the types of legal actions that can affect any business  such as employment and employment discrimination related suits  employee benefit claims  breach of contract actions  tort claims  shareholder suits  and intellectual property related litigation 
in addition  because of the nature of our business  we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design  management and offerings of our services 
these matters include  but are not limited to  claims related to health care benefits coverage  medical malpractice actions  contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices 
in  a number of class action lawsuits were filed against us and virtually all major entities in the health benefits business 
the suits are purported class actions on behalf of physicians for alleged breaches of federal statutes  including the employee retirement income security act of erisa and the racketeer influenced corrupt organization act rico 
in march  the american medical association filed a lawsuit against us in connection with the calculation of reasonable and customary reimbursement rates for non network providers 
although the expenses which we have incurred to date in defending the class action lawsuits and the american medical association lawsuit have not been material to our business  we will continue to incur expenses in the defense of these lawsuits and other matters  even if they are without merit 
following the events of september   the cost of business insurance coverage has increased significantly 
as a result  we have increased the amount of risk that we self insure  particularly with respect to matters incidental to our business 
we believe that we are adequately insured for claims in excess of our self insurance  however  certain types of damages  such as punitive damages  are not covered by insurance 
we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self insured matters 
although we believe the liabilities established for these risks are adequate  it is possible that the level of actual losses may exceed the liabilities recorded 
our businesses depend on effective information systems and the integrity of the data in our information systems 
our ability to adequately price our products and services  provide effective and efficient service to our customers  and to accurately report our financial results depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems 
as a result of our acquisition activities  we have acquired additional systems 
we have been taking steps to reduce the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities 
if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity  we could lose existing customers  have difficulty attracting new customers  have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing  have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes  have regulatory problems  have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences 
we use or employ independent third parties  such as international business machines corporation ibm  with whom we have entered into agreements  for significant portions of our data center operations 
even though we have appropriate provisions in our agreements  including provisions with respect to specific performance standards  covenants  warranties  audit rights  indemnification  and other provisions  our dependence on these third parties makes our operations vulnerable to their failure to perform adequately under the contracts  due to internal or external factors 
although there are a limited number of service organizations with the size  scale and capabilities to effectively provide certain of these services  we believe that other organizations could provide similar services on comparable terms 
a change in service providers  however  could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms 
we have intangible assets  whose values may become impaired 
due largely to our recent acquisitions  goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately billion as of december   
table of contents representing approximately of our total assets 
if we make additional acquisitions  it is likely that we will record additional intangible assets on our books 
we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable  in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary 
any future evaluations requiring an asset impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs 
a material decrease in shareholders equity could  in turn  negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants 
we must comply with emerging restrictions on patient privacy and information security  including taking steps to ensure compliance by our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information when providing services to us 
the use of individually identifiable data by our businesses is regulated at the international  federal and state levels 
these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation 
various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data 
most are derived from the privacy and security provisions in the federal gramm leach bliley act and hipaa 
hipaa also imposes guidelines on our business associates as this term is defined in the hipaa regulations 
even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our business associates  we still have limited control over their actions and practices 
compliance with these proposals  requirements  and new regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes  the development of new administrative processes  and the effects of potential noncompliance by our business associates 
they also may impose further restrictions on our use of patient identifiable data that is housed in one or more of our administrative databases 
our knowledge and information related businesses depend on our ability to maintain proprietary rights to our databases and related products 
we rely on our agreements with customers  confidentiality agreements with employees  and our trade secrets  copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights 
these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information 
in addition  substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry  and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows 
such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services 
the effects of the war on terror and future terrorist attacks could impact the health care industry 
the terrorist attacks launched on september   the war on terrorism  the threat of future acts of terrorism and the related concerns of customers and providers have negatively affected  and may continue to negatively affect  the us economy in general and our industry specifically 
depending on the government s actions and the responsiveness of public health agencies and insurance companies  future acts of terrorism and bio terrorism could lead to  among other things  increased use of health care services including  without limitation  hospital and physician services  loss of membership in health benefit programs we administer as a result of lay offs or other reductions of employment  adverse effects upon the financial condition or business of employers who sponsor health care coverage for their employees  disruption of our information and payment systems  increased health care costs due to restrictions on our ability to carve out certain categories of risk  such as acts of terrorism  and disruption of the financial and insurance markets in general
