years ago amvac considered itself a distributor formulator  but now amvac primarily manufactures  distributes  and formulates its own proprietary products or custom manufactures or formulates for others 
in december  amvac entered into an agreement with bayer cropscience lp  an affiliate of bayer ag  to market  sell and distribute bolster g  a soybean pesticide used to control nematodes  through amvac s smartbox system in key midwest soybean growing states beginning in the season 
additionally  in december  amvac licensed the trade name nuvan to syngenta india limited  a business unit of syngenta crop protection ag 
the agreement provides a two year license to syngenta india to sell products under the nuvan name in the animal and public health market  as well as the crop protection market in india

in december  amvac acquired certain assets related to the active ingredient dichlorvos ddvp used in the animal health business and marketed primarily under the trade name nuvan from novartis animal health  inc a business unit of novartis ag 
since  amvac has manufactured a technical form of ddvp  used primarily in specialty markets as a broad spectrum household and specialty insecticide

in january  amvac acquired certain assets associated with the evital g cranberry herbicide business conducted in the united states from syngenta 
in july  amvac acquired from flowserve us inc flowserve  all or substantially all of its assets associated with the smartbox closed delivery system 
the smartbox system electronically dispenses granular crop protection products  replacing older technology that utilizes mechanically driven sprockets and chains 
the state of the art smartbox technology allows farmers to apply crop protection products accurately and efficiently while avoiding contact with the product 
the computer controller enables farmers to monitor and change application rates while planting and provides the farmers with a permanent record of application 
initially the smartbox system was developed by flowserve in partnership with ei dupont de nemours and company dupont and zeneca  inc which partnership commenced in at the same time it acquired certain assets associated with the fortress corn soil insecticide business from dupont in  amvac assumed dupont s smartbox partnership interest 
thereafter  zeneca  inc abandoned its smartbox partnership interest 
in  amvac sold its fortress g active ingredient chlorethoxyfoxs corn soil insecticide to the american farmer in the smartbox system 
later that year  amvac secured exclusive marketing rights in the us bayer cropscience s aztec g corn soil insecticide which also can be applied through the smartbox system 
by offering both products  amvac provides farmers a choice of two different chemistries to apply through the smartbox system 
this allows farmers to rotate products from year to year  thereby preventing insects from building resistance to any one specific product 
amvac is currently looking at utilizing this system for other crops where the safety features of the system would provide an important benefit 
in july  amvac acquired from syngenta all us environmental protection agency epa end use product registrations and data support as well as a license to the ambush wp trademark wettable powder formulation in the united states

seasonality the agricultural chemical industry in general is cyclical in nature 
the demand for amvac s products tends to be slightly seasonal 
seasonal usage  however  does not necessarily follow calendar dates  but more closely follows varying growing seasonal patterns  weather conditions and weather related pressure from pests  and customer marketing programs and requirements 
backlog amvac does not believe that backlog is a significant factor in its business 
amvac primarily sells its products on the basis of purchase orders  although it has entered into requirements contracts with certain customers 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries customers united agri products  helena chemical company and agriliance accounted for  and  respectively of the company s sales in helena chemical company and united agri products accounted for each of the company s sales in united agri products  agriliance and helena chemical company accounted for  and  respectively of the company s sales in united agri products  helena and agriliance are distributors of the company s products 
competition amvac faces competition from many domestic and foreign manufacturers in its marketplaces 
competition in amvac s marketplace is based primarily on efficacy  price  safety and ease of application 
many of such competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial and technical resources than amvac 
amvac s ability to compete depends on its ability to develop additional applications for its current products and expand its product lines and customer base 
amvac competes principally on the basis of the quality of its products price and the technical service and support given to its customers 
the inability of amvac to effectively compete in several of amvac s principal products would have a material adverse effect on amvac s results of operations 
generally  the treatment against pests of any kind is broad in scope  there being more than one way or one product for treatment  eradication  or suppression 
amvac has attempted to position itself in smaller niche markets which are no longer of strong focus to larger companies 
these markets are small by nature  require significant and intensive management input  ongoing product research  and are near product maturity 
these types of markets tend not to attract larger chemical companies due to the smaller volume demand  and larger chemical companies have been divesting themselves of products that fall into such niches as is evidenced by amvac s successful acquisitions of certain product lines 
intellectual property amvac s proprietary product formulations are protected  to the extent possible  as trade secrets and  to a lesser extent  by patents and trademarks 
although amvac considers that  in the aggregate  its trademarks  licenses  and patents constitute a valuable asset  it does not regard its business as being materially dependent upon any single or several trademarks  licenses  or patents 
epa registrations amvac s products also receive protection afforded by the effect of the fifra legislation that makes it unlawful to sell any pesticide in the united states unless such pesticide has first been registered by the epa as well as under similar state laws 
substantially all of amvac s products are subject to epa registration and re registration requirements and are conditionally registered in accordance with fifra 
this licensing by epa is based  among other things  on data demonstrating that the product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment when it is used according to approved label directions 
all states where any of amvac s products are used require a registration by that specific state before it can be marketed or used in that state 
state registrations are renewed annually  as appropriate 
the epa and state agencies have required  and may require in the future  that certain scientific data requirements be performed on registered products sold by amvac 
amvac  on its own behalf and in joint efforts with other registrants  has furnished  and is currently furnishing  certain required data relative to specific products 
under fifra  the federal government requires registrants to submit a wide range of scientific data to support us registrations 
this requirement results in operating expenses in such areas as testing and the 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries production of new products 
amvac expensed   and  during  and respectively  related to gathering this information 
based on facts known today  amvac estimates it will spend approximately  in because scientific analyses are constantly improving  it cannot be determined with certainty whether or not new or additional tests may be required by the regulatory authorities 
additionally  while fifra good laboratory practice standards specify the minimum practices and procedures which must be followed in order to ensure the quality and integrity of data related to these tests submitted to the epa  there can be no assurance the epa will not request certain tests studies be repeated 
amvac expenses these costs on an as incurred basis 
see also part ii  item of this annual report for discussions pertaining to research and development expenses 
raw materials amvac utilizes numerous firms as well as internal sources to supply the various raw materials and components used by amvac in manufacturing its products 
many of these materials are readily available from domestic sources 
in those instances where there is a single source of supply or where the source is not domestic  amvac seeks to secure its supply by either long term arrangements or advance purchases from its suppliers 
amvac believes that it is considered to be a valued customer to such sole source suppliers 
recent increases in energy costs are expected to have an adverse impact on the company  although the ultimate impact cannot be measured at this time 
environmental during  amvac continued activities to address environmental issues associated with its facility the facility in commerce  california 
in march  the california environmental protection agency department of toxic substances control dtsc accepted the facility into its expedited remedial action program erap 
under this program  the facility must prepare and implement an environmental investigation plan 
depending on the findings of the investigation  the facility may also be required to develop and implement remedial measures to address any historical environmental impairment 
the environmental investigation and any remediation activities related to ten underground storage tanks at the facility  which had been closed in  will also be addressed by amvac under erap 
soil and groundwater characterization activities began in december in accordance with the site investigation plan that was approved by the dtsc 
additional activities were conducted in and with oversight provided by the dtsc 
additional investigation is planned over the next year under the oversight of the dtsc 
potential remediation activities may be initiated in late these investigation and potential remediation activities are required at all facilities that currently have  or in the past had  hazardous waste storage permits 
because amvac previously held a hazardous waste management permit  amvac is subject to these requirements 
the cost associated with the potential remediation activities is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
amvac is subject to numerous federal and state laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee health and safety at the commerce  california and axis  alabama facilities 
amvac continually adapts its manufacturing process to the environmental control standards of the various regulatory agencies 
the us epa and other federal and state agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that could have an impact on amvac s operations 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries amvac expends substantial funds to minimize the discharge of materials in the environment and to comply with the governmental regulations relating to protection of the environment 
wherever feasible  amvac recovers raw materials and increases product yield in order to partially offset increasing pollution abatement costs 
the company is committed to a long term environmental protection program that reduces emissions of hazardous materials into the environment  as well as to the remediation of identified existing environmental concerns 
federal and state authorities may seek fines and penalties for violation of the various laws and governmental regulations 
as part of its continuing environmental program  except as disclosed in part i  item  legal proceedings  of this annual report  the company has been able to comply with such proceedings and orders without any materially adverse effect on its business 
employees as of march   the company employed approximately persons 
amvac  on an ongoing basis  due to the seasonality of its business  uses temporary contract personnel to perform certain duties primarily related to packaging of its products 
the company believes it is cost beneficial to employ temporary contract personnel 
none of the company s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
the company believes it maintains positive relations with its employees

the office is located in surrey  england  a city southwest of london 
the operating results of this operation were not material to the company s total operating results for the years ended december   and the company classifies as export sales all products bearing foreign labeling shipped to a foreign destination 
export sales percentage of net sales risk management the company continually evaluates insurance levels for product liability  property damage and other potential areas of risk 
management believes its facilities and equipment are adequately insured against loss from usual business risks 
the company has purchased claims made products liability insurance 
there can be no assurance  however  that such products liability coverage insurance will continue to be available to the company  or if available  that it will be provided at an economical cost to the company

item legal proceedings dbcp lawsuits a 
hawaii matters amvac and the company were served with complaints in february the actions were filed in the circuit court of the second circuit  state of hawaii entitled board of water supply of the county of maui v 
shell oil co  et 
al 
the suit named as defendants the company  amvac  shell oil company  the dow chemical company  occidental chemical company  occidental petroleum corporation  occidental chemical corporation  and brewer environmental industry  inc maui pineapple company was joined as a cross defendant 
the complaint alleged that between two and four of the board s wells had been contaminated with  dibromo chloropropane dbcp in excess of the maximum contaminant level mcl 
in addition  the board of water supply contended that future wells may exceed the mcl level and would need remediation 
while the suit could only include damages that had incurred by the time of the scheduled trial date of october   future suits could be filed as a well became contaminated 
on august   a global settlement was reached  which included the remediation of the existing contaminated wells in addition to the installation of filtration devices on other wells for the next forty years on the island of maui 
the cash settlement was three million dollars  of which amvac s and the company s portion was five hundred thousand dollars 

as to matters independent of indemnity issues  the company recovered four hundred thousand dollars  from one of its insurers 
the settlement agreement obligates the defendants to pay for the ongoing operation and maintenance of the filtration devices for up to forty years 
the annual costs of operation and maintenance per well is estimated to be approximately sixty nine thousand dollars  to be adjusted annually by the consumer price index 
the defendants are also obligated to pay between ninety and one hundred percent for the cost of the installation of filtration devices on other wells that may exceed the defined maximum contaminant level in the next forty years 
the number of future wells needing remediation could be less than six or more than that amount  however  the maximum number of wells subject to remediation under the agreement is fifty 
amvac s share of the ongoing operation and maintenance charges and installation of additional devices on other wells is seventeen and one half percent 
the obligations of the defendants under this agreement are secured by a twenty million dollar letter of credit obtained by dow chemical 
amvac will pay seventeen and one half percent of the annual cost of the letter 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries of credit which does not have a material impact on the company s financial statements directly to dow chemical 
on june   amvac was notified that the plaintiff had completed conversion of the h poko wells from a temporary to a permanent filtration facility 
after credits of approximately eight hundred thousand dollars  from the settlement were deducted from the one million eight hundred thousand dollars  cost of a two vessel system  the claim to the defendants was one million dollars 
the cost of the temporary facility was included in the original settlement 
on january   defendants were notified that the claim by the plaintiff would be submitted in approximately sixty days 
amvac s share of the permanent filtration system will be one hundred and seventy five thousand dollars  which has been accrued for reserved by the company 
thus far  no additional wells have been remediated nor have there been ongoing operation and maintenance charges 
in october  amvac was served with a complaint s in which it was named as a defendant  filed in the circuit court  first circuit  state of hawaii and in the circuit court of the second circuit  state of hawaii two identical suits entitled patrickson  et

american vanguard corporation has not been sued in these actions 
the ten named plaintiffs are citizens of four countries guatemala  costa rica  panama  and ecuador 
punitive damages are sought against each defendant 
the plaintiffs were banana workers and allege that they were exposed to dbcp in applying the product in their native countries 
the case was also filed as a class action on behalf of other workers so exposed in these four countries 
the plaintiffs allege sterility and other injuries 
the plaintiffs attorneys from south carolina have also represented foreign banana workers in the texas and mississippi matters discussed below 
for the last seven years  the focus of the case has been on procedural issues 
the defendants moved to dismiss under the doctrine of forum non conveniens 
under this doctrine  the foreign plaintiffs would have to sue in their own countries rather than using the united states courts 
the plaintiffs wish to keep the cases in the united states and have them remanded to state court 
the plaintiffs also contend that the federal court does not have jurisdiction 
in september  the court granted defendants motion to dismiss based on the grounds of forum non conveniens 
a number of conditions were imposed including consent to jurisdiction in the four foreign countries for the ten named plaintiffs  use of discovery taken in the united states  the requirement that the plaintiffs file suits in their home countries by december   and the agreement by defendants to pay any judgment  if any  that might be entered in the foreign countries 
the court order also provided that the plaintiffs could return to the united states if the foreign countries refused to accept jurisdiction 
the court then dismissed the case on march  the plaintiffs subsequently appealed to the ninth circuit court of appeal 
the ninth circuit issued its decision on may   holding that the federal court did not have jurisdiction 
a petition for writ of certiorari a writ of a superior court to call up the records of an inferior court or quasi judicial body was filed in united states supreme court on october  and the united states supreme court subsequently granted a hearing 
oral argument was held on january  on april   the united states supreme court issued its decision in favor of the plaintiffs  holding there was no jurisdiction in federal court 
this vacates the order dismissing the case under the forum non conveniens doctrine 
one september   the us district court in honolulu issued an order that the case will be remanded to state court unless there is an objection filed by september  as the us supreme court has issued its final decision on the lack of federal court jurisdiction  the case will be remanded to state 
once the case reaches state court  the defendants will have to decide whether they will file a motion to dismiss under forum non conveniens pursuant to state court procedures 
no activity took place on this case throughout or to date as apparently  the suit has not been officially received in the state court upon remand 
the plaintiffs attorneys reported that the ten plaintiffs filed suit in their home countries by december   
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries alleging in excess of two million united states dollars  per plaintiff 
the suit in guatemala was served on amvac in march  but no defendant has been required to answer 
suits in the other countries have not been served 
amvac has engaged local attorneys in the countries to defend these foreign suits 
no discovery has taken place on the individual claims of the plaintiffs 
it is too early to provide any evaluation of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome at this time 
without such discovery  it is unknown whether any of the plaintiffs was exposed to amvac brand dbcp or what statute of limitation defenses may apply 
amvac intends to contest the cases vigorously 
on or about october   the company was indirectly advised of a possible claim for ground water contamination on the island of maui 
this is separate and distinct from item a above 
the company was provided with communications between maui land pineapple company  inc maui pine and hawaii water service company hwsc 
hwsc is a non municipally owned public water utility owning three water wells allegedly contaminated with dbcp and  tri chloropropane tcp

on or about october   all parties agreed to a tolling of the applicable statute of limitations in order to enter into mediation proceedings 
the company has been advised that the total claim could approximate four million dollars  inclusive of future expenses for operations and maintenance of filtration devices on the wells 
the parties met with an independent mediator on january and  to discuss this claim 
on january   the company reached a settlement with hwsc for fifty five thousand dollars  contingent upon obtaining a court order approving the settlement as one made in good faith 
the settlement includes future expenses for operations and maintenance 
as not all parties settled at the mediation  hwsc filed suit in the circuit court of the second circuit  state of hawaii on february  the non settling parties subsequently removed the case to federal court  which has delayed the filing of motions in state court to approve the settlement as one made in good faith 
the case was remanded to state court on january  with the case back in state court  a motion for approval of the good faith settlement will be made 
once the court approves the settlement  the fifty five thousand dollars  will be paid to hwsc to conclude amvac s involvement

each case alleged damages sustained from injuries caused by plaintiffs who are former banana workers and citizens of a central american country exposure to dbcp while applying the product in their native countries 
these cases have been removed to us district court for the southern district of mississippi  southern division 
the federal court granted defense motions to dismiss in each case pursuant to the doctrine of forum non conveniens 
unlike the patrickson case  the court did not establish detailed procedures or deadlines for the filing of suits in the foreign countries by the five plaintiffs 
defendants have learned that plaintiff valentin valdez has filed a suit in panama  but they 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries have not been served 
on january   the court issued an unpublished decision  finding that there was jurisdiction in federal court  but remanded just one case espinola back to the trial court to determine if a stipulation which limited the plaintiff s recovery to fifty thousand dollars  was binding 
if the stipulation is binding  that case will be remanded to state court 
if the stipulation is not binding  that case will be dismissed along with the others  requiring the plaintiffs to litigate in their native countries 
a deposition of the plaintiff espinola was scheduled but was never taken

amvac chemical corporation et 
al 
other named defendants are dow chemical company  occidental chemical corporation  shell oil company  standard fruit  dole food  chiquita brands  tela railroad company  compania palma tica  and del monte fresh produce 
american vanguard corporation is not named as a defendant 
these suits were filed in  they were not served until november these complaints were filed in association with the same attorneys who have handled the delgado and carcamo matters listed below 
the complaints allege personal injuries from alleged exposure to dbcp punitive damages are also sought 
the plaintiffs approximately three thousand nine hundred are primarily from the countries of the philippines  costa rica  ecuador and guatemala 
in november  the cases were removed to the united states district court for the eastern district of louisiana 
the plaintiffs filed a motion to remand the cases back to the state court in december in february  the plaintiffs attorneys withdrew their motion to remand the cases to state court without prejudice  stating that they would wait for an appellate court determination on similar issues in the mississippi and texas cases 
dow chemical company  shell oil company and occidental chemical corporation contend that the vast majority of these plaintiffs were included in the settlement of some fifteen thousand plaintiffs mentioned in the delgado and carcamo matters discussed below 
in september  the plaintiffs attorneys finally evaluated their list of plaintiffs who had settled previously 
they agreed that the plaintiffs who settled with dow chemical company  shell oil company  and occidental chemical corporation were now only proceeding against the grower defendants 
the plaintiffs who had not settled previously would continue with the suit against all defendants  including amvac 
thus  out of the approximately three thousand nine hundred plaintiffs  about three hundred and fourteen are left one hundred and sixty seven are from ecuador  one hundred and two are from costa rica and forty five are from guatemala 
the plaintiffs filed a consolidated third amended complaint in october with soriano as the lead case 
each plaintiff seeks in excess of the minimum jurisdiction of federal court for diversity of citizenship cases  seventy five thousand dollars 
amvac has answered the third amended complaint 
with the united states supreme court holding there was no federal court jurisdiction in the patrickson case  the federal court judge issued an order to the parties in april as to why the cases should not be remanded to state court 
the defendants argued that there was still federal court jurisdiction because of diversity of citizenship  but this diversity did not exist at the time the suites were originally filed in and accordingly  the court remanded the cases to state court in june in state court  the three cases were assigned to two different judges 
the defendants considered filing another motion to dismiss based on forum non conveniens 
in louisiana  all defendants must join in making such a motion 
by this time  unfavorable anti forum non conveniens laws had passed or were pending in several of the 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries countries where the plaintiffs resided 
several of the defendants were against consenting to jurisdiction in those countries  which is a condition required by an order of dismissal under forum non conveniens 
as a result  these cases will now be litigated in state court in louisiana 
the state court has not yet scheduled any case management or status conferences 
it is likely that the three cases will be reconsolidated in state court 
no activity took place on this matter throughout or to date 
as in the other banana worker s cases  no discovery has taken place on the individual claims of the plaintiffs 
thus  it is unknown as to how many of the plaintiffs claim exposure to amvac s product and whether their claims are barred by applicable statutes of limitation 
amvac intends to vigorously contest these cases 
it is too early to provide any evaluation of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome at this time 
d 
texas matters these matters involve an earlier round of litigation by foreign banana workers 
the complaints filed in the united states court of appeals  fifth circuit entitled franklin rodriquez delgado  et al  jorge colindres carcamo  individually and on behalf of all other similarly situated  et al  juan ramon valdez  et al  and isae carcamo v 
shell oil company  et al 
the complaints are for personal injuries from alleged exposure to dbcp 
amvac was not sued by the plaintiffs but was sued on a third party complaint by dow chemical company 
these cases were originally filed in various state courts in texas and removed by the defendants to federal court 
by order dated july   the united states district court granted defendants motion to dismiss pursuant to the doctrine of forum non conveniens  requiring the plaintiffs to sue in their native countries 
the court required the defendants to consent to jurisdiction in the foreign countries along with other conditions 
as amvac had not been sued by the plaintiffs directly  it refused to consent to jurisdiction in the foreign countries for these plaintiffs 
in  dow chemical company dismissed its third party complaint against amvac without prejudice 
subsequently  dow chemical company and shell oil company settled with these plaintiffs as well as with about fifteen thousand other banana workers represented by the plaintiffs law firm not the firm representing the patrickson and mississippi plaintiffs 
dow chemical company was then dismissed by the plaintiffs with prejudice in september two intervenors who are represented by the same attorneys as the plaintiffs in the patrickson and mississippi cases have filed a motion in opposition to this dismissal 
the plaintiffs appealed to the fifth circuit on the order of dismissal under forum non conveniens 
in october  the fifth circuit found federal court jurisdiction and affirmed the dismissals based on forum non conveniens 
the united states supreme court refused to accept a hearing at that time 
while amvac is not presently a party in this lawsuit having been dismissed without prejudice  the case is still pending  with the focus now shifted to the grower defendants 
these remaining claims are apparently now being remanded to state courts in texas 
e 
nicaragua matters in march  twenty five plaintiffs  all residents of nicaragua  filed suit in state court in los angeles county  california  claiming personal injuries from alleged exposure to dbcp while working on banana plantations in their home country 
the complaint is entitled tellez et al v 
dole food company  inc et al 
the named defendants are dole food company  inc  dole fresh fruit company  standard fruit company  standard fruit and steamship company  dow chemical company  and amvac 
american vanguard corporation is not named as a defendant 
punitive damages are also sought against all defendants 
the plaintiffs claim personal injuries for sterility  reduced sperm counts and other reproductive injuries 
they claim exposure from working on banana plantations in nicaragua from dermal contact with dbcp  inhalation of vapors  and from drinking water allegedly contaminated with dbcp 
amvac was served with the complaint on april  and filed an answer on may  on may   dow chemical removed the case from state court to the united states district court for the central district of california 
the case was subsequently remanded to state court 
on september   the plaintiffs were permitted to file an amended complaint that dropped seven plaintiffs and added eighteen others  for a total of thirty six plaintiffs 
to date  the parties have worked on a comprehensive case 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries management order that would permit obtaining plaintiffs medical records in nicaragua and starting depositions of eighteen of the plaintiffs in los angeles and independent medical examination scheduled to take place in may at a status conference on february   a trial date for july  was scheduled 
no discovery has yet taken place on the individual claims of the plaintiffs 
thus  it is unknown as to how many of the thirty six plaintiffs  if any  actually claim exposure to amvac s product  the nature and extent of their injuries  and whether their claims are barred by applicable statutes of limitation 
amvac intends to vigorously contest this case 
it is too early to provide any evaluation of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome at this time 
in january  three new cases were filed in nicaragua 
this time defendants besides dow chemical company  shell oil company and dole food were sued  including amvac  occidental chemical corporation  del monte fresh produce  chiquita brands  ameribrom and three chevron entities 
it is reported that these plaintiffs claim damages for sterility and that there are approximately three hundred and fifty plaintiffs named in these three cases 
it has also been reported that a suit seeking damages for personal injuries based on alleged exposure to dbcp in groundwater has been filed in nicaragua 
amvac has not been served to date and has not seen the complaints 
amvac disputes that the nicaraguan courts have jurisdiction over it 
amvac intends to vigorously contest these cases 
it is too early to provide any evaluation of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome at this time 
other matters the company may be  from time to time  involved in other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its business 
the results of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty 
the company has and will continue to expend resources and incur expenses in connection with these proceedings 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in these proceedings 
while the company continually evaluates insurance levels for product liability  property damage and other potential areas of risk  an adverse determination in one or more of these proceedings could subject the company to significant liabilities  which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and operating results

weather patterns can have an impact on the company s operations

fin guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirement for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the following is a summary of the company s agreements that the company has determined is within the scope of fin under its bylaws and written indemnification agreements  the company has agreed to indemnify its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences arising as a result of the officer or director s serving in such capacity 
the term of the indemnification period is for the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited 
however  the company has a directors and officers liability insurance policy that reduces its exposure and enables it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
as a result of its insurance policy coverage  the company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal and has no liability recorded for these agreements as of december  the company enters into indemnification provisions under its agreements with other companies in its ordinary course of business typically customers 
under these provisions the company generally indemnifies and holds harmless the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of the company s activities or  in some cases  as a result of the indemnified party s activities under the agreement 
the indemnification provisions may survive the termination of the underlying agreement

the act provides for a special one time tax deduction of of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated as defined in the act in either an enterprise s last tax year that began before the enactment date  or the first tax year that begins during the one year period beginning on the date of enactment

foreign exchange management does not believe that the fluctuation in the value of the dollar in relation to the currencies of its customers in the last three fiscal years has adversely affected the company s ability to sell products at agreed upon prices denominated in us dollars 
no assurance can be given  however  that adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations will not occur in the future 
should adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations occur in geographies where the company sells exports its products  management is not certain such fluctuations will materially impact the company s operating results 
inflation management believes inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations during the past three years 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries critical accounting policies certain of the company s policies require the application of judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
these judgments are based on historical experience  terms of existing contracts  commonly accepted industry practices and other assumptions that the company believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s critical accounting polices and estimates include revenue recognition revenue from sales is recognized at the time title and the risks of ownership passes 
this is when the customer has made the fixed commitment to purchase the goods  the products are shipped per the customers instructions  the sales price is determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
long lived assets the carrying value of long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
measurement of the impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset 
generally  fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows 
property  plant and equipment and depreciation property  plant and equipment includes the cost of land  buildings  machinery and equipment  office furniture and fixtures  automobiles  and construction projects and significant improvements to existing plant and equipment 
interest costs related to significant construction projects may be capitalized at the company s weighted average cost of capital 
expenditures for maintenance and minor repairs are expensed as incurred 
when property or equipment is sold or otherwise disposed of  the related cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the respective accounts and the gain or loss realized on disposition is reflected in earnings 
all plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight line method  utilizing estimated useful property lives 
building lives range from to years  machinery and equipment lives range from to years  office furniture and fixture lives range from to years  automobile lives range from to years  construction projects and significant improvements to existing plant and equipment lives range from to years when placed in service 
foreign currency translation assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries  where the local currency is the functional currency  have been translated at year end exchange rates and profit and loss accounts have been translated using weighted average yearly exchange rates 
adjustments resulting from translation have been recorded in the equity section of the balance sheet as cumulative translation adjustments in other comprehensive income 
the effect of foreign currency exchange gains and losses on transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the entity s functional currency are remeasured into the functional currency using the end of the period exchange rates 
the effects of remeasurement related to foreign currency transactions are included in current profit and loss accounts 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries goodwill and other intangible assets the primary identifiable intangible assets of the company relate to product rights associated with its product acquisitions 
the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 identifiable intangibles with finite lives are amortized and those with indefinite lives are not amortized 
the estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset to the company is based upon a number of factors including the effects of demand  competition  and expected changes in the marketability of the company s products 
the company tests identifiable intangible assets for impairment at least annually  relying on a number of factors including operating results  business plans and future cash flows 
identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate elements of property 
the impairment test for identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount 
an impairment loss  if any  is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis  which requires the company to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset s being tested for impairment as well as select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows 
when determining future cash flow estimates  the company considers historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions 
estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by the company in such areas as future economic conditions  industry specific conditions  product pricing and necessary capital expenditures 
the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts or none at all for long lived assets  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
as of january   the company had an immaterial amount of goodwill and amortization related to the goodwill 
as such  the adoption of sfas  did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
risk factors the company s business may be adversely affected by cyclical and seasonal effects 
the chemical industry in general is cyclical and demands for its products tend to be slightly seasonal 
seasonal usage follows varying agricultural seasonal patterns  weather conditions and weather related pressure from pests  and customer marketing programs and requirements 
weather patterns can have an impact on the company s operations 
the end user of some of its products may  because of weather patterns  delay or intermittently disrupt field work during the planting season which may result in a reduction of the use of some products and therefore may reduce our revenues and profitability 
there can be no assurance that the company will adequately address any adverse seasonal effects 
the industry in which the company does business is extremely competitive and its business may suffer if the company is unable to compete effectively 
generally  the treatment against pests of any kind is broad in scope  there being more than one way or one product for treatment  eradication  or suppression 
the company faces competition from many domestic and foreign manufacturers  marketers and distributors participating in its marketplace 
competition in the marketplace is based primarily on efficacy  price  safety and ease of application 
many of the company s competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial and technical resources 
the company s ability to compete depends on its ability to develop additional applications for its current products  and to expand its product lines and customer base 
the company competes principally on the basis of the quality of its products  and the technical service and support given to its customers 
there can be no assurance that the company will compete successfully with existing competitors or with any new competitors 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries if the company is unable to successfully position itself in smaller niche markets  its business may be materially adversely affected 
the company has attempted to position itself in smaller niche markets that have been or are being abandoned by larger chemical companies 
these types of markets tend not to attract larger chemical companies due to the smaller volume demand 
as a result  larger chemical companies have been divesting themselves of products that fall into such smaller niche markets 
these smaller niche markets require significant and intensive management input and ongoing product research and are near product maturity 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in these smaller niche markets or  if it is successful in one or more niche markets  that it will continue to be successful in such niche markets 
the manufacturing of the company s products is subject to governmental regulations 
the company operates two manufacturing facilities one in los angeles  california and the other in axis  alabama the facilities 
the facilities operate under the terms and conditions imposed by required licenses and permits by state and local authorities 
the manufacturing of key ingredients for the company s products occurs at the facilities 
an inability to renew or maintain a license or permit or if the fees for such licenses or permits were increased significantly  wither would impede the company s access to key ingredients and the cost of production would increase  either of which would materially and adversely affect the company s ability to provide its products in a timely and affordable manner 
the distribution and sale of the company s products are subject to prior governmental approvals and thereafter ongoing governmental regulation 
the company s products are subject to laws administered by federal  state and foreign governments  including regulations requiring registration  approval and labeling of its products 
the labeling requirements restrict the use of and type of application for our products 
more stringent restrictions could make our products less desirable which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
substantially all of the company s products are subject to the epa registration and re registration requirements  and are conditionally registered in accordance with the fifra 
such registration requirements are based  among other things  on data demonstrating that the product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment when used according to approved label directions 
all states where any of the company s products are used also require registration before they can be marketed or used in that state 
governmental regulatory authorities have required  and may require in the future  that certain scientific data requirements be performed on the company s products 
the company  on its behalf and in joint efforts with other registrants  have and are currently furnishing certain required data relative to its products 
under fifra  the federal government requires registrants to submit a wide range of scientific data to support us registrations 
this requirement has significantly increased the company s operating expenses in such areas as testing and the production of new products 
the company expects such increases to continue in the future 
because scientific analyses are constantly improving  it cannot be determined with certainty whether or not new or additional tests may be required by regulatory authorities 
responding to such requirements may cause delays in the sales of our products which delays would adversely affect our profitability 
while fifra good laboratory practice standards specify the minimum practices and procedures which must be followed in order to ensure the quality and integrity of data related to these tests submitted to the us epa  there can be no assurance the epa will not request certain tests or studies be repeated
