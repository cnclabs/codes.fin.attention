overview the company believes that its operating results have largely been a result of its business strategy of investing in submarkets that provide the greatest potential for rental growth at the lowest relative risk 
essex believes that its market research process  which includes an analysis of both metropolitan statistical areas msas and submarkets  provides it with a distinct competitive advantage 
essex researches markets by reviewing data from private and government sources as well as information developed or verified by its field personnel 
essex then utilizes its proprietary research model to project market rent trends  allowing the company to allocate capital to the markets with the best risk adjusted return potential 
essex s research process begins with a macro economic analysis of various msas  followed by an evaluation of the submarkets within that msa 
the objective of the economic research department is to estimate the amount of new demand for housing  comparing it to the number of single family and multifamily homes being constructed within a submarket 
historically  markets with demand for multifamily housing that is greater than supply generate increasing occupancy levels and growth in rents 
key components of essex s analysis are as follows job growth the company believes that quality job growth will lead to demand for multifamily and for sale housing 
based on a variety of considerations  the company estimates how the total demand for housing will be allocated between rental and for sale housing 
housing supply limited housing supply  both rental and for sale  is a very important factor in maintaining high occupancy levels  particularly in periods of recession or slow economic growth 
the company seeks to identify markets in which there is a low level of housing construction  measured as a percentage of existing housing stock 
cost of for sale housing the company prefers areas with relatively expensive for sale housing  which is usually caused by an insufficient amount of single family housing construction 
the company seeks to identify areas where the cost of rent is low relative to both median income levels and the cost of homeownership 
demographic trends the company evaluates areas with long term positive immigration and demographic trends  and areas that provide an attractive quality of life 
based on its evaluation of multifamily housing supply and demand factors  the company forecasts the occupancy and rent trends for its targeted submarkets  and actively seeks to expand its multifamily portfolio in the submarkets with the greatest risk adjusted return 
by region  the company s operating results and investment strategy are as follows southern california region at the time of the company s initial public offering ipo  the company had ownership interests in this region representing of its multifamily units 
following the ipo  the company  using its research process  determined that various markets in the southern california region were attractive for multifamily property investment and  accordingly  the company increased its ownership in such markets 
as of december   we had ownership interests in this region representing of our multifamily units 
during the year ended december   the region continued to perform well  with same property revenues increasing by as compared to the company expects this region to generate positive rent growth of approximately in northern california region as of december   the company had ownership interests in this region representing of its multifamily units 
in  same property revenues decreased as compared to the company expects market rents to increase by approximately in as a result  the company will begin to increase its investment focus in this region 
pacific northwest region as of december   the company had ownership interests in this region representing of its multifamily units 
this region created jobs in  and same property revenues increased by as compared to the company expects continued job growth  lending to rental revenue growth of approximately in accounting changes variable interest entities in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
revised fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin r established new measurement techniques to evaluate whether entities should be consolidated in accordance with accounting research bulletin arb no 
 consolidated financial statements 
fin r defined variable interest entities vies  in which equity investors lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
as of january   the company adopted the provisions of fin r using the retroactive restatement approach  and amounts have been restated for the years ended december  and to reflect the adoption of fin r 
based on our analysis of fin r  the company consolidated essex management corporation emc  essex fidelity i corporation efc  down reit limited partnerships comprising ten properties  an office building that is subject to loans made by the company  and the multifamily improvements owned by a third party in which the company owns the land underlying these improvements and from which the company receives fees  including land lease  subordination and property management fees 
the company consolidated these entities because it is deemed the primary beneficiary under fin r 
the company s total assets and liabilities related to these vies  net of intercompany eliminations  were approximately million and million  respectively  at december  and million and million  respectively  at december  the down reit entities that collectively own ten multifamily properties  units were investments made under arrangements whereby emc became the general partner  the operating partnership became a special limited partner  and the other limited partners were granted rights of redemption for their interests 
such limited partners can request to be redeemed and the company can elect to redeem their rights for cash or by issuing shares of its common stock on a one share per unit basis 
conversion values will be based on the market value of the company s common stock at the time of redemption multiplied by the number of units stipulated under the above arrangements 
the other limited partners receive distributions based on the company s current dividend rate times the number of units held 
at december   the maximum number of shares that could be issued to meet redemption of these down reit entities is  as of december  and december   the carrying value of the other limited partners interests is presented at their historical cost and is classified within minority interests in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
interest holders in vies consolidated by the company are allocated a priority of net income equal to the cash payments made to those interest holders for services rendered or distributions from cash flow 
the remaining results of operations are generally allocated to the company 
properties consolidated in accordance with fin r were encumbered by third party  non recourse loans totaling million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
during  the company entered into two new arrangements that are deemed to be vies the entity that purchased the essex at lake merritt property as discussed in item dispositions  is a vie 
the company s participating loan to the entity  while representing a variable interest  does not result in the company being the primary beneficiary 
the joint venture the company entered into to develop a story building in los angeles  california as discussed in item development  is an entity in which the company is the primary beneficiary  and the joint venture was consolidated as of december  as of december  the company is involved with two vies in which the company is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary 
total assets and liabilities of these entities as of december  were approximately million and million  respectively 
the company does not have a significant exposure to loss resulting from its involvement with these unconsolidated vies 
stock based compensation as of january   the company adopted the fair value method of accounting for its stock based compensation plans using the retroactive restatement method as provided by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
under the fair value method  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is expensed over the vesting period 
stock based compensation expense under the fair value method for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
the fair value of stock options granted for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively  and was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants stock price risk free interest rates expected lives years years years volatility dividend yield reconciliation to previously reported amounts the accounting effect of adopting fin r and sfas on net income previously reported for the years ended december  and is as follows dollars in thousands  except per share amounts net income available to common stockholders previously reported adjustment for effect of adopting sfas adjustment for effect of adopting fin revised net income available to common stockholders as reported per common share data basic per share as previously reported adjustment for effect of adopting sfas adjustment for effect of adopting fin revised per basic share as reported diluted per share as previously reported adjustment for effect of adopting sfas adjustment for effect of adopting fin revised per diluted share as reported the accounting effect of adopting fin r and sfas on stockholders equity at january  for previously reported amounts is as follows dollars in thousands additional paid in capital distribution in excess of accumulated earnings statement of stockholders equity balance at january   as previously reported adjustments for cumulative effect on prior years of retroactively applying sfas adjustments for cumulative effect on prior years of retroactively applying fin revised balance at january   as adjusted depreciation beginning in  the company implemented an upgrade to its subsidiary ledger for accounting for fixed assets 
the company completed this system upgrade in the first quarter of in conjunction with this system upgrade  the company has determined that cumulative depreciation expense generated by consolidated or equity method rental properties was understated by approximately million through december  and this amount was recorded during the quarter ended march  had the correction been made in  depreciation expense would have increased by approximately  million  and million in the first  second and third quarters of  respectively 
in the fourth quarter  depreciation expense would have decreased by approximately million 
the company does not believe that the correction is material to any previously reported financial statements and is not material to any consolidated earnings trends 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we define critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that require our management to exercise their most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
our critical accounting policies relate principally to the following key areas i consolidation under applicable accounting standards of various entities  ii assessing the carrying values of our real estate properties and investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates  iii internal cost capitalization  iiii and qualification as a reit 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience  current market conditions  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from those estimates made by management 
the company assesses each entity in which it has an investment or contractual relationship to determine if it may be deemed to be a vie 
if such an entity is a vie  then the company analyzes the expected losses and expected residual returns to determine who is the primary beneficiary 
if the company is the primary beneficiary  then the entity is consolidated 
the analysis required to identify vies and primary beneficiaries is complex and judgmental  and the analysis must be applied to various types of entities and legal structures 
rental properties are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation components on rental properties have been provided over estimated useful lives ranging from to years using the straight line method 
development costs include acquisition  direct and indirect construction costs  interest and real estate taxes incurred during the construction and property stabilizations periods 
maintenance and repair expenses that do not add to the value or prolong the useful life of the property are expensed as incurred 
asset replacements and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
the company assesses the carrying value of its real estate investments by monitoring investment market conditions and performance compared to budget for operating properties and joint ventures  and by monitoring estimated costs for properties under development 
local market knowledge and data is used to assess carrying values of properties and the market value of acquisition opportunities 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property held for investment may not be fully recoverable  the carrying amount is evaluated 
if the sum of the property s expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the property  then the company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the property 
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of real estate investments could result in impairment charges 
when the company determines that a property is held for sale  it discontinues the periodic depreciation of that property 
the criteria for determining when a property is held for sale requires judgment and has potential financial statement impact as depreciation would cease and an impairment loss could occur upon determination of held for sale status 
assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell 
with respect to investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates  the company looks to the underlying properties to assess performance and the recoverability of carrying amounts for those investments in a manner similar to direct investments in real estate properties 
an impairment charge or investment valuation charge is recorded if the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value 
the company capitalizes all direct and certain indirect costs  including interest and real estate taxes  incurred during development and redevelopment activities 
interest is capitalized on real estate assets that require a period of time to get them ready for their intended use 
the amount of interest capitalized is based upon the average amount of accumulated development expenditures during the reporting period 
included in capitalized costs are management s estimates of the direct and incremental personnel costs and indirect project costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities 
indirect project costs consist primarily of personnel costs associated with construction administration and development accounting  legal fees  and various office costs that clearly relate to projects under development 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may vary from those estimates and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions

potential factors affecting future operating results many factors affect the company s actual financial performance and may cause the company s future results to be different from past performance or trends 
these factors include those set forth under the caption risk factors in item i of this annual report on form k and the following economic environment and impact on operating results both the national economy and the economies of the western states in which the company owns  manages and develops properties  some of which are concentrated in high tech sectors  have been and may be in an economic downturn 
the impacts of such downturns on operating results can include  and are not limited to  reduction in rental rates  occupancy levels  property valuations and increases in operating costs such as advertising  turnover and repair and maintenance expense 
the company s property type and diverse geographic locations provide some degree of risk moderation but are not immune to a prolonged down cycle in the real estate markets in which the company operates 
although the company believes it is well positioned to meet the challenges ahead  it is possible that reductions in occupancy and market rental rates will result in a reduction of rental revenues  operating income  cash flows  and market value of the company s shares 
prolonged recession could also affect the company s ability to obtain financing at acceptable rates of interest and to access funds from the refinance or disposition of properties at acceptable prices 
interest rate fluctuations the company monitors changes in interest rates and believes that it is well positioned from both a liquidity and interest rate risk perspective 
however  current interest rates are at historic lows and potentially could increase rapidly to levels more in line with historic levels 
the immediate effect of significant and rapid interest rate increases would be higher interest expense on the company s variable interest rate debt see item a and notes and to consolidated financial statements 
the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact the company s ability to make acquisitions and develop properties at economic returns on investment and the company s ability to refinance existing borrowings at acceptable rates 
inflation deflation substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses 
the company believes it effectively manages its property and other expenses but understands that substantial annual rates of inflation or deflation could adversely impact operating results 
failure to qualify as a reit we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code 
however  we cannot assure you that we have qualified as a reit or that we will continue to so qualify in the future 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates 
we may also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify 
this would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability 
even if we continue to qualify as a reit  we will continue to be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and property 
funds from operations funds from operations is a financial measure that is commonly used in the reit industry 
essex presents funds from operations as a supplemental performance measure 
funds from operations is not used by essex as  nor should it be considered to be  an alternative to net earnings computed under gaap as an indicator of essex s operating performance or as an alternative to cash from operating activities computed under gaap as an indicator of essex s ability to fund its cash needs 
funds from operations is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present  nor does essex intend it to present  a complete picture of its financial condition and operating performance 
essex believes that net earnings computed under gaap remains the primary measure of performance and that funds from operations is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings 
further  essex believes that its consolidated financial statements  prepared in accordance with gaap  provide the most meaningful picture of its financial condition and its operating performance 
in calculating funds from operations  essex follows the definition for this measure published by the national association of reits nareit  which is a reit trade association 
essex believes that  under the nareit funds from operation definition  the two most significant adjustments made to net income are i the exclusion of historical cost depreciation and ii the exclusion of gains and losses from the sale of previously depreciated properties 
essex agrees that these two nareit adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons a historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap assumes  through depreciation charges  that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
nareit stated in its white paper on funds from operations since real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
consequently  nareit s definition of funds from operations reflects the fact that real estate  as an asset class  generally appreciates over time and depreciation charges required by gaap do not reflect the underlying economic realities 
b reits were created as a legal form of organization in order to encourage public ownership of real estate as an asset class through investment in firms that were in the business of long term ownership and management of real estate 
the exclusion  in nareit s definition of funds from operations  of gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the long term assets that form the core of a reit s activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods 
other reits in calculating funds from operations may vary from the nareit definition for this measure  and thus their disclosure of funds from operations may not be comparable to essex s calculation 
the following table sets forth the company s calculation of funds from operations for through for the year ended for the quarter ended net income adjustments depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization unconsolidated co investments gain on sale of real estate

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its line of credit and long term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the company s real estate investment portfolio and operations 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives the company borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the company s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows 
management believes that the carrying amounts of its libor debt approximates fair value as of december  because interest rates  yields and other terms for these instruments are consistent with yields and other terms currently available to the company for similar instruments 
management has estimated that the fair value of the company s  of fixed rate mortgage notes payable at december  is approximately  based on the terms of existing mortgage notes payable compared to those available in the marketplace 
for the years ended december in thousands thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate libor debt average interest rate  subject to interest rate caps 
the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss  with respect to interest rate fluctuations  would depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at the time  and interest rates
