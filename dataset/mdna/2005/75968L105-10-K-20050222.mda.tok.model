item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview renaissance learning  inc is a leading provider of learning information systems software and school improvement programs to pre kindergarten through senior high pre k schools in north america 
our computer based learning information systems and related professional development  school improvement programs  consulting  and technical services help educators motivate students  accelerate learning  improve test scores  and help students master standards by increasing the quality  quantity  and timeliness of performance data available to educators to facilitate increased student practice of essential skills and to support instruction 
our sales are derived primarily from the sale of software products and related services 
revenues are recorded net of an allowance for estimated returns 
allowances for bad debts are also recorded at the time of the sale 
product revenue is derived primarily from the sale of software products 
we recognize revenue from sales of our perpetually licensed off the shelf software products at the time of shipment to customers 
revenue from subscription based products is recognized on a straight line basis over the subscription period 
we recognize revenue from the sale of software products which require significant customization or modification on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
service revenue is primarily derived from i training seminars  ii software telephone support agreements  iii consulting services  and iv technical services 
revenue from training seminars is recognized when the seminar or workshop is performed 
revenue from consulting and technical services is recognized as the services are performed or on a straight line basis over the contractual period 
telephone support included with sales of perpetual software licenses has a duration of twelve months or less and is recognized at the time the software is shipped with the related costs of providing the telephone support accrued for at the same time 
revenue from other software support agreements is initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over or months depending on the term of the agreement 
deferred revenue includes i amounts invoiced for products not yet delivered and services not yet performed  ii advance invoicing on contracts  and iii that portion of software support agreements and subscription based product sales that has not yet been recognized as revenue 
because software products are generally shipped as orders are received  we have historically operated without a significant backlog of products 
however  it is our practice to announce new products prior to when the products are ready for shipment to allow customers sufficient lead time for budgeting and curriculum purposes 
this practice can result in fluctuations in backlog for orders of new products 
these orders are generally filled within a relatively short period of time after the product is ready for shipment 
registrations for training seminars are generally received from customers in advance of training events  resulting in a backlog for these services 
additionally  under district wide implementations  customers commit to a comprehensive solution consisting of software and services in advance of delivery of the products and services 
the delivery of backlogged products and services in certain periods can cause those periods to have higher revenue and higher revenue growth rates than other periods 
cost of sales consists of expenses associated with sales of software products and the delivery of services 
these costs include i personnel related costs  ii costs of purchased materials such as optical mark card scanners  educational products  training materials  manuals and motivational items  iii shipping and freight costs  iv amortization of capitalized development costs  and v other overhead costs 
we recognize higher gross margins on our software product sales than on our scanners and service sales 
we expense all development costs associated with a software product until technological feasibility is established  after which time such costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
capitalized product development costs are amortized into cost of sales when the product is available for general release using the straight line method over the estimated economic life of the product  which is generally estimated to be months 

table of contents in august  we purchased a start up enterprise in order to obtain a potential new product concept related to language acquisition software 
this in process technology was instrumental in the development of our new english in a flash language acquisition software  which was released in the fourth quarter of recent developments in january  a decision was made to divest our subsidiary  generation learning systems  which is a non core part of our business 
although we have not finalized plans for exiting this business  we have reduced our resources while ensuring that generation continues to meet its remaining customer commitments 
on january   we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire alphasmart  inc  a publicly traded company listed on the nasdaq national market under the symbol alsm 
we expect to close the transaction during the second quarter of the transaction is valued at approximately million 
alphasmart stockholders will have the option to be paid in cash  renaissance learning  inc common stock or some combination of the two  subject to pro ration so that the total consideration paid will aggregate no more than renaissance learning  inc common stock and no less than cash 
given the complementary nature of alphasmart s portable computing devices and our writing suite of products  we believe the merger enhances the opportunity to realize our strategic objective of achieving greater scale and presence in the writing segment of the k market 
on february   our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from 
per share to 
per share 
the board also authorized an additional three million shares under the stock re purchase program  bringing the total number of shares authorized for repurchase to million  million of which have been repurchased under prior authorization 
results of operations our annual results of operations can be influenced by  among other things  general economic factors and the related impact on state and federal budgetary policy 
school funding is typically a priority budget item and thus exhibits less volatility in economic downturns than other programs 
however  in highly recessionary periods or in periods of sustained economic slow down  curtailments in school funding can be significant 
the difficult educational funding environment in recent years has contributed to the revenue declines we experienced in and our results of operations for and have also been impacted by our new product and service offerings which are typically sold on a subscription basis with a term of twelve months 
because a greater portion of our revenue is now initially deferred and recognized into income over the subscription period  our revenue shows a greater decline than it would have if these products had been sold as perpetual licenses  for which the revenue is recognized immediately upon shipment 
during and  we have focused a greater proportion of our selling efforts on district level sales 
sales at a district level are more complex  have a longer sales cycle  and are typically for a larger dollar amount than sales made to individual schools 
thus  revenues from district sales can be more uneven and are more difficult to accurately predict 
consequently  our revenues and results of operations can be significantly impacted by the timing of large district orders 
the recent economic environment combined with the transition to subscription based revenues and district level selling have resulted in a decline in our results of operations for and we expect that our continued focus on solutions that accelerate learning and our efforts to establish a presence at the district level where more spending decisions will likely be made in the future  will return us to periods of revenue growth in the future 

table of contents the following table sets forth certain consolidated income statement data as a percentage of net sales  except that individual components of cost of sales and gross profit are shown as a percentage of their corresponding component of net sales for the years ended december  net sales products services total net sales cost of sales products services total cost of sales gross profit products services total gross profit operating expenses product development selling and marketing general and administrative operating income other  net income before taxes income tax provision net income years ended december  and net sales 
our net sales declined by million or  to million in from million in the lower sales can be attributed to two main factors  an increase in deferred revenue and an interruption of customer order patterns as a result of our new product offerings 
deferred revenue increased by million during the year  mainly due to our transition to a subscription based model for renaissance place and several newer service offerings 
we began to ship the new renaissance place versions of accelerated reader and accelerated math in may renaissance place  unlike our perpetually licensed versions  is a subscription based product that requires a significant portion of the sale to be initially recorded as deferred revenue and then recognized as revenue over the subscription period  typically months 
we believe the interruption in order patterns was caused by customers delaying their purchase decisions as they evaluate the new renaissance place versions of our software and by the longer sales cycles required when selling at the district level 
product sales decreased by million  or  to million in from million in service revenue decreased by  or  to million in compared to million in lower attendance at our national school renaissance conference held in the first quarter resulted in about  less revenue compared to our national school renaissance conference 
our onsite and hotel training revenues declined in the period  partially offset by some of our newer service offerings 
we 
table of contents continue to de emphasize our single event training offerings in favor of mentor coaching  consulting  and other services that we believe are more effective in helping educators to accelerate learning  thereby increasing customer satisfaction  resulting in greater long term success for our products and services 
service revenue declined partly because our new mentor coaching service is subscription based  which requires the revenue be deferred and recognized over the month subscription period 
late in the fourth quarter  we began shipping our newest product  english in a flash 
this software helps educators accelerate the language acquisition of english language learners ells and english as a second language esl students 
while the introduction of english in a flash did not have any significant impact on our revenue  we expect order activity for this product to increase considerably as the marketplace becomes more aware of this product 
cost of sales 
the cost of sales of products decreased by million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of product sales  the cost of sales of products decreased to from in the lower cost of sales was mainly due to lower scanner warranty costs  cost efficiencies achieved in the delivery of our custom assessment products and to the sales mix this year compared to last with proportionally lower sales of scanners  which is a lower gross profit margin product than our core software products 
the cost of sales of services was million in and as a percentage of sales of services  the cost of sales of services increased to in from in the increased percentage is mainly due to the costs of ramping up our new service offerings prior to their full utilization as well as lower attendance at our national school renaissance conference 
since most of the costs to host the conference are relatively fixed  the lower revenue directly affects profitability 
our overall gross profit margin improved to in from in driven by the factors disclosed above in the product cost of sales analysis 
product development 
product development expense  which excludes amounts capitalized  decreased slightly to million in from million in we continue to invest in the development of new products  enhancement of existing products including new platforms  and development of tools to increase the efficiency of product development 
we capitalized product development expenses of  in compared to  in selling and marketing

the net decrease is due primarily to 
table of contents i cash dividends paid of million  ii stock repurchases of million  and iii million invested in new property  plant and equipment offset by million in cash provided by operating activities and million from stock option exercises 
at december   we had a million unsecured revolving line of credit with a bank which is available until may  the line of credit bears interest at either a floating rate based on the prime rate less  or a fixed rate for a period of up to days based on libor plus 
the rate is at our option and is determined at the time of borrowing 
we also have a million unsecured revolving line of credit with a bank available until april  the line of credit bears interest based on the prime rate less 
as of december   the lines of credit had not been used 
on april   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our common stock 
on february   our board of directors authorized an additional three million shares under the stock repurchase program 
no time limit was placed on the duration of the repurchase program 
repurchased shares will become treasury shares and will be used for stock based employee benefit plans and for other general corporate purposes 
during the period of january  through december   we repurchased  shares at a cost of million 
since authorization  we have repurchased million shares at a cost of million under this repurchase program 
depending on our stock valuation  cash availability and other factors  we may repurchase additional shares as a beneficial use of our cash to enhance shareholder value 
we declared a special cash dividend of per share on january  and also declared quarterly cash dividends of 
per share for each of the four quarters of on february   our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from 
per share to 
per share 
we intend to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends  subject to capital availability and a determination that cash dividends continue to be in the best interests of the company and our shareholders 
we believe our strong cash position coupled with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet both our short term and long term working capital requirements including the cash required to acquire alphasmart  which is expected to close during the second quarter of off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations we do not have any off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  or obligations including contingent obligations  that would have a material effect on our financial results 
operating leases 
we enter into operating leases  primarily for facilities that we occupy in order to carry out our business operations 
we utilize operating leases for some of our smaller offices because they give us more flexibility than purchasing facilities outright and limit our exposure to many of the risks of owning commercial property  especially as it pertains to foreign jurisdictions 
these agreements generally are for terms of one to five years and cannot be terminated by either the lessor or us for reasons other than breach of the lease agreement 
we do not anticipate early termination of any of these agreements 
for each of the years ended december   and  we incurred expenses of approximately million  with respect to these operating leases 

table of contents as of december   our aggregate contractual obligations for future payments under these operating leases by period due were approximately in thousands after retirement plan 
we have established a supplemental executive retirement plan serp for the provision of retirement benefits to members of our senior management 
under the terms of the plan  participants elect to defer receipt of a portion of their compensation and to hypothetically invest it in certain mutual fund investments 
upon a participant s retirement or certain other events  the company has an obligation to repay the deferred compensation  a defined matching company contribution and the hypothetical market gain or loss of each participant s investment selections 
the serp is more fully described in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december  our aggregate contractual obligation for future payments under the serp are million  all of which are expected to be paid out sometime after other obligations 
as of december   we did not hold any long term debt obligations  capital lease obligations  or long term purchase obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the foregoing discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following is a list of our critical accounting policies defined as those policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and or require management s significant judgments and estimates 
this is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position no 
software revenue recognition issued by the accounting standards executive committee of the aicpa 
under this accounting standard  revenue is recognized when the following have occurred persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery and acceptance has occurred or a service has been performed  pricing is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
revenue is recognized as follows i at the time of shipment to customers for perpetually licensed off the shelf software products and related telephone support with a duration of months or less sold with the product  ii on the percentage of completion basis for software products which require significant customization or modification  iii as seminars are performed for training  iv straight line over the term of the support agreement for other software support agreements  v as the service is performed or on a straight line basis over the contractual period for technical and consulting services  and vi straight line over the subscription period for subscription based products 
accordingly  management is required to make judgments as to whether pricing is fixed and determinable  whether collectibility is reasonably assured and what the percentage of completion is as of the financial reporting date 
expenses are recognized and matched against revenues for the reporting period presented in the financial statements 
we record accruals for sales returns and doubtful accounts at the time of revenue recognition 
table of contents based upon historical experience as well as other factors that in our judgment could reasonably be expected to cause sales returns or doubtful accounts to differ from historical experience 
changes in such allowances may be required if future returns or bad debt activity differs from our estimates 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired 
management uses judgement when applying impairment rules to determine when an impairment test is necessary 
examples of factors which could trigger an impairment review include a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  and significant adverse changes in legal factors or the business climate that impact the value of an asset 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
estimating fair value requires that we forecast future cash flows related to the asset subject to review 
these forecasts require assumptions about demand for our products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
other assumptions include determining the discount rate and future growth rates 
changes to these assumptions could result in an impairment charge in future periods 
software support obligations 
we record a liability for the estimated cost of software support at the time of sale 
estimated costs are based upon our historical cost experience of fulfilling these obligations as well as other factors that in our judgment could reasonably be expected to affect those costs  such as trends in the cost of providing telephone support 
if the actual costs of fulfilling these obligations differ from our estimates  it could result in additional charges to cost of sales in future periods 
software development costs 
we capitalize certain software development costs incurred after technological feasibility is achieved 
capitalized software development costs are amortized on a product by product basis using the straight line method over the estimated economic life of the products  which is generally estimated to be months 
amortization begins when the products are available for general release to customers 
if the actual economic life of our products is shorter than our estimates  it could result in an impairment charge in future periods 
taxes 
at the end of each interim reporting period  we estimate the effective income tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year 
the estimated effective income tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned eg  united states compared to non united states  the estimated amount of certain tax credits  as well as tax planning strategies 
if the actual distribution of taxable income by jurisdiction varies from our expectations  if the actual amount of tax credits varies from our estimates  or if the results of tax planning strategies are different from our estimates  adjustments to the effective income tax rate may be required in the period such determination is made 
we record a liability for potential tax assessments based on our estimate of the potential exposure 
due to the subjectivity and complex nature of the underlying issues  actual payments or assessments may differ from our estimates and require tax provision adjustments in future periods 
recent accounting pronouncement in december  the fasb issued sfas r revised  share based payment 
this statement revises sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and requires companies to expense the value of employee stock option grants and similar awards 
the effective date of this standard is interim and annual periods beginning after june  historically  we have elected to follow the intrinsic value method of accounting for our employee stock options 
accordingly  because the exercise price of our employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  we have not recognized any compensation expense related to grants of stock options to our employees 

table of contents upon the adoption of sfas no 
r  we will expense stock option grants in our consolidated statement of income over the vesting period of the grants following the modified version of prospective application 
for the years ended december   and  total stock based employee compensation expense  net of related tax effects determined under this new standard  would have been  and million  respectively 
stock option expense in will be dependent on future awards  in addition to unvested awards at the date of adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market interest rate risk consists of i the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio  and ii the decrease or increase in value of our investment security portfolio if market interest rates increase or decrease  respectively 
we anticipate that we will have sufficient liquidity to hold our investments to maturity  therefore  we do not expect to recognize any material losses or gains related to an increase or decrease in market interest rates 
market risk 
our exposure to market risk relates to the quality of the holdings in our investment security portfolio 
the fair market value of our investments is subject to increases or decreases in value resulting from the performance of the securities issuer  from upgrades or downgrades in the credit worthiness of the securities issuer  and from changes in general market conditions 
we seek to manage our exposure to market risk by investing in accordance with our corporate investment policy as established by our board of directors 
the goals of the policy are i preservation of capital  ii provision of adequate liquidity to meet projected cash requirements  iii minimization of risk of principal loss through diversified short and medium term investments  and iv maximization of yields in relationship to the guidelines  risk  market conditions and tax considerations 
our investment policy specifically requires that i each investment have a maximum maturity of months  ii at least of the portfolio be available on days notice and not more than of the portfolio have a maturity in excess of months  iii each investment meet minimum credit quality requirements  iv our portfolio be diversified such that not more than is invested in any one issuer other than the us treasury or its agencies  or money market funds  and v each investment meet certain maximum maturity or tender option limits based on its minimum credit rating 
our investment policy generally precludes investment in equity securities except for the investment in funds for the purpose of hedging the market value exposure on the supplemental executive retirement plan see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
due to the type and duration of investments in our portfolio  we do not expect to realize any material gains or losses related to market risk 
as of december  our investment securities had a market value of approximately million and a carrying value of million 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are measured using local currency 
revenues and expenses of such subsidiaries have been translated into us dollars using average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
assets and liabilities have been translated at the rates of exchange on the balance sheet date 
translation gains or losses are deferred as a separate component of shareholders equity 
aggregate foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in determining net income 
as such  our operating results are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar compared to the australian dollar  british pound  canadian dollar  and indian rupee 
at this time  foreign exchange rate risk is not significant due to the relative size of our foreign operations
