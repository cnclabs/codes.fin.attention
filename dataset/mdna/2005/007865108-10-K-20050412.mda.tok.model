off balance sheet arrangements other than operating lease commitments set forth in the table above  we are not a party to any material off balance sheet financing arrangements 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions about future events that impact amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ materially from those estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
our accounting policies are described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following are our most critical accounting estimates that include significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments would be made when facts and circumstances require 
historically  we have found our application of accounting estimates to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those estimated merchandise inventory merchandise inventory consists of finished goods and is valued utilizing the cost method at lower of cost or market on a first in  first out basis 
we use estimates during interim periods to record a provision for inventory shortage 
we also make certain assumptions regarding future demand and net realizable selling price in order to assess that our inventory is recorded properly at the lower of cost or market 
these assumptions are based on both historical experience and current information 
we believe that the carrying value of merchandise inventory is appropriate at january  however  actual results may differ materially from those estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
defined benefit pension plan we maintain a supplemental executive retirement plan  which is a non qualified defined benefit plan for certain officers 
the plan is non contributory  not funded and provides benefits based on years of service and compensation during employment 
pension expense is determined using various actuarial cost methods to estimate the total benefits ultimately payable to officers  and this cost is allocated to service periods 
the actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension costs are reviewed annually 
we believe that these assumptions have been appropriate  and that based on these assumptions  the defined benefit retirement plan liability is appropriately stated at january  however  actual results may differ materially from those estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents finite lived assets we periodically evaluate the need to recognize impairment losses relating to long lived assets 
long lived assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may have been impaired 
in evaluating an asset for recoverability  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we would write the asset down to fair value and we would record an impairment charge  accordingly 
we believe that the carrying values of finite lived assets  and their useful lives  are appropriate at january  however  actual results may differ materially from those estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we record liabilities for tax contingencies when it is probable that a liability to a taxing authority has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated  based on past experience 
tax contingency liabilities are adjusted for changes in circumstances and additional uncertainties  such as significant amendments to existing tax law 
we believe that liabilities for tax contingencies are appropriately stated at january  however  actual results may differ materially from those estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting developments see the section recent accounting developments included in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting developments and their impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at january   we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility and we have not had any borrowings outstanding under our credit facility since november to the extent that we may borrow pursuant to our credit facility in the future  we may be exposed to market risk related to interest rate fluctuations 
additionally  we have not entered into financial instruments for hedging purposes
