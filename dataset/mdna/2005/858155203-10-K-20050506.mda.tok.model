item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to the consolidated financial statements 
north america segment our north america segment serves customers mainly through independent and owned dealers in over locations in the united states and canada 
each of our dealers maintains their own sales force which is complemented by our sales representatives who work closely with the dealers throughout the sales process 
no single independent dealer accounted for more than of our segment revenue for the five largest independent dealers collectively accounted for approximately of our segment revenue 
we do not believe our business is dependent on any single dealer  the loss of which would have a material effect upon our business 
however  temporary disruption of dealer coverage within a specific local market due to financial failure or the inability to smoothly transition ownership could temporarily have an adverse impact on our business within the affected market 
from time to time  we obtain a controlling interest in dealers that are undergoing an ownership transition 
it is typically our intent to sell these dealerships as soon as it is practical 
our offerings in the north america segment include furniture  architecture  and technology products  as described above  under the steelcase and turnstone brands 
in  the north america segment accounted for  or of our total revenue and had approximately  employees  approximately  of which are manufacturing employees 
the north america office furniture markets are highly competitive  with a number of competitors offering similar categories of product 
in these markets  companies compete on price  delivery and relationships with customers  architects and designers 
our most significant competitors in the united states are haworth  inc  herman miller  inc  hni corporation  kimball international  and knoll  inc together with steelcase  these companies represent approximately of the united states office furniture market 

table of contents steelcase design partnership segment the sdp segment is comprised of five brands focused on higher end design furniture products and niche applications 
each brand has its own competitors which are generally focused on a small group of specialized products 
designtex is focused on surface materials including textiles  wall covering  hand tufted rugs  shades  screens and surface imaging 
details designs and markets ergonomic tools and accessories for the workplace 
brayton  vecta  and metro each provide different furniture products  including solutions for lobby and reception areas  conference rooms  private offices  health care and learning environments 
the sdp segment markets and sells its products through many of the same dealers as the north america segment 
in  the sdp segment accounted for  or of our total revenue and had approximately  employees  approximately of which are manufacturing employees 
international segment our international segment serves customers outside of the united states and canada under the steelcase and sdp brands 
the international office furniture market is highly competitive and fragmented 
we compete with many different local or regional manufacturers in many different markets 
in most cases  these competitors focus their strengths on selected product categories 
the international segment has its most significant presence in europe where we have the leading market share 
the international segment serves customers through independent and company owned dealers in about locations 
in certain geographic markets the segment sells directly to customers 
in  our international segment accounted for  or of our total revenue and had approximately  employees  approximately  of which are manufacturing employees 
other category the other category currently includes our polyvision  ideo and financial services subsidiaries and unallocated corporate expenses 
polyvision corporation designs and manufactures visual communications products  such as static and electronic whiteboards 
the majority of polyvision s revenue relates to static whiteboards in the primary and secondary education markets 
polyvision primarily sells to general contractors through a direct bid process 
polyvision s remaining revenues are generated from electronic whiteboards sold through our north america dealer network and other audio visual resellers 
ideo inc provides product design and innovation services to companies in a variety of industries including computers  communications  healthcare  and manufacturing among others 
steelcase financial services inc provides leasing services to north america and sdp customers and selected financing services to our dealers 
approximately of corporate expenses for shared services are charged to the operating segments as part of a corporate allocation 
unallocated expenses are reported within the other category 
in  the other category accounted for  or of our total revenue 
customer and dealer concentrations our largest direct sale customer accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue and our five largest direct sell customers accounted for approximately of consolidated revenue 
however  these percentages do not include revenue from various government agencies and other entities purchasing under our general services administration contract  which in the aggregate accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue 
we do not believe our business is dependent on any single or small number of end use customers  the loss of which would have a material adverse effect upon our business 

table of contents no single independent dealer accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue for the five largest independent dealers collectively accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
global manufacturing and supply chain manufacturing and logistics historically  each of our segments  and in some cases  brands within segments  had their own dedicated manufacturing facilities 
in many cases  these plants were highly vertically integrated which helped us maintain control over our make to order system 
we invested in automation which improved labor productivity but also resulted in a relatively capital intensive operation with significant work in process inventories because of a batch and queue approach 
over the last several years  we have been migrating to a different industrial model based on lean principles which emphasize continuous one piece flow and discourages batch and queue 
moving to this approach has reduced the capital needs of the business  reduced inventories  and reduced the amount of floor space we need to produce product 
the migration to lean manufacturing along with the industry downturn created significant excess manufacturing capacity which we have started to eliminate over the last few years 
in  we had approximately million square feet of manufacturing facilities worldwide 
during fiscal years to  we have undergone significant restructuring driven by the need to reduce our excess capacity in response to lower industry demand 
at the end of we had reduced our square footage dedicated to manufacturing by million square feet to million square feet  and recently announced plans to further reduce square footage to million square feet over the next two years 
we currently manufacture our products in principal locations throughout the world 
see item properties for additional information regarding real estate held for sale and idle property 
we will continue to examine opportunities to consolidate manufacturing and distribution operations and dispose of assets that represent excess capacity 
the increased breadth of our product line over the last years has increased the number of manufacturing stock keeping units skus  which has increased the complexity and cost of many of our manufacturing operations 
the company has launched an initiative to streamline our product offerings and increase sales volume per sku to reduce complexity in our industrial system 
the next step in creating a more flexible industrial model is to move away from facilities dedicated to manufacturing for a single or limited number of geographic locations  and towards a global network of manufacturing  assembly and logistics operations and a global network of integrated suppliers that can serve customer needs across multiple brands and geographies 
in  we centralized our global manufacturing under a single organization to help achieve this goal 
this change had no impact on how our operating results are reviewed by our chief operating decision maker 
our physical distribution system in north america and europe utilizes both our company owned trucking fleet and commercial transport and delivery services 
in north america  we are in the process of establishing a number of regional distribution centers throughout the united states to reduce freight cost and improve service to customers and dealers 
raw materials and suppliers the company s manufacturing materials are available from a significant number of sources within north america  europe and asia 
to date  we have not experienced difficulties obtaining raw materials  which include steel and other metals  lumber  paper  paint  plastics  laminates  particleboard  veneers  glass  fabrics  leathers and upholstery filling material 
these raw materials are not unique to the industry nor are they rare 
steel and certain other commodity prices have significantly increased over the past months due to changes in global supply and demand 
although raw steel prices have moderated in recent months  they are still approximately twice as high as months ago 
there is 
table of contents some risk that these changes could lead to future supply interruptions although we do not expect nor have we experienced any such interruptions to date 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of raw materials prices 
research  design and development steelcase s extensive research a combination of user observations  feedback sessions and sophisticated network analysis has helped the company develop unique expertise in helping people work more effectively 
we team up with other innovators leading universities  think tanks and knowledge leaders to expand and deepen our understanding of how people work 
we also collaborate with ideo  our subsidiary that provides design and innovation services worldwide 
ideo has won over industrial design excellence awards sponsored by business week magazine  of which were for projects with steelcase or sdp 
understanding patterns of work enables us to identify and anticipate user needs 
our design teams develop prototypical solutions to address these needs 
these solutions are sometimes single products and or enhancements to existing products  and are sometimes integrated architecture  furniture and technology solutions 
design work is organizationally distributed across our major businesses and can involve outside design services 
our marketing team evaluates product concepts using several criteria  including financial return metrics  and chooses which products will be developed and launched 
next  designers work closely with our engineers and outside suppliers to co develop products and processes that lead to more efficient manufacturing while incorporating innovative user features 
products are tested for performance  quality and compliance with applicable standards and regulations 
exclusive of royalty payments  we have invested in research  design and development activities over the past three years 
royalties are sometimes paid to outside designers of our products as the products are sold and are not included in the research  design and development costs since they are variable based on product sales 
the company continues to invest approximately two percent of its revenue in research and development each year 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding research  design and development costs 
intellectual property steelcase s commitment to research and development has resulted in its being awarded more design and utility patents than any other manufacturer in its industry 
currently  steelcase holds approximately active us design and utility patents for current and anticipated products  and approximately patents in other countries 
the average remaining life of the utility patents in our united states portfolio is approximately years 
we occasionally enter into license agreements under which we pay a royalty to third parties for the use of patented products  designs or process technology 
we have also registered various trademarks and service marks in the united states and other countries 
collectively  we hold registrations for approximately united states and  foreign trademarks 
we have established a global network of intellectual property licenses with our affiliates 
we also selectively license our intellectual property to third parties as a revenue source 
for example  our leap seating technology has been licensed for use in automotive and aircraft seating  and we are pursuing other licensing opportunities for this technology 
we do not believe that any material part of our business is dependent on the continued availability of any one or all of our patents or trademarks  or that our business would be materially adversely affected by the loss of any  except the brayton  designtex  details  leap  metro  polyvision  steelcase  turnstone  vecta and werndl trademarks 

table of contents working capital our receivables are primarily from our dealers  and to a lesser degree  direct sell customers 
payment terms vary by country and region 
the terms of our north america and sdp segments  and certain markets within the international segment  encourage prompt payment by offering a discount 
other international markets have  by market convention  longer payment terms 
we are not aware of any special or unusual practices or conditions related to working capital items  including accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable  which are significant to understanding our business or the industry at large 
backlog our products are generally manufactured and shipped within four to six weeks following receipt of order  therefore  we do not view the amount of backlog at any particular time as a meaningful indicator of longer term shipments 
environmental matters we are subject to a variety of federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment environmental laws 
subject to the matter noted below  and under item  legal proceedings  we believe our operations are in substantial compliance with all environmental laws 
we do not believe that existing environmental laws and regulations have had or will have any material effects upon the capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position of the company 
in june  the united states environmental protection agency epa and michigan department of environmental quality mdeq conducted an inspection of the energy centers and other air emission sources at the steelcase facilities in kentwood and grand rapids  michigan 
following the inspection  the epa requested stack testing  which showed anomalous results for sulfur dioxide 
additional testing confirmed that a supplier providing coal not meeting steelcase s purchase specifications caused the anomalous results 
to avoid future occurrences  steelcase has changed the process for testing coal prior to its use by the company and will be adding continuous emissions monitoring equipment 
although the mdeq has concurred informally with our assessment of the cause of the anomalous results and our changes in coal testing and emissions monitoring  it is still possible that mdeq or epa could issue a notice of violation and seek penalties or other costs 
potential penalties or costs cannot be estimated at this time 
under certain environmental laws  steelcase could be held liable  without regard to fault  for the costs of remediation associated with our existing or historical operations 
we could also be held responsible for third party property and personal injury claims or for violations of environmental laws relating to contamination 
steelcase is a party to  or otherwise involved in  legal proceedings relating to several contaminated properties being investigated and remediated under environmental laws 
based on our information regarding the nature and volume of wastes allegedly disposed of or released at these properties  the number of other financially viable potentially responsible parties and the total estimated cleanup costs  we do not believe that the costs to us associated with these properties will be material  either individually or in the aggregate 
the company has established reserves we believe are adequate to cover our anticipated remediation costs 
however  certain events could cause actual costs or losses to vary from the established reserves 
these events include  but are not limited to a change in governmental regulations and or cleanup standards or requirements  undiscovered information regarding the nature and volume of wastes allegedly disposed of or released at these properties  and other factors increasing the cost of remediation or the loss of other potentially responsible parties that are financially capable of contributing towards cleanup costs

see note of our consolidated financial statements for further information on property 
item legal proceedings we are involved in litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 
based on known information  we do not believe we are a party to any lawsuit or proceeding that is likely to have a material adverse effect on the company 
in july  the california south coast air quality management district scaqmd issued a notice of violation in connection with the transfer of steelcase s california operations from tustin to city of industry coi 
as a part of the operations transfer  certain environmental emission permits were transferred from the tustin facility to coi with the intent that tustin be left with sufficient emission credits to conduct its wind up operations 
the tustin facility was obligated to submit quarterly reconciliations showing that the combined operations of tustin and coi met the overall permit limits 
although tustin facility personnel submitted the reconciliations showing that overall permit limits had been met  the final reconciliation was submitted several days late due to an administrative oversight 
because of the late submission  the scaqmd views the tustin emissions as exceeding applicable limits 
potential penalties  costs or assessments have not yet been sought and cannot be estimated at this time 
in addition to the energy center issues noted under environmental matters  an additional issue was identified during the stack testing at the grand rapids energy center  when the diameter of the exhaust stack was questioned 
the interior diameter of the stack was measured and found to be wider than the diameter specified in the permit 
on april   mdeq issued a letter of violation based on the non compliant stack diameter 
steelcase conducted emission modeling  which confirmed that the larger diameter does not effect emissions 
the mdeq has indicated that it will not seek any penalty or other costs under the notice of violation

table of contents restatement of financial statements the company has completed a review of its lease accounting policies and is correcting its method of accounting for certain leases by restating financial statements for and the restatement increased net loss by and in and  respectively  and reduced retained earnings by at february  from  to  the restatement had no impact on revenue or operating cash flows and  due to rounding  had no impact on earnings per share 
the company considers these restatement adjustments to be immaterial 
the company initiated its review of its lease accounting in response to a public letter published by the chief accountant of the sec on february  the correction involves recording expense for leases with escalating rents on a straight line basis over the lease term  rather than as payable 
the company s audit committee  meeting on march   concurred with management s recommendation that the company should restate the financial statements 
in addition  the company s investments in auction rate securities of have been reclassified in the company s consolidated balance sheet as short term investments for previously  these investments were classified as cash and cash equivalents 
this reclassification also resulted in changes to the company s and consolidated statements of cash flows 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the effects of these changes on our consolidated balance sheets as of february   as well as on our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for and overview steelcase returned to profitability in after experiencing a three year sales decline in the global office furniture industry  the industry has begun to show signs of sustained recovery in the past year

our revenue increased in compared to following a decline of from to as compared to  revenue benefited by from dealers consolidated in and from favorable currency translation effects in our international segment 
operating income improved in primarily due to lower restructuring charges  the benefits realized from lean initiatives and prior restructuring activities 
these improvements were partially offset by increases in commodity prices  increases in variable compensation expense  and disruptions from current year plant consolidations

interest expense increased in primarily due to in additional interest expense from the consolidation of debt from variable interest entities 
interest on our term notes has been stable since because the interest rates are fixed 
interest income increased in primarily due to higher cash and investment balances and higher interest rates 
in  we recorded a gain on dealer transitions which represented an equity return related to a previous international dealer transition and a recovery on dealer transition financing that was previously reserved 
losses on dealer transitions in prior years relate to uncollectible funds loaned to or invested in dealers to finance ownership changes 
the majority of the loss recorded in related to an international dealer transition investment originally made in we took over full ownership of this dealer during and reduced the carrying value of the investment to the net book value of the underlying tangible assets  which approximated its fair value 
during  we recognized losses on dealer transitions primarily related to two international dealers that were significantly affected by the office furniture recession in their markets 
losses on dealer transitions do not include write offs of receivables that have arisen as a result of product sales 
charges for write offs associated with trade receivables from these affiliates are recorded as operating expenses 
we carefully monitor the financial condition of dealers in ownership transition 
most of the dealers that have transition financing from steelcase have successfully reduced costs and taken other steps to manage through the downturn 
however  we have established reserves for certain dealers facing difficult financial challenges 
we believe our reserves adequately reflect the credit risk associated with these dealers 
if these dealers experience additional financial challenges  the likelihood of losses would increase and we would record additional charges or reserves  as necessary 
during  we recorded a gain on disposal of property and equipment primarily related to property sold in the united kingdom for net cash proceeds of and a pre tax non operating gain of this facility was idle for about three years as a result of prior restructuring activities 
the gain 
table of contents in was primarily related to the sale of our tustin  california manufacturing facility following the relocation of the operations to a smaller  more efficient facility 
we received net cash proceeds of and recorded a gain of on the tustin facility sale 
miscellaneous  net includes items such as gains and losses on foreign exchange and gains and losses on the sale of venture investments 
in  we recorded an reduction in a specific tax reserve 
the tax reserve was originally recorded in response to a fiscal tax calculation that was later rejected by the irs 
at the time of the rejection  we recorded a reserve for the total amount of the deduction while we challenged the irs s decision 
during q  the tax court ruled favorably on a similar case related to another company 
because we believed this precedent supported our position  we reduced the original reserve by during q  the irs agreed to settle the claim and the tax reserve was adjusted by an additional we calculated our tax expense for using a rate and then adjusted it for the favorable reserve reduction 
we expect our long term effective tax rate to remain between and

these costs included in severance costs for workforce reductions and for asset impairments partially offset by a curtailment gain of for post retirement medical benefits 
restructuring items included within and cost of sales primarily consisted of severance costs for workforce reductions and asset impairment charges 
in  we expect to continue to reduce excess capacity resulting from the implementation of lean manufacturing principles and other operational improvements 
we announced additional restructuring activities in march the estimated net pre tax restructuring charges of to over the next two years related to these activities consist of net costs of employee terminations  the impairment of certain fixed assets and the cost of relocating production lines 
as part of these consolidation efforts  we expect to reduce excess manufacturing space by approximately million square feet over the next two years 
once this two year project is complete  we expect annual pretax savings of approximately to the improvement in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in compared to was primarily a result of continued cost control and higher volume 
the improvement was partially offset by an increase in variable compensation expense of and from the dealers newly consolidated in restructuring charges that are separate components of operating expenses in   and represented severance costs for workforce reductions  net of curtailment gains 
we maintain loss reserves related to dealer trade receivables  and we closely monitor the financial condition of our dealers 
we have processes that allow us to monitor and react quickly to changes in the credit quality of our dealers 
we believe our reserves adequately reflect the credit risks associated with the dealer trade receivables 
however  if our dealers are not able to reduce costs and take other necessary steps during an industry downturn  the likelihood of losses would increase and additional charges or reserves would be necessary

international revenue is closely linked to economic conditions in france  germany  spain and the united kingdom and to a lesser extent  other western european countries 
the international segment saw shipment declines in many of these markets in the current year 
fourth quarter revenues and order patterns seem to suggest that the economic environment is stabilizing in these markets as we enter eastern and central european  latin american and asia pacific export markets posted modest growth in compared to varied results in gross margins as a percent of revenue improved to in from in primarily due to lower restructuring costs and benefits from prior restructuring activities

operating expenses in absolute terms increased in  primarily due to of currency translation effects and related to dealer consolidations 
restructuring costs related to operating expenses in  and primarily consisted of charges related to workforce reductions and business exit costs 
economic conditions in certain countries continue to put profitability pressure on some of our dealers 
we continue to monitor the financial condition of dealers for changes in credit quality but we believe our reserves adequately reflect these credit risks 
however  if dealers experience a deeper reduction in revenues  the likelihood of losses would increase and additional charges or reserves would be necessary 

table of contents other year ended february  february  february  income statement data other as restated as restated revenue restructuring costs operating loss our other category includes our polyvision  ideo  and financial services subsidiaries  and unallocated corporate expenses 
the reduction in operating loss in was due to several factors including improvements in the operating results of financial services primarily due to lower credit charges in and lower administrative expenses  and improvements in the operating results of ideo and polyvision 
approximately of corporate expenses representing shared services are charged to the operating segments as part of a corporate allocation 
the unallocated portion of these expenses is considered general corporate costs and is reported within the other category 
revenue and costs of exploring new business opportunities within new market niches or areas related to  but not part of  our core business activities are considered ventures  and are reported in the other category 
restructuring costs included in operating results included a polyvision lease impairment and workforce reductions 
restructuring costs in and primarily related to workforce reductions 
over the past two years  our financial services subsidiary has implemented a new strategy in which we originate leases for customers and earn an origination fee on that service 
we use a third party to provide lease funding 
as a result  we no longer have credit or residual risk related to those leases 
additionally  we sold a substantial portion of our old leasing portfolio during and as a result  our overall credit exposure to our underlying net investment in these older leases has decreased 
we have processes that allow us to monitor and react quickly to changes in the credit quality of our lease customers 
the overall credit quality of our portfolio improved during and our risk of exposure decreased as customers became more financially stable and as balances declined with normal lease payments 
we reduced some previously established credit reserves by in due to the improved performance on specific leases 
we closely monitor our receivable exposure and the overall financial condition of the dealers in north america to whom we extend working capital financing 
although we believe reserves are adequate in total  deterioration in the financial stability of larger customers and dealers would likely require us to record additional charges and reserves 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity the following table summarizes our statement of cash flows year ended february  february  february  as restated as restated net cash flow provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents  beginning of period cash and cash equivalents  end of period during  we increased cash and cash equivalents by to a balance of as of february   our highest level of cash since these funds and our short term investments  in addition to cash generated from future operations and available credit facilities  are expected to be sufficient to finance our known or foreseeable liquidity and capital needs 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents was due to a number of factors 
operating activities generated cash from net income plus depreciation and amortization which is added back to net income 
depreciation and amortization continue to be much higher than current levels of capital expenditures 
financing activities used cash to pay down debt and to pay dividends 
cash and cash equivalents include invested in a money market fund  the use of which is restricted as collateral primarily for our accrued liability related to our workers compensation program 
if this restricted cash is needed for liquidity purposes  we can replace the collateral for our workers compensation program with a letter of credit and have full access to the proceeds of the money market fund 
during  we reclassified our investments in auction rate securities from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments 
auction rate securities classified as short term investments were and as of february  and february   respectively 
these investments are typically held for approximately days  and all investments held at year end were converted to cash by march  because auction rate securities are no longer classified as cash  acquisitions of investments in these securities are a use of cash from investing activities and liquidations of these securities are a source of cash from investing activities 
notes and to the consolidated financial statements provide more information regarding this reclassification 
we look at various scenarios for cash planning purposes 
in one possible scenario a substantial and rapid increase in revenue in a short period of time we anticipate we would likely experience a corresponding rapid increase in accounts receivables and inventories 
this rapid increase in required working capital would represent a significant use of cash 
we retain sufficient cash balances to respond to working capital needs driven by a rapid increase in revenue 
significant uses of cash in q include approximately in debt repayments and an annual payment of related to variable compensation

the year to year change in cash generated from operating activities was primarily due to improvements in year over year income from continuing operations 
additionally  other  net  decreased primarily due to current year restructuring payments  lower charges related to dealer transitions and fixed asset impairments and disposals 
most of the change in cash generated from operating activities from to was due to a reduction in net loss  a gain on sale of net assets of discontinued operations in  a cumulative effect of accounting change in  and changes in operating assets and liabilities

in  capital expenditures were less than half of depreciation  which represented a source of cash 

table of contents in and  we generated cash from investing activities primarily from the sale of leased and fixed assets and the sale of our attwood facility in the sale of leased assets was primarily due to the new lease funding strategy implemented by our financial services subsidiary in in preparation for its new strategy  financial services sold a large portion of its lease portfolio in and continued to sell a portion of the remaining leased assets during and under its new strategy  financial services continues to originate leases for customers  but uses a third party to provide lease funding 
a significant amount of the cash generated from these activities was used to increase our short term investment portfolio 
proceeds from the disposal of fixed assets in and were primarily from the sale of domestic and international manufacturing facilities and related equipment 
we have significantly reduced our capital expenditures in the past three years to limit new projects to those that meet key economic metrics and deliver short payback cost savings or support critical strategic initiatives such as product development

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes 
although these estimates are based on historical data and management s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future  actual results may differ from the estimates if different conditions occur 
the accounting policies that typically involve a higher degree of judgment  estimates and complexity are listed and explained below 
these policies were discussed with the audit committee and affect all segments of the company 
impairment of goodwill  other intangible assets and long lived assets goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the related underlying tangible and identifiable intangible net asset values resulting from business acquisitions 
annually  or if conditions indicate an earlier review is necessary  the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared to an estimate of its fair value 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  goodwill is impaired and will be written down to its estimated fair value 
goodwill is assigned to and the fair value is tested at the reporting unit level 

table of contents we evaluate goodwill using five reporting units north america  sdp  international  polyvision and ideo 
as of february   we had of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet as follows recorded reporting unit goodwill north america steelcase design partnership international polyvision ideo total during q  we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill in our reporting units consistent with the prior year 
in testing for potential impairment  we measured the estimated fair value of our reporting units using a combination of two methods based upon a discounted cash flow valuation dcf and a market value approach mva 
the first method used a weighting factor based on dcf while the second valuation was based upon of dcf and of mva 
in either case  we concluded no impairment existed in any reporting unit 
the dcf analysis was based on the present value of projected cash flows and a residual value and used the following assumptions a business is worth today what it can generate in future cash to its owners  cash received today is worth more than an equal amount of cash received in the future  and future cash flows can be reasonably estimated 
the mva used a set of four comparable companies to derive a range of market multiples for the last twelve months revenue and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the mva was not calculated for polyvision or ideo as there is no comparable market data available to make these calculations meaningful 
as of the valuation date  the enterprise value available for goodwill determined by each method described above is in excess of the underlying reported value of the goodwill as follows enterprise value in excess of reported goodwill using an discount rate discounted market cash flow value north america steelcase design partnership international polyvision n a ideo n a 
table of contents for each reporting unit  this excess is primarily driven by the residual value of future years 
thus  increasing the discount rate from to  leaving all other assumptions unchanged  would reduce the excess amounts above to the following amounts enterprise value in excess of reported goodwill using a discount rate discounted market cash flow value north america steelcase design partnership international polyvision n a ideo n a we also perform impairment analyses on our other intangible assets not subject to amortization using an income approach based on the cash flows attributable to the related products 
these intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks within the polyvision reporting unit 
as of the valuation date  the fair value exceeded the book value by approximately a decrease in projected revenue would result in a reduction of the excess fair value by a increase in the discount rate would result in a reduction of the excess fair value by for our intangible assets subject to amortization and our other long lived assets including property  plant and equipment  an impairment analysis is performed at least annually 
in accordance with sfas no 
 an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
in testing for impairment  we first determined if the asset was recoverable 
we then compared the undiscounted cash flows over the asset s remaining life to the carrying value 
see note  note and note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding goodwill  other intangible assets and property  plant and equipment 
pension and other post retirement benefits the determination of the obligation and expense for pension and other post retirement benefits is dependent on the selection of certain actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and health care costs 
these assumptions are reviewed and updated annually based on relevant external and internal factors and information  including but not limited to  long term expected fund returns  expenses paid from the fund  rates of termination  medical inflation  technology and quality care changes  regulatory requirements  plan changes and governmental coverage changes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding employee benefit plan obligations including a sensitivity analysis 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses related to accounts receivable  investments in leases and notes receivable is maintained at a level considered by management to be adequate to absorb an estimate of probable future losses existing at the balance sheet date 
in estimating probable losses  we review accounts that are past due  non performing  or in bankruptcy 
we also review accounts that may have higher credit risk using information available about the customer or dealer  such as financial statements  news reports  and published credit ratings 
we also use general information regarding industry trends  the general economic environment and information gathered through our network of field based employees 
using an estimate of current fair market value of the collateral and other credit enhancements  such as third party guarantees  we arrive at an estimated loss for specific accounts and estimate an additional amount for the remainder of the trade balance based on historical trends 

table of contents our projection of credit losses is based on estimates  and as a result we cannot predict with certainty the amount of such losses 
changes in economic conditions  the risk characteristics and composition of the portfolio  bankruptcy laws or regulatory policies and other factors could impact our actual and projected credit losses and the related allowance for possible credit losses 
if we had made different assumptions about probable credit losses  our financial position and results of operations could have differed 
uncollectible receivable balances are written off when we determine that the balance is uncollectible 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance when received 
see further discussion regarding concentrations of credit risk in note of the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
these assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
the company has operating loss carryforwards of and tax credit carryforwards of available in certain jurisdictions to reduce future taxable income 
future tax benefits for these carryforwards are recognized to the extent that realization of these benefits is considered more likely than not 
we estimate a tax savings from the operating loss carryforwards before valuation allowance of  but we have recorded a valuation allowance of which reduces our estimated tax savings to additionally  we have recorded a valuation allowance of against our tax credit carryforwards which reduces our estimated tax savings to it is considered more likely than not that a benefit of will be realized on these carryforwards 
this determination is based on the expectation that related operations will be sufficiently profitable or various tax  business and other planning strategies will enable us to utilize the carryforwards 
to the extent that available evidence raises doubt about the realization of a deferred income tax asset  a valuation allowance is established 
we cannot be assured that we will be able to realize these future tax benefits or that future valuation allowances will not be required 
a decrease in the expected amount of benefit to be realized on the carryforwards would result in a decrease in net income of approximately forward looking statements from time to time  in written reports and oral statements  the company discusses its expectations regarding future events

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed include foreign exchange risk  interest rate risk and equity price risk 
foreign exchange risk operating in international markets involves exposure to the possibility of volatile movements in foreign exchange rates 
these exposures may impact future earnings and or cash flows 
revenue from foreign locations primarily europe and canada represented approximately and of our consolidated revenue in and  respectively 
we actively manage the foreign currency exposures that are associated with committed foreign currency purchases and sales created in the normal course of business at the local entity level 
exposures that cannot be naturally offset within a local entity to an immaterial amount are hedged with foreign currency derivatives 
we also have a significant amount of foreign currency net asset exposures 
in february and march  we entered into a series of forward contracts to hedge our net investment in canada to reduce the risk of exposure to changes in exchange rates 
the notional amount of these contracts was million canadian dollars in february and million canadian dollars in march changes in foreign exchange rates that had the largest impact on translating our international operating profit for related to the euro and the canadian dollar versus the us dollar 
we estimate that a devaluation of the us dollar against the local currencies would have increased our operating income by approximately in and increased our loss in by approximately  assuming no changes other than the exchange rate itself 
however  this quantitative measure has inherent limitations 
the sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency 
the translation of the assets and liabilities of our international subsidiaries is made using the foreign exchange rates as of the end of the year 
translation adjustments are not included in determining net income but are disclosed and accumulated in other comprehensive income within shareholders equity until sale or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the international subsidiary takes place 
in certain markets  the company could recognize a significant gain or loss related to unrealized cumulative translation adjustments if we were to exit the market and 
table of contents liquidate our net investment 
as of february   the net foreign currency translation adjustments reduced shareholders equity by foreign exchange gains and losses reflect transaction gains and losses 
transaction gains and losses arise from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a business unit s functional currency 
for  transaction gains and losses were immaterial 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily on our notes receivable  investments in company owned life insurance  short term borrowings and long term debt 
substantially all of our interest rates on our term borrowings were fixed during  thus our interest rate risk was minimized 
a portion of our company owned life insurance is invested in fixed income securities 
the valuation of these securities is sensitive to changes in market interest rates 
we estimate that a change in interest rates would not have had a material impact on our results of operations for or see notes and of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of interest rate swaps and derivative instruments 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in company owned life insurance 
equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risk from the markets in the united states primarily on our investments in company owned life insurance 
we estimate that a adverse change in the broader united states equity markets would have reduced our operating income by approximately in and increased our operating loss by approximately in this quantitative measure has inherent limitations since not all of our equity investments are in similar asset classes 
in addition  the investment managers actively manage certain equity investments and their results could be better or worse than the broader united states equity markets returns 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in company owned life insurance
