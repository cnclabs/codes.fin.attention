item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled risks related to our business and elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
accordingly  we have had to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported on our consolidated financial statements 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments about future events and their effects on our results cannot be determined with certainty  and are made based upon our historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained  and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our consolidated financial statements and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
different estimates that we could have used  or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur  may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we also refer you to our the company and summary of significant accounting policies discussed in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
revenue recognition we manufacture and sell high performance compound semiconductor substrates and sell certain raw materials including gallium  germanium dioxide  and pbn crucibles 
after we ship our products  there are no remaining obligations or customer acceptance requirements that would preclude revenue recognition 
our products are typically sold pursuant to a purchase order placed by our customers  and our terms and conditions of sale do not require customer acceptance 
we recognize revenue upon shipment and transfer of title of products to our customers  which is either upon shipment from our dock  receipt at the customer s dock  or removal from consignment inventory at the customer s location  provided that we have received a signed purchase order  the price is fixed or determinable  title and risk of ownership have transferred  collection of resulting receivables is probable  and product returns are reasonably estimable 
we do not provide training  installation or commissioning services 
additionally  we do not provide discounts or other incentives to customers except for one customer with whom we agreed in the fourth quarter of to provide a certain amount of cumulative discounts on future product purchases from us 
we will recognize these discounts in future periods as a reduction in revenue as products are sold to this customer 
we provide for future returns based on historical experience  current economic trends and changes in customer demand at the time revenue is recognized 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a reserve for sales returns of  related to our failure to follow certain testing requirements and provision of testing data and information to certain customers 
this reserve was based on discussions with some of the affected customers and review of specific shipments 
approximately  of the  sales returns reserve had been utilized as of december  see further discussion in results of operations below 
allowance for doubtful accounts we periodically review the likelihood of collection on our accounts receivable balances and provide an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable primarily based upon the age of these accounts 
we provide a allowance for us receivables in excess of days and for foreign receivables in excess of days 
we assess the probability of collection based on a number of factors  including the length of time a receivable balance has been outstanding  our past history with the customer and their credit worthiness 
in previous years  three of our customers had filed for bankruptcy protection 
upon notification of the bankruptcy  we immediately stopped shipping orders to these customers other than on payment in advance 
at that time  the outstanding balances of these customers had been fully reserved 
the related accounts receivable balances and reserve were subsequently written off in november when we finally determined that the balances were uncollectible 
this determination was made as a result of our unsuccessful efforts to collect these accounts receivable  the significant length of time that the receivables balance was outstanding  and the unlikelihood that we would collect the balances from the bankrupt s estate 
as of december  and  our accounts receivable balance was million and million  respectively  which was net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million  respectively 
during  we wrote off million of fully reserved accounts receivable and increased the allowance for doubtful accounts by million 
if actual uncollectible accounts differ substantially from our estimates  revisions to the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts would be required  which could have a material impact on our financial results for the period 
warranty reserve we maintain a warranty reserve based upon our claims experience during the prior twelve months 
warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized 
as of december   accrued product warranties totaled  if actual warranty costs differ substantially from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required  which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the weighted average cost method 
our inventory consists of raw materials as well as finished goods and work in process that include material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
given the nature of our substrate products  and the materials used in the manufacturing process  the wafers and ingots comprising work in process may be held in inventory for up to two years and three years  respectively  as the risk of obsolescence for these materials is low 
we routinely evaluate the levels of our inventory in light of current market conditions in order to identify excess and obsolete inventory and provide a valuation allowance for certain inventories based upon the age and quality of the product and the projections for sale of the completed products 
during the third quarter of  it became apparent that our revenues were likely to continue to decline in the fourth and subsequent quarters due to the need to re qualify our products with several customers 
furthermore  many new orders were for products with specifications that differed from the features of the products held in inventory 
in accordance with our policy  we evaluated the levels of our inventory  and determined that in light of current market conditions  we had excess and obsolete inventory based upon its age and quality  and that the inventory exceeded the sales projections as revised 
accordingly  we established a reserve for the excess 
as of december  and  we had an inventory reserve of million and million  respectively 
the majority of this inventory has not been scrapped 
if actual demand for our products were to be substantially lower than estimated  additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory might be required  which could have a material impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
impairment of investments we classify our investments in debt and equity securities as available for sale securities as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
all available for sale securities with a quoted market value below cost or adjusted cost are reviewed in order to determine whether the decline is other than temporary 
factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the magnitude of the decline in market value  the length of time the market value has been below cost or adjusted cost  credit quality  and our ability and intent to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
we invest in equity instruments of privately held companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are classified as other assets and are accounted for under the cost method as we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over their operations 
we monitor our investments for impairment and record reductions in carrying value when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
determination of impairment is highly subjective and is based on a number of factors  including an assessment of the strength of investee s management  the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  fundamental changes to the business prospects of the investee  share prices of subsequent offerings  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in our carrying value 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of property  equipment  and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when events and circumstances indicate that long lived assets may be impaired  we compare the carrying value of the long lived assets to the projection of future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets 
in the event that the carrying value exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows  we record an impairment charge against income equal to the excess of the carrying value over the asset s fair value 
employee stock options we believe that employee stock options represent an appropriate and essential component of our overall compensation program 
we grant options to substantially all management employees and believe that this broad based program helps us to attract  motivate  and retain high quality employees  to the ultimate benefit of our stockholders 
we currently account for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method under apb opinion no 
and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r is expected to result in a material increase in expense during the second half of based on unvested options outstanding as of december  and current compensation plans 
while the effect of adoption depends on the level of share based payments granted in the future and unvested grants on the date we adopt sfas r  the effect of this accounting standard on our prior operating results would approximate the effect of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss and net loss per share 
see note the company and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we provide for income taxes based upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region  particularly china 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws  particularly in foreign countries such as china 
results of operations overview we were founded in to commercialize and enhance our proprietary vertical gradient freeze vgf technique for producing high performance compound semiconductor substrates 
as a result of the discontinuance of our opto electronics division  and the sale of substantially all of the assets of this business in  we now have one operating segment our substrate business 
we recorded our first substrate sales in and our substrate division currently sells gallium arsenide gaas and indium phosphide inp substrates to manufacturers of semiconductor devices for use in applications such as fiber optic and wireless telecommunications  light emitting diodes leds and lasers 
we also sell raw materials including gallium and germanium through our participation in majority and minority owned joint ventures 
we had the capability to manufacture germanium substrates for use in satellite solar cells but withdrew from this business during so that we could more profitably use our then constrained capacity 
we are now trying to re qualify our germanium substrates with the few existing satellite solar cell system manufacturers 
continuing operations our continuing business  primarily sales of our substrate products  is dependant on the semiconductor industry  which is highly cyclical and has historically experienced downturns both as a result of economic changes and overcapacity 
during the first half of our revenues grew due to improvements in the wireless market 
in the second half of our revenue fell  however  because the substrate industry was still facing excess capacity that caused prices to decline  and because we experienced a loss of market share after two competitors developed technologies similar to ours 
in addition  certain customers selected competitors products in order to diversify their supply sources and due to the belief that the competitors substrates offered better surface qualities 
full year revenue declined million  or compared with we recorded losses in each quarter of and incurred impairment charges against fixed assets and inventory due to the decline in demand and prices 
in reaction to the economic downturn and competition  we initiated an aggressive effort to reduce substrate manufacturing costs 
this included moving much of our substrate manufacturing operations to china  reducing capacity in our fremont  california facility and developing and investing in key low cost raw material sources 
in  we believe that the wireless communications and hbled markets grew  but our revenue did not increase until the fourth quarter of due to continued reductions in prices  and time required to improve our substrate surface quality and regain some lost customers 
revenue for fell by million  or compared with we recorded net losses in each quarter of during  we continued to shift more of our manufacturing operations to china and reduced our costs incurred in the united states 
in  our revenue increased million as compared to  primarily as a result of increased demand for hbleds 
in march  we learned of certain failures to comply with requirements for product testing and the provision of testing data and information relating to requirements of certain customers 
specifically  we determined that in some cases we had not provided accurate data to customers confirming that products shipped were compliant with all specifications provided by the customer  or had been manufactured at the location specified by the customer 
as a result of our conclusions  we reorganized our production and quality control procedures  established quality control and assurance as a direct reporting group to the chief executive officer  and implemented measures  including additional employee training  statistical sampling of product shipments during the quarter  and review of our satisfaction of customer specifications each quarter  to ensure adherence to operational controls 
we also implemented certain executive management changes 
as a result of the weaknesses identified  in the first quarter of we increased our sales return reserve by  based on our best estimate of future returns related to this matter 
approximately  of the  sales returns reserve had been utilized as of december  this reserve was based  in part  on discussion with affected customers 
the amount of the reserve was determined in part based upon the amount of our historical product returns  payment history of prior period receivables  discussions with customers concerning the non compliant product and testing data  and estimated levels of our product maintained by customers  and likelihood that products previously shipped would be returned to us 
during the second quarter of  we announced plans to cease all production activities in the united states and to manufacture our products only in china 
see further discussion under impairment and restructuring charges below 
discontinued opto electronics business in june  we announced the discontinuation of our opto electronics division  which we had established as part of our acquisition of lyte optronics  inc in may the discontinued opto electronics division manufactured blue  cyan  and green high brightness light emitting diodes hbleds for the illumination markets  including full color displays  wireless handset backlighting and traffic signals  and also manufactured vertical cavity surface emitting lasers vcsels and laser diodes for fiber optic communications and storage area networks 
accordingly  the results of operations of the opto electronics division have been segregated from continuing operations and are reported separately as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for details regarding the accounting for discontinued operations 
in september  we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of our opto electronics business to lumei optoelectronics corp 
lumei and dalian luming science and technology group  co  ltd 
for the chinese renminbi rmb equivalent of million 
a portion of the purchase price equal to million was held in escrow to satisfy any claims that the purchaser might make for breaches of representations or warranties by us 
of this total escrow  could be released after the one year anniversary of the sale of the opto electronics business and the remainder could be released after the second anniversary of the sale 
given the difficult negotiations we encountered with the acquiring company when negotiating the sale of the opto electronics business  as well as the historical operating problems of the business  we determined there was significant uncertainty regarding the recoverability of the escrowed amounts 
accordingly  we did not recognize the cash held in escrow in recording the sale of the opto electronics division 
we will only record amounts as and when they are received 
to date  we have resolved all claims made against the first  held in escrow by the acquiring company  and expect to receive all but  of the first  held in escrow 
as of december   approximately  was released from escrow and accordingly we recorded a gain on discontinued operations in in february  we received an additional  from escrow  leaving  in escrow  which will not be eligible for release until september in addition  we retain a building located in monterey park  california that we have listed on the market for sale 
this asset has been classified as held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and we recorded in the fourth quarter a million market value adjustment after we accepted an offer in january from a real estate developer to purchase the property for net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting estimated commission and selling expenses 
we expect the sale to be completed in the second quarter of impairment and restructuring charges inventory impairment prior to  our markets had steadily increased  causing us to build inventory to meet demand 
in the second half of  we experienced a decrease in revenue as a result of a rapid decline in the mobile and fiber optic telecommunications markets 
we experienced lower revenues and slower bookings than forecast  as well as postponements and cancellations of orders 
the market decline continued into  as significant excess capacity developed in the substrate industry  sales prices declined  and our revenues fell  resulting in a higher ratio of inventory levels to revenue 
in addition  two competitors had developed and were successfully selling products with technologies similar to ours  capturing a significant portion of our market share 
with this unexpected loss in market share  we determined that it would be harder to recover even once the market improved 
as our revenue continued to decline  and the industry continued to experience excess capacity  it became apparent by the fourth quarter of that the amount of inventory we would be able to utilize was significantly less than previously projected and that the amount of inventory on hand exceeded the then current sales projections for those products 
as a result  we wrote down million of obsolete inventory in  none of which has been subsequently sold 
of this amount  inventory valued at million and million were scrapped in the second and fourth quarter of  respectively 
in september  we wrote down an additional million of obsolete inventory 
the wafers and ingots comprising the written down inventory had been manufactured within the prior two and three years  respectively 
during the third quarter of  it became apparent that our revenues were likely to continue to decline in the fourth and subsequent quarters due to the need to re qualify our products with several customers 
furthermore  many new orders were for products with specifications that differed from the features of the products held in inventory 
in accordance with our policy  we evaluated the levels of our inventory  and determined that in light of current market conditions  we had excess and obsolete inventory based upon its age and quality  and that the inventory exceeded the sales projections as revised 
accordingly  we established a reserve for the excess 
the majority of this inventory has not been scrapped 
reduction in long lived assets also as a result of this decline and the adverse impact on our revenues  during the second quarter of we revised our financial forecast and initiated an aggressive effort to reduce our substrate manufacturing costs 
this included moving more of our substrate manufacturing to china beginning in the second quarter of  and ultimately shutting down our fremont  california facility 
given the lowered sales projections and the expectation to close down our fremont manufacturing facility  we undertook a review of the long lived assets of our substrate business in order to determine whether the expected undiscounted  future cash flows were sufficient to recover the carrying values of the related assets 
this review undertaken in the second quarter of indicated that an impairment charge of million was required to write down these long lived assets to their estimated fair market value 
in order to determine the fair value of these assets  we calculated the present value of expected cash flows of the substrate operations 
the estimated cash flows were based on our updated revenue outlook  and accordingly we revised our operating budget and related cash flows discounted at the rate reflecting our average cost of capital 
opto electronics business during the third quarter of  we recorded an additional impairment charge of million related to our opto electronics division 
the primary business of this division was the manufacture of light emitting diodes led s 
our business in this division was heavily dependent on one customer 
in the third quarter of  we experienced a significant quality problem which ultimately resulted in this customer canceling all current and future orders 
given the uncertainty of resolving the quality issue and the significance of this customer to the operations  we undertook an impairment review in the third quarter which indicated that the undiscounted cash flows were not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the related long lived assets 
accordingly  an impairment charge was recorded to write down the assets to their estimated fair market value 
the estimated fair market value was based on management s estimate of the fair value  with management making this determination based in part on an independent valuation of the assets 
as a result of our decision to discontinue the opto electronics business in  the million charge related to the opto electronics business was reclassified into loss from discontinued operations in restructuring charges during the second quarter of  we announced plans to cease all production activities in the united states and to manufacture our products only in china 
in june  we incurred a restructuring charge of million as a result of our decision to close down our remaining manufacturing facilities in the united states 
in the third and fourth quarter of  we incurred additional restructuring charges of  for a total of million in these charges comprised costs related to the reduction in work force effected in june  and lease costs associated with the facilities located in california that are no longer required to support production 
in aggregate  we eliminated positions  of which were production workers 
as of december   we saved approximately  in payroll and related expenses 
on an annual basis  we anticipate payroll and related expense savings of million 
in  we will continue to reduce costs by qualifying new lower cost suppliers  moving more of our administrative functions to china where our costs are lower  and streamlining our organization structure and costs in the united states and china to bring them in line with with our current business 
refer to note to our consolidated financial statements 
other impairment also in the third quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of  to write down the value of our investment in a private company 
we made the decision to write down the investment as a result of the declining financial position of the investee  evidenced by an audit opinion with a going concern explanatory paragraph received by the investee 
the  was the remaining balance of this investment

the decrease in gaas and inp substrate revenue was due to the pricing pressures causing prices to decline and overall lesser demand from our telecommunications and wireless application customers 
raw material sales increased million  or  to million in compared to million in the increase in raw material sales was due to customers higher demand  particularly for raw gallium and germanium dioxide 
revenue from continuing operations decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in total gaas substrate revenue decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in sales of inch and inch diameter gaas substrates  which were used exclusively to manufacture electronic devices  decreased million  or to million in compared to million in inp substrate revenue decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in inp substrates were used almost exclusively for telecommunications applications 
the decrease in gaas and inp substrate revenue was due to decreased volume and lower average sales prices as a result of the slowdown in our target markets including telecommunications  high speed electronic devices  and short wavelength lasers  and the introduction of vgf like substrates from our competitors that caused some customers to purchase substrates from our competitors rather than from us

sales to customers outside of north america represented approximately  and of our revenue during  and  respectively 
international revenue continued to increase during as compared to primarily due to sales growth of million and million in europe and asia pacific including japan and taiwan  respectively 
the increase was the result of our continued penetration into the asian markets  particularly taiwan and china 
international revenue increased during as compared to primarily due to sales growth of million  million  and million in europe  japan  and taiwan  respectively 
the increase was driven by greater share of our gaas substrates being used in opto electronics applications and the majority of our customers requiring these applications were in asia 
gross margin years ended december  to to increase decrease change increase decrease change in thousands gross profit loss gross margin gross margin decreased to negative of revenue in compared to of revenue in the decrease was primarily due to the following factors during i a million charge for excess and obsolete inventory in the third quarter  ii an approximately million settlement charge with sumitomo electric industries  ltd 
in the third quarter  and iii the establishment of a sales return reserve of  in the first quarter related to our failure to follow certain testing requirements  which reduced revenues without affecting costs of revenues 
gross margin increased to of revenue in compared to negative in the increase was primarily due to reduced costs associated with moving most of our production to china 
in addition  we incurred a charge of million in related to the write down of certain inventory that we concluded was obsolete

american jobs creation act of repatriation of foreign earnings the american jobs creation act of the jobs act  enacted on october   allows us to repatriate earnings from our foreign subsidiaries at a reduced tax rate 
under the jobs act  we may elect  for one taxable year  an dividends received deduction for eligible dividends from our foreign subsidiaries 
the deduction would result in an approximate federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings 
to qualify for the deduction  the repatriated earnings must be reinvested in the united states pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan established by our chief executive officer and approved by the company s board of directors 
certain other criteria in the jobs act must be satisfied as well 
we may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in either fiscal or fiscal we are in the process of evaluating whether we will repatriate foreign earnings under the repatriation provisions of the jobs act 
we are not yet in a position to determine the impact of a qualifying repatriation  should we choose to make one  on our income tax expense for either fiscal or fiscal  the amount of our indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings  or the amount of our deferred tax liability with respect to foreign earnings 
liquidity and capital resources years ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes net change in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents beginning period cash and cash equivalents end of period short term investments end of period total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments we consider cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments as liquid and available for use 
short term investments are comprised of government bonds and high grade commercial debt instruments 
also included in short term investments is our investment in common stock of finisar corporation  a united states publicly traded company 
as of december   our principal sources of liquidity were million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  excluding restricted deposits 
cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  excluding million and million for our investment in finisar common stock as of december  and december   respectively  decreased million to million as of december  compared with million as of december  the combined decrease in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments was primarily due to payments of long term debt of million  purchase of machinery and equipment of million  and the continual funding of our operations 
the decrease in operating cash flow in  as compared with  was primarily the result of the absence during of certain non cash charges of million on the disposal of our discontinued opto electronics business and million on impairment of investments  a slower rate of decrease in inventories of million  partially offset by an improvement to our net loss of million 
net accounts receivable decreased by million  or  to million as of december  compared with million as of december  the decrease reflects lower fourth quarter sales compared with the same period in  better collections from customers and an establishment of a sales returns reserve of  recorded in the first quarter of net inventories decreased million  or to million as of december  compared with million as of december  we adopted a strategy of using inventory to conserve cash beginning in during  we had a million inventory valuation charge due to excess and obsolete inventory 
we do not expect to maintain the same rate of net inventory decrease in as we experienced in net cash used by investing activities of million for the year ended december  included purchases of property and equipment of million primarily used to transfer production capacity to china for the substrate division  and purchases of high grade investment securities with maturities of less than two years totaling million 
this was partially offset by sales of high grade investment securities totaling million and a decrease in our restricted deposits of million we do not have any plans to initiate any major new capital spending projects in we are currently completing certain projects at our china facilities 
we expect to invest approximately million in capital projects in we believe that our existing and planned facilities and equipment are sufficient to fulfill current and expected future orders 
net cash used in financing activities of million for the year ended december  consisted of payments of million related to long term borrowings  partially offset by proceeds of  as a result of purchases of our common stock by employees under our employee stock compensation programs 
in december  we reached a final settlement of our litigation with sumitomo electric industries  ltd 
sei  which includes a global intellectual property cross licensing agreement 
we recorded a charge of approximately million in the quarter ended september  in connection with this settlement 
under the terms of the settlement  we made a payment to sei in the amount of japanese yen one hundred and forty seven million  on january   and we will make on going royalty payments through on certain products sold by axt in japan 
subsequent to that payment  sei dropped the litigation in japan and we abandoned the interference proceedings in the us we believe that we have adequate cash and investments to meet our needs over the next months 
if our sales decrease  however  our ability to generate cash from operations will be adversely affected which could adversely affect our future liquidity  require us to use cash at a more rapid rate than expected  and require us to seek additional capital 
there can be no assurance that such additional capital will be available or  if available it will be at terms acceptable to us 
cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to those set forth below under risks related to our business 
off balance sheet arrangements we have never entered into any off balance sheet financing arrangements and have never established any special purpose entities 
we have not entered into any options on non financial assets 
we have entered into contracts to supply several large customers with gaas wafers 
the contracts guaranteed delivery of a certain number of wafers between january  and december  with a current contract value of  the contract sales prices are subject to review quarterly and can be adjusted in the event that raw material prices change 
in the event of non delivery of the determined wafer quantities in any monthly delivery period  we could be subject to non performance penalties of between and of the value of the delinquent monthly deliveries 
we have not received any claims for non performance penalties due to non delivery 
as of december   we have met all of its current delivery obligations under these contracts and expects to continue to meet delivery requirements during the remainder of the contract terms 
we indemnify certain customers for attorney fees and damages and costs awarded against these parties in certain circumstances if our products are found to infringe certain patents and they are sued by the patent holder and awarded damages 
there are limits on and exceptions to our potential liability for indemnification relating to intellectual patent infringement claims 
we cannot estimate the amount of potential future payments  if any  that we might be required to make as a result of these agreements 
to date  we have not paid any claim or been required to defend any action related to our indemnification obligations  and accordingly  we have not accrued any amounts for such indemnification obligations 
however  we may record charges in the future as a result of these indemnification obligations 
contractual obligations our main fremont  california manufacturing facility is financed by long term borrowings  which were refinanced by taxable variable rate revenue bonds in these bonds mature in and bear interest at a variable rate that was as of december  the bonds are traded in the public market 
repayment of principal and interest under the bonds is supported by a letter of credit from our bank and is paid on a quarterly basis 
we have the option to redeem the bonds in whole or in part during their term 
as of december   million was outstanding under these bonds 
as of december   the credit facility maintained by us with a bank included a letter of credit supporting repayment of our industrial bonds with an outstanding amount of approximately million 
we have pledged and placed certain investment securities with an affiliate of the bank as additional collateral for this facility 
we have also pledged certain investments for a credit facility for our workers compensation insurance policy for portions of accordingly  million of our cash and short term investments are restricted 
we lease certain office space  manufacturing facilities and property under long term operating leases expiring at various dates through march on march   we completed the sale of our property located at technology drive  fremont  california  for million 
net cash proceeds from the sale were million 
the gain incurred by us on this transaction was less than  under the terms of the sale agreement  we have agreed to lease back the property for a ten year period 
accordingly  on march   we signed an operating lease for this property through march total rent expenses under these operating leases were approximately million  million and million for years ended december   and  respectively 
we have a purchase obligation with a third party vendor to purchase million of equipment towards which we have paid a deposit of  leaving a net purchase obligation of million 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total we have made strategic investments in private companies located in china in order to gain access to raw materials at competitive costs that are critical to our substrate business 
we are currently negotiating a new joint venture investment in china for a germanium business opportunity  and upon the fulfillment of certain conditions  we may invest up to million in the new joint venture in risks related to our business we may incur claims or other liabilities or obligations related to our failure to follow requirements for testing of products and provision of testing data and information relating to customer requirements 
additionally  customers may cancel or reduce future shipments in response to these failures 
during the first quarter of we determined that we had not followed requirements for testing of products and provision of testing data and information relating to customer requirements 
we notified affected customers concerning our findings  however  there can be no assurance that we will not incur customer claims or other liabilities or obligations in connection with this matter  nor  if we receive any such claims  that we will not have to restate results from prior periods 
in addition  revenue in future periods may be adversely impacted if customers decide not to order from us as a result of this disclosure 
we experienced several cancellations of future orders by customers pending further information regarding enhancements to our product testing and quality control systems 
in addition  some customers are requiring additional qualification of our china operations before placing future orders with us 
we cannot be sure that we will not receive additional cancellations of orders by other customers  or fail to win expected future orders from customers  as a result of our disclosure of our investigation conclusions  or that our customers will qualify our china operations and place future orders with us 
because of power shortages in china  we may have to temporarily close our china operations  which would adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products  meet customer orders  and result in reduced revenues 
the chinese government faced a power crunch over the summer of and reported that power demand in provinces outstripped supply in peak periods during the first four months of instability in electrical supply caused sporadic outages among residential and commercial consumers 
as a result  the chinese government implemented tough measures in to ease the energy shortage which is expected to last at least through provinces imposed power brownouts during to reduce electricity demand and some companies in beijing were ordered to give their employees a week off to ease the pressure on power supply 
the plants  most of which are state owned  were closed and reopened on a staggered schedule to reduce power consumption during the capital s hottest months during as a result we closed most of our operations for a week in late july in conformance with this policy 
some shortages have already been reported in and the power shortages may be more severe than during if we are required to make additional temporary closures of our beijing and joint venture operations during  we may be unable to manufacture our products  and would then be unable to meet customer orders except from inventory on hand 
as a result  we could lose sales  adversely impacting our revenues  and our relationships with our customers could suffer  impacting our ability to generate future sales 
in addition  if power is shut off at our beijing operations at any time  either voluntarily or as a result of unplanned brownouts  during certain phases of our manufacturing process including our crystal growth phase  the work in process may be ruined and rendered unusable  causing us to incur expense that will not be covered by revenue  and negatively impacting our cost of goods sold and gross margins 
we are attempting to partially mitigate the potential effects of power outages by building inventory during early in anticipation of power outages during the summer 
this inventory build is prepared to accommodate forecast demand rather specific customer orders 
if the inventory we build is not ordered by customers  we may have to scrap these products and incur a cost which will reduce our gross margins 
our operating results depend in large part on further customer acceptance of our existing substrate products manufactured in china 
as we are now manufacturing only in china  if the shift of our substrate manufacturing operations to china is to be successful  we will need our customers to qualify products manufactured in china 
if we are unable to achieve qualifications for these products  our china facility will be underutilized  our investments in china will not be recouped and we will be unable to lower our costs by moving to china 
we may lose sales of our products to competitors who are not manufacturing in china  or whose operations in china have already been qualified by customers 
if customers do not fully qualify our china production  we may lose additional customers and fail to achieve revenue growth 
furthermore  some customers have reduced their orders from us until our surface quality is as good and consistent as that offered by competitors 
as a result  some customers are now allocating their requirements for compound semiconductor substrates across more competitors and we believe that we have lost revenue and market share as a result of these customer decisions  which we may be unable to recover 
if we are unable to retain our market share  our revenue and performance will decline 
problems incurred by our joint ventures or venture partners could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations we have invested in five joint venture operations in china that produce products including pure gallium n ga  high purity gallium  arsenic  germanium  germanium dioxide  paralytic boron nitride pbn crucibles  and boron oxide 
we purchase the materials produced by these ventures for our use and sell other portions of their production to third parties 
our ownership interest in these entities ranges from percent to percent 
we consolidate the three ventures in which we own a majority interest and employ equity accounting for the two joint ventures in which we have a percent interest 
several of these ventures occupy facilities within larger facilities owned and or operated by one of the other venture partners 
several of these venture partners are engaged in other manufacturing activities at or near the same facility 
in some facilities  we share access to certain functions  including water  treatment of hazardous waste or air quality treatment 
if any of our joint venture partners in any of these five ventures experience problems with their operations  disruptions of our joint venture operations could result  having a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operation of our joint ventures  and correspondingly on our financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  if any of our joint ventures or venture partners with whom our joint ventures share facilities are deemed to have violated applicable laws  rules or regulations governing the use  storage  discharge or disposal of hazardous chemicals during manufacturing  research and development  or sales demonstrations  the operations of our joint ventures could be adversely affected and we could be subject to substantial liability for clean up efforts  personal injury and fines or suspension or cessation of our joint venture operations as a result of the actions of the joint ventures or other venture partners 
employees working at the operations of our joint ventures or the operations of any of the other venture partners could bring litigation against us as a result of actions taken at the joint venture or venture partner facilities  even though we are not directly controlling the operations  including actions for exposure to chemicals or other hazardous materials at the facilities of our joint ventures or the facilities of any venture partner that are shared by our joint ventures 
if litigation is brought against us  litigation is inherently uncertain and while we would expect to defend ourselves vigorously  it is possible that our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be affected in any particular period by such litigation if brought against us  particularly if  as a non chinese company  litigation with us is deemed advantageous 
even if we are not deemed responsible for the actions of the joint ventures or venture partners  litigation could be costly  time consuming to defend and divert management attention  in addition  pursuit of us could occur if we are deemed to be the most financially viable of the partners 
going forward  we believe that investing in additional joint ventures will be important to remaining competitive in our marketplace and ensuring a supply of critical raw materials 
however  we may not be able to identify complementary joint venture opportunities or  even once opportunities are identified  we may not be able to reach agreement on the terms of the venture with the other venture partners 
additional joint ventures could cause us to incur contingent liabilities or other expenses  any of which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
since all of our joint venture activity is expected to occur in china  these activities could subject us to a number of risks associated with conducting operations internationally  including difficulties in managing geographically disparate operations  difficulties in enforcing agreements through non us legal systems  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements that may limit our ability to export the venture products or sell into particular jurisdictions or impose multiple conflicting tax laws and regulations  political and economic instability  civil unrest or war  terrorist activities that impact international commerce  difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights  particularly in countries where the laws and practices do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws and practices of the united states  changing laws and policies affecting economic liberalization  foreign investment  currency convertibility or exchange rates  taxation or employment  and nationalization of foreign owned assets  including intellectual property 
intellectual property infringement claims may be costly to resolve and could divert management attention 
other companies may hold or obtain patents on inventions or may otherwise claim proprietary rights to technology necessary to our business 
the markets in which we compete are comprised of competitors who in some cases hold substantial patent portfolios covering aspects of products that could be similar to ours 
we could become subject to claims that we are infringing patent  trademark  copyright or other proprietary rights of others 
for example  we have previously been involved in two separate lawsuits alleging patent infringement 
on june   cree  inc filed a complaint in the united states court for northern district of california against us alleging patent infringement 
the complaint sought damages and injunction against infringement 
on july   we filed a counter complaint in the united states court for northern district of california  denying any patent infringement and alleging that cree s actions were intentionally designed to interfere with our prospective business relationships 
we reached an agreement with cree resolving the disputes between us and signed a settlement agreement on march  the resolution of the disputes did not have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
on october   we announced that we had reached a tentative settlement of the litigation in japan and interference actions in the united states with sumitomo electric industries  ltd 
sei  which includes a global intellectual property cross licensing agreement 
axt and sei finalized this agreement on december  accordingly  we recorded a charge of approximately million for the quarter ended september in connection with this settlement  and are expected to make royalty payments on future sales of certain products 
the litigation was withdrawn in january  and we abandoned the interference proceeding 
if we fail to comply with environmental and safety regulations  we may be subject to significant fines or cessation of our operations  in addition  we could be subject to suits for personal injuries caused by hazardous materials 
we are subject to federal  state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations in all of our operating locations  including laws and regulations of china 
these laws  rules and regulations govern the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals during manufacturing  research and development  and sales demonstrations 
if we fail to comply with applicable regulations  we could be subject to substantial liability for clean up efforts  personal injury and fines or suspension or cessation of our operations 
in march  we settled a claim made by the california occupational safety and health administration  or cal osha  in an investigation primarily regarding impermissible levels of potentially hazardous materials in certain areas of our manufacturing facility in fremont  california for  and during we were the target of press allegations and correspondence purportedly on behalf of current and or former employees concerning our environmental compliance programs and exposure of our employees to hazardous materials  and there is a possibility that current and or former employees may bring litigation against us 
although we have put in place engineering  administrative and personnel protective equipment programs to address these issues  our ability to expand or continue to operate our present locations could be restricted or we could be required to acquire costly remediation equipment or incur other significant expenses 
existing or future changes in laws or regulations in the united states and china may require us to incur significant expenditures or liabilities  or may restrict our operations 
in addition  our employees could be exposed to chemicals or other hazardous materials at our facilities and we may be subject to lawsuits seeking damages for wrongful death or personal injuries allegedly caused by exposure to chemicals or hazardous materials at our facilities 
if litigation is brought against us  litigation is inherently uncertain and while we would expect to defend ourselves vigorously  it is possible that our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be affected in any particular period by such litigation if brought against us 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical and has experienced a downturn which has adversely impacted our operating results 
our continuing business depends in significant part upon manufacturers of electronic and opto electronic semiconductor devices  as well as the current and anticipated market demand for such devices and products using such devices 
as a supplier to the semiconductor industry  we are subject to the business cycles that characterize the industry 
the timing  length and volatility of these cycles are difficult to predict 
the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical because of sudden changes in demand for semiconductors  the manufacturing capacity of these semiconductors and changes in the technology employed in the semiconductors 
the rate of changes in demand  including end demand  is high  and the effect of these changes upon us occurs quickly  exacerbating the volatility of these cycles 
these changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers purchases and investments in new technology 
these industry cycles create pressure on our revenue  gross margin and net income loss 
the industry has in the past experienced periods of oversupply that result in significantly reduced demand and prices for semiconductor devices and components  including our products  both as a result of general economic changes and overcapacity 
when these periods occur  our operating results and financial condition are adversely affected  and create pressure on our revenue  gross margins and net income 
inventory buildups in telecommunications products and slower than expected sales of computer equipment resulted in overcapacity and led to reduced sales by our customers  and therefore reduced purchases of our products 
during periods of weak demand such as those experienced over the past years  customers typically reduce purchases  delay delivery of products and or cancel orders of component parts such as our products 
increased price competition has resulted  causing pressure on our net sales  gross margin and net income 
we experienced cancellations  price reductions  delays and push outs of orders  which have resulted in reduced revenues 
if the economic downturn occurred again  further order cancellations  reductions in order size or delays in orders could occur and would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
actions to reduce our costs  such as those we have recently taken  may be insufficient to align our structure with prevailing business conditions 
we may be required to undertake additional cost cutting measures  and may be unable to invest in marketing  research and development and engineering at the levels we believe are necessary to maintain our competitive position 
our failure to make these investments could seriously harm our business 
during periods of increasing demand for semiconductor devices  we must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand  and must be able to attract  hire  train and retain qualified employees to meet demand 
it appears that the semiconductor industry experienced increased demand during however  we cannot predict neither the sustainability nor rate of a recovery  if any 
if we are unable to effectively manage our resources and production capacity during an industry upturn  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our results of operations may suffer if we do not effectively manage our inventory 
we must manage our inventory of component parts  work in process  and finished goods effectively to meet changing customer requirements  while keeping inventory costs down and improving gross margins 
some of our products and supplies have in the past and may in the future become obsolete while in inventory due to changing customer specifications  or become excess inventory due to decreased demand for our products and an inability to sell the inventory within a foreseeable period 
furthermore  if current costs of production increase or sales prices drop below the standard prices at which we value inventory  we may need to take a charge for a reduction in inventory values 
we have in the past  including during  had to take inventory valuation and impairment charges 
if we are not able to manage successfully our inventory in the future  we may again need to write off un saleable  obsolete or excess inventory  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
during early we will increase work in process inventory in order to avoid the effects of probable power shortages in china 
we will prepare this inventory in accordance with our forecast of demand rather than against specific customer orders 
if we do not forecast correctly  customers may not order the inventory we manufacture  and we will incur a cost with no offsetting revenue 
ultimately  we would have to incur a charge for the value of unused inventory 
decreases in average selling prices of our products may reduce gross margins 
the market for compound semiconductor substrates is characterized by pressures on average selling prices resulting from factors such as increased competition or overcapacity 
we may experience price pressures on our products  and if average selling prices decline in the future  our revenues and gross margins could decline 
we may be unable to reduce the cost of our products sufficiently to counter the effect of lower selling prices and allow us to keep pace with competitive pricing pressures and our margins could be adversely affected 
the impact of changes in global economic conditions on our customers may cause us to fail to meet expectations  which would negatively impact the price of our stock 
our operating results can vary significantly based upon the impact of changes in global economic conditions on our customers 
more specifically  the macro economic environment that we faced since late was more uncertain than in some prior periods  the downturn which began in lasted longer than expected and materially and adversely affected us and our operating results 
the revenue growth and profitability of our business depends on the overall demand for our substrates  and we are particularly dependant on the market conditions for the wireless  solid state illumination  fiber optics and telecommunications industries 
because our sales are primarily to major corporate customers whose businesses fluctuate with general economic and business conditions  a softening of demand for products that use our substrates  caused by a weakening economy may result in decreased revenues 
customers may find themselves facing excess inventory from earlier purchases  and may defer or reconsider purchasing products due to the downturn in their business and in the general economy 
defects in our products could diminish demand for our products 
our products are complex and may contain defects 
we have experienced quality control problems with some of our products which caused customers to return products to us  reduce orders for our products  or both 
if we continue to experience quality control problems  or experience these or other problems in new products  customers may cancel or reduce orders or purchase products from our competitors and sales of our products could decline 
defects in our products could cause us to incur higher manufacturing costs and suffer product returns and additional service expenses  all of which could adversely impact our operating results 
if new products developed by us contain defects when released  our customers may be dissatisfied and we may suffer negative publicity or customer claims against us  lose sales or experience delays in market acceptance of our new products 
if we have low product yields  the shipment of our products may be delayed and our operating results may be adversely impacted 
our products are manufactured using complex technologies  and the number of usable substrates we can produce can fluctuate as a result of many factors  including impurities in the materials used  contamination of the manufacturing environment  substrate breakage  equipment failure  power outages or variations in the manufacturing process  and performance of personnel involved in the manufacturing process 
if our yields decrease  our revenue could decline if we are unable to produce needed product on time while our manufacturing costs remain fixed  or could increase 
we have experienced product shipment delays and difficulties in achieving acceptable yields on both new and older products  and delays and poor yields have adversely affected our operating results 
we may experience similar problems in the future and we cannot predict when they may occur or their severity 
in particular  many of our manufacturing processes are new and are still being refined  which can result in lower yields 
if we do not successfully develop new products to respond to rapidly changing customer requirements  our ability to generate revenue  obtain new customers  and retain existing customers may suffer 
our success depends on our ability to offer new products and product features that incorporate leading technology and respond to technological advances 
in addition  our new products must meet customer needs and compete effectively on quality  price and performance 
the life cycles of our products are difficult to predict because the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change  changing customer needs and evolving industry standards 
if our competitors introduce products employing new technologies or performance characteristics  our existing products could become obsolete and unmarketable 
during the past two years  we have seen our competitors selling more substrates manufactured using a crystal growth technology similar to ours  which has eroded our technological differentiation 
other companies  including triquent  are actively developing substrate materials that could be used to manufacture devices that could provide the same high performance  low power capabilities as gaas and inp based devices at competitive prices 
if these substrate materials or vgf derived products are successfully developed and semiconductor device manufacturers adopt them  demand for our gaas substrates could decline and our revenue could suffer 
the development of new products can be a highly complex process  and we may experience delays in developing and introducing new products 
any significant delays could cause us to fail to timely introduce and gain market acceptance of new products 
further  the costs involved in researching  developing and engineering new products could be greater than anticipated 
if we fail to offer new products or product enhancements or fail to achieve higher quality products  we may not generate sufficient revenue to offset our development costs and other expenses or meet our customers requirements 
intense competition in the markets for our products could prevent us from increasing revenue and sustaining profitability 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive 
we face competition for our substrate products from other manufacturers of substrates  such as freiberger  hitachi cable  japan energy and sumitomo electric and from semiconductor device manufacturers that produce substrates for their own use  and from companies  such as triquent  that are actively developing alternative materials to gaas and some semiconductor devices are being marketed using these materials 
we believe that at least two of our competitors are shipping high volumes of gaas substrates manufactured using a technique similar to our vgf technique 
other competitors may develop and begin using similar technology 
if we are unable to compete effectively  our revenue may not increase and we may be unable to be profitable 
we face many competitors that have a number of significant advantages over us  including greater experience in the business  more manufacturing experience  extensive intellectual property  broader name recognition  and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources 
our competitors could develop new or enhanced products that are more effective than our products are 
the level and intensity of competition has increased over the past year and we expect competition to continue to increase in the future 
competitive pressures caused by the current economic conditions have resulted in reductions in the prices of our products  and continued or increased competition could reduce our market share  require us to further reduce the prices of our products  affect our ability to recover costs or result in reduced gross margins 
demand for our products may decrease if our customers experience difficulty manufacturing  marketing or selling their products 
our products are used as components in our customers products 
accordingly  demand for our products is subject to factors affecting the ability of our customers to successfully introduce and market their products  including the competition our customers face in their particular industries  the technical  manufacturing  sales and marketing and management capabilities of our customers  the financial and other resources of our customers  and the inability of our customers to sell their products if they infringe third party intellectual property rights 
if demand for the end user applications for which our products are used decreases  or our customers are unable to develop  market and sell their products  demand for our products will decrease 
the financial condition of our customers may affect their ability to pay amounts owed to us 
many of our customers are facing business downturns that have reduced their cash balances and their prospects 
we frequently allow our customers to pay for products we ship to them within to days after delivery 
subsequent to our shipping a product  some customers have been unable to make payments as due  reducing our cash balances and causing us to incur charges to allow for a possibility that some accounts might not be paid 
during  a customer of one agent filed for bankruptcy protection 
we incurred a charge equal to the amount owed us and believe that there is a substantial likelihood that we will be able to recoup little  if any  of the this amount 
other customers may also be forced to file for bankruptcy 
if our customers do not pay their accounts when due  we will be required to incur charges that would reduce our earnings 
we purchase critical raw materials and parts for our equipment from single or limited sources  and could lose sales if these sources fail to fill our needs 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials  components and equipment used in manufacturing our products  including key materials such as quartz tubing  polishing solutions  and paralytic boron nitride 
although several of these raw materials are purchased from suppliers in whom we hold an ownership interest  we generally purchase these materials through standard purchase orders and not pursuant to long term supply contracts and no supplier guarantees supply of raw materials or equipment to us 
if we lose any of our key suppliers  our manufacturing efforts could be significantly hampered and we could be prevented from timely producing and delivering products to our customers 
we have in the past experienced delays obtaining critical raw materials and spare parts  including gallium  due to shortages of these materials 
although we hope to alleviate some of these delays and shortages as a result of our interests in our joint ventures  we may experience delays due to shortages of materials and may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of materials 
these shortages and delays could result in higher materials costs and cause us to delay or reduce production of our products 
if we have to delay or reduce production  we could fail to meet customer delivery schedules and our revenue and operating results could suffer 
we have made and may continue to make strategic investments in raw materials suppliers  which may not be successful and may result in the loss of all or part of our investment 
through fiscal  we have recorded investments in raw material suppliers in china  that provide us with opportunities to gain supply of key raw materials that are important to our substrate business 
these affiliates each have a market beyond that provided by us 
we do not have influence over all of these companies  each of which is located in china  and in some we have made only a strategic  minority investment 
we may not be successful in achieving the financial  technological or commercial advantage upon which any given investment is premised  and we could end up losing all or part of our investment 
the loss of one or more of our key substrate customers would significantly hurt our operating results 
a small number of substrate customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our total revenue 
our top five customers represented   and of product revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from a limited number of substrate customers 
our customers are not obligated to purchase a specified quantity of our products or to provide us with binding forecasts of product purchases 
in addition  our customers may reduce  delay or cancel orders at any time without any significant penalty  and during the past year  we have experienced slower bookings  significant push outs and cancellation of orders from some customers 
in addition  several of our previously large customers have stopped operations entirely 
if we lose a major customer or if a customer cancels  reduces or delays orders  our revenue would decline 
in addition  customers that have accounted for significant revenue in the past may not continue to generate revenue for us in any future period 
any delay in scheduled shipments of our products could cause revenue to fall below our expectations and the expectations of market analysts or investors  causing our stock price to decline 
our substrate products have a long qualification cycle that makes it difficult to plan our expenses and forecast our results 
customers typically place orders with us for our substrate products three months to a year or more after our initial contact with them 
the sale of our products may be subject to delays due to our customers lengthy internal budgeting  approval and evaluation processes 
during this time  we may incur substantial expenses and expend sales  marketing and management efforts while the customers evaluate our products 
these expenditures may not result in sales of our products 
if we do not achieve anticipated sales in a period as expected  we may experience an unplanned shortfall in our revenue 
as a result  we may not be able to cover expenses  causing our operating results to vary 
in addition  if a customer decides not to incorporate our products into its initial design  we may not have another opportunity to sell products to this customer for many months or even years 
in the current competitive and economic climate  the average sales cycle for our products has lengthened even further and is expected to continue to make it difficult to accurately forecast our future sales 
we anticipate that sales of any future substrate products will also have lengthy sales cycles and will  therefore  be subject to risks substantially similar to those inherent in the lengthy sales cycle of our current substrate products 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  we may lose valuable assets or incur costly litigation 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademark and trade secret laws  non disclosure agreements and other intellectual property protection methods to protect our proprietary technology 
however  we believe that  due to the rapid pace of technological innovation in the markets for our products  our ability to establish and maintain a position of technology leadership also depends on the skills of our development personnel 
despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property  a third party could develop products or processes similar to ours 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products or design around our patents 
we believe that at least two of our competitors have begun to ship gaas substrates produced using a process similar to our vgf technique 
our competitors may also develop and patent improvements to the vgf technology upon which we rely  and thus may limit any exclusivity we enjoy by virtue of our patents or trade secrets 
it is possible that pending or future united states or foreign patent applications made by us will not be approved  that our issued patents will not protect our intellectual property  or that third parties will challenge the ownership rights or the validity of our patents 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states and it may be more difficult to monitor the use of our intellectual property 
our competitors may be able to legitimately ascertain non patented proprietary technology embedded in our systems 
if this occurs  we may not be able to prevent the development of technology substantially similar to ours 
we may have to resort to costly litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or know how or to determine their scope  validity or enforceability 
enforcing or defending our proprietary technology is expensive  could cause us to divert resources and may not prove successful 
our protective measures may prove inadequate to protect our proprietary rights  and if we fail to enforce or protect our rights  we could lose valuable assets 
for example  we have recently been involved in litigation with sumitomo electric industries  ltd 
sei in japan as well as interference actions in the united states 
we and sei approved a settlement of this litigation during the fourth quarter of and the litigation was withdrawn and we abandoned the interference proceeding 
we incurred an initial charge of approximately million and will have to pay ongoing royalties to sei on certain of our products 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from international sales  and our ability to sustain and increase our international sales involves significant risks 
our revenue growth depends in part on the expansion of our international sales and operations 
international sales represented and of our total revenue for fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
we expect that sales to customers outside the us will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue  particularly sales to customers in asia 
currently  an increasing percentage of our sales are to customers headquartered in asia 
certain manufacturing facilities and suppliers are also located outside the us managing our global operations presents challenges  including periodic regional economic downturns  trade balance issues  varying business conditions and demands  political instability  variations in enforcement of intellectual property and contract rights in different jurisdictions  differences in the ability to develop relationships with suppliers and other local businesses  changes in us and international laws and regulations including us export restrictions  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates  the ability to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations  cultural differences  shipping delays and terrorist acts or acts of war  among other risks 
many of these challenges are present in china  which represents a large potential market for semiconductor equipment and where we anticipate significant opportunity for growth 
global uncertainties with respect to i economic growth rates in various countries  ii sustainability of demand for electronics products  iii capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers  iv price weakness for certain semiconductor devices  and v political instability in regions where we have operations may also affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our dependence on international sales involves a number of risks  including changes in tariffs  import or export restrictions and other trade barriers  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  longer periods to collect accounts receivable  changes in export license requirements  political and economic instability  unexpected changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  and foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
our sales are denominated in us dollars  except for sales to our japanese and some taiwanese customers  which are denominated in japanese yen 
thus  increases in the value of the us dollar could increase the price of our products in non us markets and make our products more expensive than competitors products in these markets 
also  denominating some sales in japanese yen subjects us to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and the japanese yen 
the functional currencies of our japanese and chinese subsidiaries are the local currencies 
we incur transaction gains or losses resulting from consolidation of expenses incurred in local currencies for these subsidiaries  as well as in translation of the assets and liabilities of these assets at each balance sheet date 
if we do not effectively manage the risks associated with international sales  our revenue  cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we need to continue to improve or implement our systems  procedures and controls and may not receive favorable attestation of our internal control systems by our independent registered public accounting firm 
the new requirements adopted by the securities and exchange commission in response to the passage of the sarbanes oxley act of will require annual review and evaluation of our internal control systems  and attestation of these systems by our independent accountants 
we are currently reviewing our internal control procedures and considering further documentation of such procedures that may be necessary 
although the guidelines for the evaluation and attestation of internal control systems have been finalized  the evaluation and attestation processes are new and untested 
therefore  we can give no assurances that our systems will satisfy the new requirements of the securities and exchange commission or that we will receive a favorable review and attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm 
in the past  periods of rapid growth and expansion has strained our management and other resources 
the expansion of our manufacturing capacity and the shift of manufacturing operations to china placed and continue to place a significant strain on our operations and management resources 
we recently upgraded our inventory control systems and may implement additional systems relating to consolidation of our financial results 
if we fail to manage these changes effectively  our operations may be disrupted 
to manage our business effectively  we may need to implement additional and improved management information systems  further develop our operating  administrative  financial and accounting systems and controls  add experienced senior level managers  and maintain close coordination among our executive  engineering  accounting  marketing  sales and operations organizations 
legislative actions  higher insurance costs and potential new accounting pronouncements are likely to cause our general and administrative expenses to increase and impact our future financial position and results of operations 
in order to comply with rules and regulations adopted pursuant to the sarbanes oxley act of by the sec  as well as changes to listing standards adopted by nasdaq  and accounting changes adopted affecting accounting for stock based compensation we may be required to increase our internal controls  hire additional personnel and additional outside legal  accounting and advisory services  all of which will cause our general and administrative costs to increase 
insurers may increase premiums as a result of the high claims rates they incurred over the past year 
changes in the accounting rules  including legislative and other rules to account for employee stock options as a compensation expense among others  could materially increase the expense that we report under generally accepted accounting principles and adversely affect our operating results 
if we fail to manage periodic contractions  we may utilize our cash balances and our existing cash and cash equivalent balances could decline 
we anticipate that our existing cash resources will fund any anticipated operating losses  purchases of capital equipment and provide adequate working capital for the next twelve months 
however  our liquidity is affected by many factors including  among others  the extent to which we pursue additional capital expenditures  the level of our production  and other factors related to the uncertainties of the industry and global economies 
if we fail to manage our contractions successfully we may draw down our cash reserves  which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition  reduce our value and may impinge our ability to raise debt and equity funding in the future  at a time when we may be required to raise additional cash 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that events in the future will not require us to seek additional capital  or  if so required  that such capital will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
as part of our effort to reduce costs  we may lose key staff  production resources  and technology that we will need to grow when end markets recover 
these events could reduce our ability to grow profitably as markets recover 
we anticipate that our existing cash resources will fund any anticipated operating losses  purchases of capital equipment and provide adequate working capital for the next twelve months 
our liquidity is affected by many factors including  among others  the extent to which we pursue additional capital expenditures  the level of our production efforts  and other factors related to the uncertainties of the industry and global economies 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that events in the future will not require us to seek additional capital sooner  or  if so required  that such capital will be available on terms acceptable to us if at all 
changes in china s political  social and economic environment may affect our financial performance 
our financial performance may be affected by changes in china s political  social and economic environment 
the role of the chinese central and local governments in the chinese economy is significant 
chinese policies toward economic liberalization  and laws and policies affecting technology companies  foreign investment  currency exchange rates and other matters could change  resulting in greater restrictions on our ability to do business and operate our manufacturing facilities in china 
any imposition of surcharges or any increase in chinese tax rates could hurt our operating results 
the chinese government could revoke  terminate or suspend our license for national security and similar reasons without compensation to us 
if the government of china were to take any of these actions  we would be prevented from conducting all or part of our business 
any failure on our part to comply with governmental regulations could result in the loss of our ability to manufacture our products in china 
china has from time to time experienced instances of civil unrest and hostilities 
confrontations have occurred between the military and civilians 
events of this nature could influence the chinese economy  result in nationalization of foreign owned operations such as ours  and could negatively affect our ability to operate our facilities in china 
a reoccurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars or the outbreak of a different contagious disease may adversely impact our manufacturing operations and some of our key suppliers and customers 
the majority of our substrate manufacturing activities are conducted in china 
in addition  we source key raw materials  including gallium  from our joint ventures and other suppliers in china 
the sars outbreak was most notable in china and a small number of cases were reported in one employee at our led production facility in china contracted sars in late april prompting us to close the facility for ten days 
there was no significant impact to our ability to fill customer orders 
if there were to be another outbreak of sars or a different contagious disease and if our employees contracted the disease  we may be required to temporarily close our manufacturing operations 
similarly  if one of our key suppliers is required to close for an extended period  we may not have enough raw material inventory to continue manufacturing operations 
in addition  while we possess management skills among our china staff that enable us to maintain our manufacturing operations with minimal on site supervision from our us based staff  our business could also be harmed if travel to or from asia and the united states is restricted or inadvisable  as it was during parts of none of our substrate competitors is as dependent on manufacturing facilities in china as we are 
if our manufacturing operations were closed for a significant period  we could lose revenue and market share during that period which would depress our financial performance and could be difficult to recapture 
finally  if one of our key customers is required to close for an extended period  we may not be able to ship product to them  our revenue would decline and our financial performance would suffer 
the effect of terrorist threats and actions on the general economy could decrease our revenues 
the united states continues to be on alert for terrorist activity 
the potential near and long term impact terrorist activities may have in regards to our suppliers  customers and markets for our products and the us economy are uncertain 
there may be embargos of ports or products  or destruction of shipments or our facilities  or attacks that affect our personnel 
there may be other potential adverse effects on our operating results due to a significant event that we cannot foresee 
since we perform substantially all of our manufacturing operations in china  and a significant portion of our customers are located outside of the untied states  terrorist activity or threats against us owned enterprise are a particular concern to us 
any future acquisitions may disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value or distract management attention 
as part of our strategy  we may consider acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses that offer products  services and technologies complementary to ours 
acquisitions entail numerous risks  including we may have difficulty assimilating the operations  products and personnel of the acquired businesses  our ongoing business may be disrupted  we may incur unanticipated costs  our management may be unable to manage the financial and strategic position of acquired or developed products  services and technologies  we may be unable to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures  and policies  and our relationships with employees and customers may be impaired as a result of any integration 
for example  we incurred substantial costs in connection with our acquisition of lyte optronics in may  including the assumption of approximately million of debt  which was subsequently repaid  resulting in a decline of cash available 
we also incurred consistent operating losses for the business following the acquisition  and have discontinued all operations and sold the related assets acquired in our acquisition of lyte optronics during to the extent that we issue shares of our stock or other rights to purchase stock in connection with any future acquisitions  dilution to our existing stockholders will result and our earnings per share may suffer 
any future acquisitions may not generate additional revenue or provide any benefit to our business 
if any of our facilities is damaged by actions such as fire  explosion  or natural disaster  we may not be able to manufacture our products 
the ongoing operation of our manufacturing and production facilities in china is critical to our ability to meet demand for our products 
if we are not able to use all or a significant portion of our facilities for prolonged periods for any reason  we will not be able to manufacture products for our customers 
for example  a natural disaster  fire or explosion caused by our use of combustible chemicals and high temperatures during our manufacturing processes would render some or all of our facilities inoperable for an indefinite period of time 
actions outside of our control  such as earthquakes  could also damage our facilities  rendering them inoperable 
if we are unable to operate our facilities and manufacture our products  we will lose customers and revenue and our business will be harmed 
unpredictable fluctuations in our operating results could disappoint analysts or our investors  which could cause our stock price to decline 
we have not over the past year been able to sustain growth  and may not be able to return to historic growth levels in the current economic environment 
our net loss in was the largest in our history and our losses continued during and we have and may continue to experience significant fluctuations in our revenue and earnings 
our quarterly and annual revenue and operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors  including our ability to develop  manufacture and deliver high quality products in a timely and cost effective manner  decline in general economic conditions or downturns in the industry in which we compete  fluctuations in demand for our products  expansion of our manufacturing capacity  expansion of our operations in china  limited availability and increased cost of raw materials  the volume and timing of orders from our customers  and cancellations  push outs and delays of customer orders  fluctuation of our manufacturing yields  decreases in the prices of our competitors products  costs incurred in connection with any future acquisitions of businesses or technologies  and increases in our expenses  including expenses for research and development 
due to these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful indicators of our future performance 
our operating results have over the past year at times been below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if this occurs again in future periods  the price of our common stock could decline or fluctuate 
a substantial percentage of our operating expenses are fixed in the short term and we may be unable to adjust spending to compensate for an unexpected shortfall in revenues 
as a result  any delay in generating revenue could cause our operating results to be below the expectations of market analysts or investors  which could also cause our stock price to fall 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile 
our stock price has fluctuated significantly since we began trading on the nasdaq national market 
for the twelve months ended december   the high and low closing sales prices of our common stock were and  respectively 
a number of factors could cause the price of our common stock to continue to fluctuate substantially  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results  changes in expectations about our future financial performance or changes in financial estimates of securities analysts  announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors  new product introduction by us or our competitors  large customer orders or order cancellations  and the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
we have adopted certain anti takeover measures that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of shares of preferred stock  while potentially providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and for other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
we have no present intention to issue shares of preferred stock 
on april   our board of directors adopted a preferred stock purchase rights plan intended to guard against certain takeover tactics 
the adoption of this plan was not in response to any proposal to acquire us  and the board is not aware of any such effort 
the existence of this plan could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
in addition  certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a merger  acquisition or change of control of us  or changes in our management  including the division of our board of directors into three separate classes  each with three year terms  the right of our board to elect a director to fill a space created by a board vacancy or the expansion of the board  the ability of our board to alter our bylaws  the ability of our board to authorize the issuance of up to  shares of blank check preferred stock  and the requirement that only our board or the holders of at least of our outstanding shares may call a special meeting of our stockholders 
furthermore  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
these provisions prohibit large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of the outstanding voting stock  from consummating a merger or combination with a corporation unless of the shares of voting stock not owned by these large stockholders approve the merger or combination  or the board of directors approves the merger or combination or the transaction which resulted in the large stockholder owning or more of our outstanding voting stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we use short term forward exchange contracts for hedging purposes to reduce the effects of adverse foreign exchange rate movements 
we have purchased foreign exchange contracts to hedge against certain trade accounts receivable denominated in japanese yen 
the change in the fair value of the forward contracts is recognized as part of the related foreign currency transactions as they occur 
as of december   we had no outstanding commitments with respect to foreign exchange contracts

these investments are reviewed for other than temporary declines in value on a quarterly basis 
reasons for other than temporary declines in value include whether the related company would have insufficient cash flow to operate for the next twelve months  significant changes in the operating performance and changes in market conditions 
in  we recorded  in charges in connection with an impairment write down of our investments 
in  we recorded million in charges to write down our investment in two private us companies 
as of december   the minority investments we continue to hold totaled million
