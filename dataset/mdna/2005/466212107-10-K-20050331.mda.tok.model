item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview jmar technologies  inc is a leading innovator in the development of laser based equipment for imaging  analysis and fabrication at the nano scale 
the company is leveraging over a decade of laser and photonics research to develop a diverse portfolio of products with commercial applications in rapidly growing industries while continuing to carry out research and development for the us defense advanced research projects agency darpa and support for the us government s defense microelectronics activity dmea semiconductor fabrication facility 
jmar is targeting the nanotechnology  bioscience and semiconductor industries with its britelight tm laser  x ray light source  compact x ray microscope for d visualization of single cells and polymers  and its x ray nano probe enabling interaction  analysis and materials modification at the nano scale 
jmar also develops  manufactures and markets its biosentry tm microorganism early warning system and maintains a strategic alliance for the production of the read chemical sensor for homeland security  environmental and utility infrastructure industries 
sources of revenue currently  over percent of the company s revenues are derived as the prime contractor or subcontractor for government contracts 
these contracts have generated intellectual property owned by the company with limited residual rights held by the government in areas in which the company believes there are significant commercial applications 
the most significant ongoing contract has been the contract issued to jmar s research division by the us army research laboratory sponsored by darpa for further development of the company s cpl system darpa contract 
a total of million has been funded under this contract  including million funded in february no program funding related to the darpa contract is included in the united states government s fiscal year budget and the company expects no further funding under this contract 
jmar s next most significant contract is a million contract issued to jmar s vermont operations by naval air warfare center ad to procure sub nm feature size x ray masks used in the development and production of high performance gaas mmics  and to produce zone plate optics navair contract 
through december   a total of million has been received under this contract 
the company expects to receive the remaining funding of the navair contract and a new contract to further the work in the third major ongoing revenue source involves the subcontract between jmar s microelectronics division and general dynamics advanced information systems gdais to enhance and maintain the semiconductor wafer fabrication processes installed at the mcclellan air force base in sacramento for the dmea gdais contract 
this work  which started in  has resulted in a new subcontract each year out of funds available in the dmea s budget as an element of the department of defense s advanced technology support program 
the company received million and million in contracts in and  respectively  for this program and expects further funding in unrelated to jmar s britelight and x ray source technology  we are preparing to enter the drinking water  food and beverage and homeland security markets with our new biosentry tm sensor product 
the biosentry sensor provides continuous monitoring of drinking water for microorganisms 
this product has successfully passed proof of concept testing and we have assembled beta units for installation at various beta sites in the first and second quarters of in early march  we entered into a technology testing and contingent purchase agreement with olivenhain municipal water district omwd which provides for the installation and testing of three beta models of the biosentry sensor at omwd s water treatment plant in san diego county 
if the biosentry beta units satisfy certain test criteria 
table of contents during a six month test period  including approval by the state regulator  omwd has agreed to purchase three production units 
we installed the first beta test units at omwd shortly before the end of the first quarter of through our collaboration with femtotrace  inc  we are also involved in the market for chemical sensors 
jmar has designed  manufactured  and integrated two alpha versions of the read sensor  a highly sensitive chemical detection system under contract for femtotrace 
jmar expects to manufacture a number of beta units for femtotrace in and is discussing the terms of an agreement to act as contract manufacturer for the production units of femtotrace s read sensor product line 
opportunities  challenges and risks in  we conducted several iron man tests of the beta version of our x ray lithography light source and stepper system to demonstrate the performance of our cpl technology in an effort to convince the semiconductor industry of the value of cpl technology for semiconductor fabrication 
while we believe that jmar s cpl technology may show its value to the gallium arsenide semiconductor industry in the future  jmar faces a number of challenges and risks involving the cpl technology  product design  manufacturing cost  infrastructure readiness  industry momentum  financing  and competition from substitute lithography technologies 
the continuation of this work is dependent on continued funding by our darpa contract  as well as financing and other support provided by one or more strategic partners 
no program funding related to cpl was included in the united states government s fiscal year budget  and the company expects no further government funding for this work 
to date  jmar has been unable to find any strategic partners to support commercialization of its cpl technology 
with the future prospects of its cpl product development program uncertain and with the benefit of a substantial investment in intellectual property related to soft x ray generation  in jmar implemented a new strategy to balance  diversify and expand its revenue base through new product development and technology acquisition 
we are now complementing our progress in product development and market validation with preparation for manufacturing and distribution 
in pursuit of this new strategy  jmar has identified other  more immediate  commercial opportunities for our laser and x ray technology  namely compact x ray microscope and x ray nano probe products 
jmar has also acquired new technology in multi angle light scattering and is developing biosentry products we can deliver in to several high growth rate industries 
jmar intends to continue to pursue government funding in areas that create valuable technology to support its new product development efforts 
the xrm  xnp and biosentry development activities are described in more detail in business products and services above 
as jmar seeks to add commercial revenues to our predominately government contract revenue base  we face a series of challenges  including technical and market risks and uncertainties associated with the development of new technologies and new products 
our product development efforts will require substantial continued investment by jmar and we expect to face challenges in transitioning each of our new products from the proof of concept  alpha and beta stages to commercial introduction and market acceptance 
see factors that may affect future results below for more information on the risks and uncertainties faced by jmar 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively  the majority of which were contract revenues 
revenues by segment for and were as follows 
table of contents research division vermont operations microelectronics division sensor products group the decrease in revenues for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to a decrease of  in the navair contract revenues at the vermont operations due to the delay in receipt of funding on that contract  a decrease of  in revenues of the research division and vermont operations related to the darpa contract  a decrease of  related to two contracts at the vermont operations that have been completed and a decrease of  in contract revenues at the microelectronics division related to reduced equipment installations under the gdais contract in the lower revenues for the darpa contract in is primarily related to lower funding in and compared to  resulting in a lower darpa contract backlog entering compared to fiscal year  exacerbated by the fact that no additional program funding related to the darpa contract was included in the us government fiscal year budget and no further funding under this contract is expected beyond the funds received in february revenues for the three months ended december  and were  and  respectively 
despite the lower revenues for the three months ended december  compared to the corresponding period in  receivables at december  were  compared to  at december  the higher then expected receivables at december  is due to the continued delay in receipt of funding for the darpa contract million was received in february  the timing of billings for the navair contract in compared to and because of advanced billings allowed under the navair contract in resulting in billings in excess of costs incurred at december   and the timing of billings at the microelectronics division 
because of the receipt of the million of darpa funding in february  the company expects the higher than normal accounts receivable in relation to revenues to normalize starting in the quarter ended june  the company will continue to experience flat revenues for until sales from our new products are realized 
losses 
the net loss for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
the loss from continuing operations for those same periods was  and  respectively  while the loss from operations for those same periods was  and  respectively

included in the net loss and loss from continuing operations for the years ended december  and is a non cash interest charge of  and  respectively see interest and other expenses below 
gross margins 
gross margins for the fiscal years ended december  and were and  respectively 
the company s margins are low because the majority of its revenues are from contract revenues  which inherently generate lower margins than product revenues 
the primary decrease in the gross margin for the year ended december  compared to the prior year is due to a contract reserve of  for the year ended december  related to a contract at the vermont operations and inventory reserves of approximately  for the year ended december   also at the vermont operations 
these reductions were offset in part by lower revenues in on the lower margin navair contract ie  the lower margin navair contract represented a greater percentage of revenues in 
the low margins on the navair contract were due to the high subcontract component of that contract and the company s absorption of some of the costs incurred due to limited funding on that contract 
the majority of the company s revenues for will be derived from contracts  
table of contents so gross margins are expected to continue at similar levels increased somewhat by higher gross margins expected later in from sales of biosentry products 
the company is investing in new product development activities that it believes will lead to higher margin products in the future 
selling  general and administrative sg a 
sg a expenses for the fiscal years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the increase in sg a expenses for was primarily attributable to sg a costs of the sensor products group formed in of  higher accounting and insurance costs of  and higher payroll related costs of  these increases were offset in part by a reduction in sg a costs of the vermont operations due to staff and other cost reductions of  research  development and engineering program rd e 
the company s rd e consists of two types customer funded rd e us government and other companies and company funded rd e 
both types of rd e costs are expensed when incurred

the decrease in customer funded rd e expenditures for consists of a decrease of  related to the navair contract  a decrease of  related to the darpa contract and decreases in two contracts completed in at the vermont operations of company funded rd e costs associated with product development are shown in operating expenses and totaled  and  for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in is due to product development started in for our biosentry  xrm and xnp new products 
total rd e expenditures for and were  and  respectively 
total rd e expenditures as a percentage of revenues were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the rd e expenditures as a percentage of revenues have been historically higher than that for a commercially oriented company because much of the company s revenues has been r d contract revenues 
during  jmar has been implementing its strategy to balance  diversify and expand its revenue base through new product development and to acquire or license products  technologies or businesses 
specifically  during the second quarter of the company started product development on the biosentry product line  and during the third quarter of  the company initiated the product development of the x ray microscope and x ray nano probe product lines

conversions to equity are offset against the required repayments 
except for the conversion price  the conversion terms of the series e through h preferred stock are the same as the conversion terms of the working capital line see below 
on february   the company entered into agreements with laurus to amend the company s series e  f  g and h convertible preferred stock the amendments 
the amendments provide for the deferral of approximately million in monthly redemption payments  as follows a payments of the remaining months of redemption payments  per month for the series e preferred stock are deferred until july   and b the next months of redemption payments due under the series f  g and h convertible preferred stock  per month are deferred until february   the grant of a right to the company to elect to pay the originally scheduled monthly redemption payments with shares of the company s common stock valued at a discount to the then market price  and the reduction in the conversion prices of the series e h preferred stock originally ranging from to to per share 
the monthly redemption payments under the series f h preferred stock will recommence in august  until january   with the balance of approximately million in the stated amount of the series f h preferred stock due in february  these redemption payments will be reduced to the extent that there are conversions of the preferred stock into common stock 
in connection with all of the above financing transactions with laurus working capital line and series a h preferred stock issuances  the company issued warrants to laurus to purchase a total of  shares of common stock at prices ranging from to 
in addition  laurus was granted the right to receive a warrant to purchase one share of common stock at for every of principal of the working capital line that is converted to equity up to a total of  shares

working capital line 
in march  the company entered into a revolving fixed price convertible note working capital line with laurus 
as of december   there was no amount outstanding under the working capital line 
the working capital line allows the company to borrow from time to time up to of eligible accounts receivable of the company to a maximum of million 
advances in excess of this formula are allowed  however  with the consent of laurus 
laurus can convert any portion of the principal outstanding to common stock at a fixed price per share conversion price any time the market price of the company s common stock is in excess of the conversion price 
the company can convert a portion of the principal outstanding to common stock at the conversion price if 
table of contents the market price of the company s common stock averages of the conversion price or higher for consecutive trading days 
the initial terms of the working capital line provided that after million of conversions into equity  the conversion price would be increased 
the conversion price initially was  but was increased to in january after million of the working capital line had been converted 
the interest rate on the working capital line is equal to the prime rate at december  plus percent  subject to a floor of percent 
accrued interest is payable monthly 
the working capital line requires that the company s quick ratio  as defined  be or higher 
the quick ratio is defined as the sum of cash and accounts receivable divided by the sum of current liabilities  exclusive of current liabilities of discontinued operations 
the company s quick ratio was at december  the term of the working capital line runs until march  the available borrowings under the working capital line were approximately million at december   all of which was unused at december  cash used in continuing operations 
cash used in continuing operations was  in compared to  in the loss from continuing operations net of non cash items depreciation  amortization  debt discount  services received in exchange for common stock or warrants  and patent and equipment write downs was  and  in and  respectively 
the higher use of cash in continuing operations in is primarily due to lower revenues resulting in a lower gross profit in compared to of  and higher product development costs in compared to of  the company expects revenues to continue at the levels experienced in until its commercial products enter the marketplace later in in addition  product development expenditures will increase in as the company s product development activities accelerate 
helping cash flow from operations in was an increase in billings in advance of incurring related costs of  related to several of the company s contracts and orders  primarily the navair contract related to milestones achieved in december customer deposits decreased by  in related to a large deposit the company received on one of its contracts in this contract was completed in and the company expects no further customer deposits of that magnitude 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased by  in primarily because of the company s better liquidity position as a result of the financings in march and because of costs incurred in on one of the company s contracts for which a reserve was established in the decrease in billings in excess of costs incurred in of  was due to milestone billings in allowed pursuant to two contracts 
cash used in discontinued operations

goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january   the company has established reporting units and applies a two step fair value approach to evaluating goodwill impairment  using at least an annual assessment 
the company compares the fair value of the business unit with the carrying amount of the assets associated with the business unit 
the fair value of each business unit is determined using a risk adjusted discount rate to compute a net present value of estimated future cash flows and a consideration of market capitalization of the company 
the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 

table of contents management performed an interim evaluation of goodwill as of june  following notification that no additional funding was included in the government s fiscal year budget 
a further evaluation of goodwill was performed again as of december  the business units currently identified are vermont operations research division  microelectronics division and sensor products group 
all of the company s goodwill arose from the acquisition of sal  inc the predecessor to the vermont operations and is allocated to the vermont operations research division business unit 
the research division and vermont operations are viewed as one business unit due to the interrelations of their businesses ie  x ray source related commercialization  including the xrm and xnp products  with the source and technology development coming from the research division and the product design  manufacturing engineering  integration  testing and manufacturing performed by the vermont operation  as well as the zone plate optics development and manufacturing for the xrm and xnp performed by the vermont operations 
additionally  the vermont operations will use its core capabilities to perform manufacturing for other products of the company  as well as performing contract manufacturing for other companies products 
the discounted cash flow analysis is based on a year projection of revenue  operating expenses  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements and a continuity value of times the th year cash flow 
the discount rate used for the most recent analysis is  taking into account the riskiness of the new products 
sensitivity analysis is also performed to determine the appropriateness of the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis 
as a majority of the company s expected revenues in the future are based on products that are currently under development  the company estimates the expected revenues based on its current knowledge of the market and our expectations of successfully penetrating those markets 
if our future cash flows vary significantly from our assumptions we may record an impairment of goodwill 
the market capitalization test is used as a complementary test to the discounted cash flow analysis 
the company estimates its market capitalization based on the average stock price over the preceding year and estimates the three business units relative contribution to the market value of the company based on shareholder inquiries  emphasis by the company in discussions with shareholders and others  and emphasis in formal shareholder communications ie  press releases 
capitalized patent costs are amortized over ten years  and other intangible assets are amortized over not more than five years

 the company records a beneficial conversion feature bcf related to the issuance of convertible preferred stock and convertible debt that have conversion features at fixed rates that are in the money when issued and records the fair value of warrants issued with those instruments 
the bcf for the convertible instruments is recognized and measured by allocating a portion of the proceeds to warrants and as a reduction to the carrying amount of the convertible instrument equal to the intrinsic value of the conversion features both of which are credited to paid in capital
