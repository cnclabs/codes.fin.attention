item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this section provides management s discussion of the financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations of atmos energy corporation with specific information on results of operations and liquidity and capital resources 
it includes management s interpretation of our financial results  the factors affecting these results  the major factors expected to affect future operating results and future investment and financing plans 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
cautionary statement for the purposes of the safe harbor under the private securities litigation reform act of the statements contained in this annual report on form k may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report are forward looking statements made in good faith by the company and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of when used in this report  or any other of the company s documents or oral presentations  the words anticipate  believe  expect  estimate  forecast  goal  intend  objective  plan  projection  seek  strategy or similar words are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements relating to the company s strategy  operations  markets  services  rates  recovery of costs  availability of gas supply and other factors 
these risks and uncertainties include the following adverse weather conditions  such as warmer than normal weather in the company s utility service territories or colder than normal weather that could adversely affect our natural gas marketing activities  regulatory trends and decisions  including deregulation initiatives and the impact of rate proceedings before various state regulatory commissions  market risks beyond our control affecting our risk management activities including market liquidity  commodity price volatility and counterparty creditworthiness  national  regional and local economic conditions  the company s ability to continue to access the capital markets  the effects of inflation and changes in the availability and prices of natural gas  including the volatility of natural gas prices  increased competition from energy suppliers and alternative forms of energy  risks relating to the acquisition of the txu gas operations  including without limitation  the company s increased indebtedness resulting from the acquisition of the txu gas operations  the impact of recent natural disasters on our operations  especially hurricane katrina  and other uncertainties discussed herein  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the company 
accordingly  while the company believes these forward looking statements to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized 
further  the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any of its forward looking statements whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
factors that may affect our future performance our performance in the future will primarily depend on the results of our utility and nonutility operations 
several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance  some of which are described below 
they should be considered in connection with evaluating forward looking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in these forward looking statements 
our operations are weather sensitive 
weather is one of the most significant factors influencing our performance 
our natural gas utility sales volumes and related revenues are correlated with heating requirements that result from cold winter weather 
our agricultural sales volumes are associated with the rainfall levels during the growing season in our 
table of contents west texas and kansas irrigation markets 
although weather normalized rates in effect in several of our jurisdictions should mitigate the adverse effects of warmer than normal weather on our utility operating results  approximately fifteen to twenty percent of our utility gross profit margin is sensitive to weather  particularly our louisiana and mid tex divisions 
this means we will not be able to increase customers bills to offset lower gas usage when the weather is warmer than normal 
our mid tex division operations benefit from a rate structure that combines a monthly customer charge with a declining block rate schedule to partially mitigate the impact of warmer than normal weather on revenue 
the combination of the monthly customer charge and the customer billing under the first block of the declining block rate schedule provides for the recovery of most of our fixed costs for such operations under most weather conditions 
however  this rate structure is not as beneficial during periods where weather is significantly warmer than normal 
finally  sustained cold weather could adversely affect our natural gas marketing operations as we may be required to purchase gas at spot rates in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill some customer contracts 
we are subject to regulation which can directly impact our operations 
our natural gas utility business is subject to various regulated returns on its rate base in each of the states in which we operate 
we monitor the allowed rates of return  our effectiveness in earning such rates and initiate rate proceedings or operating changes as needed 
in addition  in the normal course of the regulatory environment  assets are placed in service and historical test periods are established before rate cases can be filed 
once rate cases are filed  regulatory bodies have the authority to suspend implementation of the new rates while studying the cases 
because of this process  we must temporarily suffer the negative financial effects of having placed assets in service without the benefit of rate relief  which is commonly referred to as regulatory lag 
in addition  once our rates have been approved  they are still subject to challenge for their reasonableness by appropriate regulatory authorities 
also  our debt and equity financings are also subject to approval by regulatory bodies in certain states  which could limit our ability to take advantage of favorable short term market conditions 
our business could also be affected by deregulation initiatives  including the development of unbundling initiatives in the natural gas industry 
unbundling is the separation of the provision and pricing of local distribution gas services into discrete components 
it typically focuses on the separation of the distribution and gas supply components and the resulting opening of the regulated components of sales services to alternative unregulated suppliers of those services 
because of our enhanced technology and distribution system infrastructures  we believe that we are now positively positioned should unbundling evolve 
consequently  we expect there would be no significant adverse effect on our business should unbundling or further deregulation of the natural gas distribution service business occur 
finally  contractual limitations could adversely affect our ability to withdraw gas from storage  which could cause us to purchase gas at spot prices in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill customer contracts 
we seek to minimize this risk by increasing our storage capacity and enhancing the flexibility of our natural gas marketing contracts 
our operations are exposed to market risks that are beyond our control  which could result in financial losses 
our risk management operations in our natural gas marketing segment are subject to market risks beyond our control including market liquidity  commodity price volatility and counterparty creditworthiness 
market liquidity is affected by the number of trading partners in the market 
although we maintain a risk management policy  we may not be able to completely offset the price risk associated with volatile gas prices or the risk in our gas trading activities which could lead to financial losses 
physical trading also introduces price risk on any net open positions at the end of each trading day  as well as a risk of loss resulting from intra day fluctuations of gas prices and the potential for daily price movements 
table of contents between the time natural gas is purchased or sold for future delivery and the time the related purchase or sale is hedged 
although we manage our business to maintain no open positions  at times  limited net open positions related to our physical storage may occur on a short term basis 
the determination of our net open position as of any day requires us to make assumptions as to future circumstances  including the use of gas by our customers in relation to our anticipated storage and market positions 
because the price risk associated with any net open position at the end of each day may increase if the assumptions are not realized  we review these assumptions as part of our daily monitoring activities 
net open positions may result in an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations if market prices move in an unfavorable manner 
our utility segment uses a combination of storage and financial hedges to partially insulate us against volatility in gas prices and to help moderate the effects of higher customer accounts receivable caused by higher gas prices 
our natural gas marketing segment manages margins and limits risk exposure on the sale of natural gas inventory or the offsetting fixed price purchase or sale commitments for physical quantities of natural gas through the use of a variety of financial derivatives 
we could realize financial losses on these activities as a result of volatility in the market value of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract 
further  the use of financial instruments to conduct our hedging and market risk activities subjects us to counterparty risk 
adverse changes in the creditworthiness of our counterparties could limit the level of trading activities with these parties and increase the risk that these parties may not perform under a contract 
we believe this risk is mitigated due to the large number of counterparties used in our risk management activities 
our net periodic pension and other postretirement costs are subject to market risk as the fluctuation in the fair value of the assets used to fund our various benefit plans could lead to significant fluctuations in these costs 
finally  we are subject to interest rate risk on our commercial paper borrowings and floating rate debt 
we could experience higher interest expense if interest rates increase or increased volatility if short term interest rates become volatile 
national  regional and local economic conditions have a direct impact on our operations 
our operations are affected by the conditions and overall strength of the national  regional and local economies  including interest rates  changes in the capital markets and increases in the costs of our primary commodity  natural gas 
these factors impact the amount of residential  industrial and commercial growth in our service territories 
additionally  these factors could adversely impact our customer collections 
further  aem s operations are concentrated in the natural gas industry  and its customers and suppliers may be subject to economic risks affecting that industry 
the execution of our business plan could be affected by an inability to access financial markets 
we rely upon access to both short term and long term capital markets as a source of liquidity to satisfy our liquidity requirements 
although we believe we will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets  adverse changes in the economy  the overall health of the industries in which we operate and changes to our credit ratings could limit access to these markets and restrict the execution of our business plan 
our long term debt is currently rated as investment grade by standard poor s corporation s p  moody s investors service moody s and fitch ratings  inc fitch  the three credit rating agencies that rate our long term debt securities 
there can be no assurance that these rating agencies will maintain investment grade ratings for our long term debt 
if we were to lose our investment grade rating  the commercial paper markets and the commodity derivatives markets could become unavailable to us 
this would increase our borrowing costs for working capital and reduce the borrowing capacity of our gas marketing affiliate 
in addition  if our commercial paper ratings were lowered  it would increase the cost of commercial paper financing and could reduce or eliminate our ability to access the commercial paper markets 
if we are 
table of contents unable to issue commercial paper  we intend to borrow under our bank credit facilities to meet our working capital needs 
this would increase the cost of our working capital financing 
inflation and increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base and customer collections and increase our level of indebtedness 
inflation has caused increases in certain operating expenses and has required assets to be replaced at higher costs 
we have a process in place to continually review the adequacy of our utility gas rates in relation to the increasing cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in adjusting those gas rates 
historically  we have been able to budget and control operating expenses and investments within the amounts authorized to be collected in rates and intend to continue to do so 
the ability to control expenses is an important factor that will influence future results 
rapid increases in the price of purchased gas  which has occurred recently and in some prior years  causes us to experience a significant increase in short term debt because we must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased  which can be significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas delivered 
increases in purchased gas costs also slow our utility collection efforts as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills  leading to higher than normal accounts receivable 
this situation could result in higher short term debt levels and increased bad debt expense 
due to the significant increase in natural gas prices resulting primarily from the impact of recent natural disasters  we are anticipating increases in our short term debt  accounts receivable and bad debt expense during fiscal finally  higher costs of natural gas in recent years have already caused many of our utility customers to conserve in the use of our gas services and could lead to even more customers utilizing such conservation methods 
our operations are subject to increased competition 
we are facing increased competition from other energy suppliers as well as electric companies and from energy marketing and trading companies 
in the case of industrial customers  such as manufacturing plants  and agricultural customers  adverse economic conditions  including higher gas costs  could cause these customers to use alternative sources of energy  such as electricity  or bypass our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower per unit costs 
our pipeline and storage operations currently face limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation  storage and other services for customers 
however  competition may increase if new intrastate pipelines are constructed near our existing facilities 
we have only limited recourse under the acquisition agreement for losses relating to the txu gas acquisition 
the diligence conducted in connection with the txu gas acquisition and the indemnification provided in the acquisition agreement may not be sufficient to protect us from  or compensate us for  all losses resulting from the acquisition or txu gas s prior operations 
for example  under the terms of the acquisition agreement  the first million of many indemnifiable losses are to be borne by us  and the agreement provides for sharing of losses with respect to unknown environmental matters that may affect the assets we acquired after we have borne million in costs relating to such matters 
in addition  under the terms of the acquisition agreement  the maximum aggregate amount of such losses for which txu gas will indemnify us is approximately million 
a material loss associated with the txu gas acquisition for which there is not adequate indemnification could negatively affect our results of operations  our financial condition and our reputation in the industry  thereby reducing the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
recent natural disasters  especially hurricane katrina  have adversely impacted our operations 
on august   hurricane katrina struck the gulf coast  inflicting significant damage in our eastern louisiana operations 
the hardest hit areas in our service area were in jefferson  st 
tammany  
table of contents st 
bernard and plaquemines parishes 
in total  approximately  of our natural gas customers were affected in these areas 
a significant number of these customers will not require gas service for some time because of sustained damages 
we cannot predict with certainty how many of these customers will return to these service areas and over what time period 
additionally  we cannot accurately determine what regulatory actions  if any  may be taken by the regulators with respect to these areas 
finally  although we believe our insurance will cover all losses in excess of our deductibles  it is possible that certain of these losses may not be fully recoverable 
overview in fiscal  we earned million in net income or per diluted share  compared with net income of million  or per diluted share in fiscal the percent year over year increase in net income was primarily attributable to the incremental results we achieved from our mid tex and atmos pipeline texas divisions that we acquired on october  strong earnings in our natural gas marketing segment primarily attributable to favorable results from the management of our storage portfolio also contributed to the increase in net income 
these positive factors helped overcome the adverse effects on our utility segment of weather adjusted for wna that was percent warmer than normal  which reduced our net income by million  or per diluted share  and the impact of hurricane katrina  which reduced our net income by million  or per diluted share 
fiscal was highlighted by our acquisition of the natural gas distribution and pipeline operations of txu gas company 
the txu gas operations we acquired are regulated businesses engaged in the purchase  transmission  distribution and sale of natural gas in the north central  eastern and western parts of texas 
through these newly acquired operations  we provide gas distribution services to approximately million residential and business customers in texas  including the dallas fort worth metropolitan area 
we also now own and operate a system consisting of  miles of gas transmission and gathering lines and five underground storage reservoirs in texas 
the purchase price of the txu gas acquisition was approximately billion  before transaction costs and expenses  which we paid in cash 
we funded the purchase price for the txu gas acquisition with approximately million in net proceeds from our offering of approximately million shares of common stock  which we completed on july   and approximately billion in net proceeds from our issuance on october  of commercial paper backstopped by a senior unsecured revolving credit agreement  which we entered into on september  for bridge financing for the txu gas acquisition 
in october  we repaid the outstanding commercial paper used to fund the acquisition through the issuance of senior unsecured notes on october   which generated net proceeds of approximately billion and the sale of million shares of common stock on october   which generated net proceeds of approximately million 
as a result of the acquisition  effective october   we created the pipeline and storage segment which includes the regulated pipeline and storage operations of the atmos pipeline texas division and the nonregulated pipeline and storage operations of atmos pipeline and storage  llc  which was previously included in our other nonutility segment 

table of contents the txu gas acquisition essentially doubled the size of the company as measured by assets  revenues and customers

the increase reflects the impact of the acquisition of the mid tex operations million and the effect of rate increases in our west texas and mississippi jurisdictions that were not in effect during the first six months of fiscal  partially offset by weather adjusted for wna in our other utility operations that was five percent warmer than normal and one percent warmer than the prior year 
our natural gas marketing segment net income increased million during the year ended september  compared with the year ended september  the increase in natural gas marketing net income primarily reflects favorable results from the management of our storage portfolio partially offset by an unfavorable movement in the forward indices used to value our storage financial instruments 
our pipeline and storage segment contributed million in net income for the year ended september  compared with million for the year ended september   primarily reflecting the acquisition of the atmos pipeline texas division million 
our total debt to capitalization ratio at september  was percent compared with percent at september  reflecting the impact of the financing for the txu gas acquisition  partially offset by the repayment of million in principal of substantially all of our first mortgage bonds in june 
table of contents operating cash flow provided million compared with million  reflecting increased net income and more effective net working capital management partially offset by lower than expected utility sales volumes due to the effect of warmer weather 
capital expenditures increased to million from million primarily reflecting spending for the mid tex division million and the atmos pipeline texas division million 
our financial performance is discussed in greater detail below in results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we based our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to risk management and trading activities  allowance for doubtful accounts  legal and environmental accruals  insurance accruals  pension and postretirement obligations  deferred income taxes and the valuation of goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets 
our critical accounting policies are reviewed by the audit committee quarterly 
actual results may differ from estimates 
regulation our utility operations are subject to regulation with respect to rates  service  maintenance of accounting records and various other matters by the respective regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate 
our regulated utility operations are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
this statement requires cost based  rate regulated entities that meet certain criteria to reflect the financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions in their financial statements 
we record regulatory assets for costs that have been deferred for which future recovery through customer rates is considered probable 
regulatory liabilities are recorded when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers through the ratemaking process 
as a result  certain costs that would normally be expensed under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states are permitted to be capitalized because they can be recovered through rates 
further  regulation may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized 
the amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations 
the impact of regulation on our utility operations may be affected by decisions of the regulatory authorities or the issuance of new regulations 
revenue recognition sales of natural gas to our utility customers are billed on a monthly cycle basis  however  the billing cycle periods for certain classes of customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes 
we follow the revenue accrual method of accounting for utility segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to customers  but not yet billed under the cycle billing method  are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to expense 
rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for increases and decreases in our purchased gas cost through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms 
purchased gas adjustment mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case to address all of the utility s non gas costs 
these mechanisms are commonly utilized when regulatory authorities recognize a particular type of expense  such as purchased gas costs  that i is subject to significant price fluctuations compared to the utility s other costs  ii represents a large component of the utility s cost of service and iii is generally outside the control of the gas utility 
there is no gross profit generated through purchased gas adjustments  but they do provide a dollar for dollar offset to increases or decreases in utility gas costs 
although substantially all of our utility sales to our customers fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase  utility gross profit is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas due to the purchased gas adjustment mechanism 
the effects of these purchased gas adjustment mechanisms are recorded as deferred gas costs on our balance sheet 

table of contents energy trading contracts resulting in the delivery of a commodity where we are the principal in the transaction are recorded as natural gas marketing sales or purchases at the time of physical delivery 
realized gains and losses from the settlement of financial instruments that do not result in physical delivery related to our natural gas marketing energy trading contracts and unrealized gains and losses from changes in the market value of open contracts are included as a component of natural gas marketing revenues 
allowance for doubtful accounts for the majority of our receivables  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our collections experience 
on certain other receivables where we are aware of a specific customer s inability or reluctance to pay  we record an allowance for doubtful accounts against amounts due to reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to collect 
however  if circumstances change  our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be different 
circumstances which could affect our estimates include  but are not limited to  customer credit issues  the level of natural gas prices and general economic conditions 
derivatives and hedging activities in our utility segment  we use a combination of storage and financial derivatives to partially insulate us and our natural gas utility customers against gas price volatility during the winter heating season 
the financial derivatives we use in our utility segment are accounted for under the mark to market method pursuant to sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
changes in the valuation of these derivatives primarily result from changes in the valuation of the portfolio of contracts  maturity and settlement of contracts and newly originated transactions 
however  because the costs of financial derivatives used in our utility segment will ultimately be recovered through our rates  current period changes in the assets and liabilities from these risk management activities are recorded as a component of deferred gas costs in accordance with sfas accordingly  there is no earnings impact to our utility segment as a result of the use of financial derivatives 
the changes in the assets and liabilities from risk management activities are recognized in purchased gas cost in the income statement when the related costs are recovered through our rates 
our natural gas marketing risk management activities are conducted through aem 
aem is exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas  which we manage through a combination of storage and financial derivatives  including futures  over the counter and exchange traded options and swap contracts with counterparties 
option contracts provide the right  but not the requirement  to buy or sell the commodity at a fixed price 
swap contracts require receipt of payment for the commodity based on the difference between a fixed price and the market price on the settlement date 
the use of these contracts is subject to our risk management policies  which are monitored for compliance daily 
we participate in transactions in which we combine the natural gas commodity and transportation costs to minimize our costs incurred to serve our customers 
additionally  we engage in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit from pricing differences that occur over time 
we purchase or sell physical natural gas and then sell or purchase financial contracts at a price sufficient to cover our carrying costs and provide a gross profit margin 
through the use of transportation and storage services and derivatives  we are able to capture gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time 
under sfas  natural gas inventory is the hedged item in a fair value hedge and is marked to market monthly using the inside ferc iferc price at the end of each month 
changes in fair value are recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change 
costs to store the gas are recognized in the period the costs are incurred 
we recognize revenue and the carrying value of the inventory as an associated purchased gas cost in our consolidated statement of income when we sell the gas and deliver it out of the storage facility 
derivatives associated with our natural gas inventory are marked to market each month based upon the nymex price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change 
the difference in the indices used to mark to market our physical inventory iferc and the related fair value hedge nymex is reported as a component of revenue and can result in volatility in our reported net income 
over time  gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses on the fair value hedges  resulting in the realization of the economic gross profit margin we anticipated at the 
table of contents time we structured the original transaction 
in addition  we continually manage our positions to optimize value as market conditions and other circumstances change 
similar to our inventory position  we attempt to mitigate substantially all of the commodity price risk associated with our fixed price contracts with minimum volume requirements through the use of various offsetting derivatives 
prior to april   these derivatives were not designated as hedges under sfas because they naturally locked in the economic gross profit margin at the time we entered into the contract 
the fixed price forward and offsetting derivative contracts were marked to market each month with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses recorded in revenue in our consolidated statement of income 
the unrealized gains and losses were realized as a component of revenue in the period in which we fulfilled the requirements of the fixed price contract and the derivatives settled 
to the extent that the unrealized gains and losses of the fixed price forward contracts and the offsetting derivatives did not offset exactly  our earnings experienced some volatility 
at delivery  the gains and losses on the fixed price contracts were offset by gains and losses on the derivatives  resulting in the realization of the economic gross profit margin we anticipated at the time we structured the original transaction 
in addition  we continually managed our positions to optimize value as market conditions and other circumstances changed 
effective april   we elected to treat our fixed price forward contracts as normal purchases and sales 
as a result  we ceased marking the fixed price forward contracts to market 
we designated the offsetting derivative contracts as cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions 
as a result of this change  unrealized gains and losses on these open derivative contracts are now recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings as a component of revenue when the hedged volumes are sold 
hedge ineffectiveness  to the extent incurred  is reported as a component of revenue 
during fiscal  we entered into four treasury lock agreements to fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost of financing associated with the anticipated issuance of million of long term debt 
we designated these treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges of an anticipated transaction 
accordingly  unrealized gains and losses associated with the treasury lock agreements were recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
these treasury lock agreements were settled in october with a net million payment to the counterparties 
this realized loss will be recognized as a component of interest expense over the life of the related financing arrangements 
the fair value of our financial derivatives is determined through a combination of prices actively quoted on national exchanges  prices provided by other external sources and prices based on models and other valuation methods 
changes in the valuation of our financial derivatives primarily result from changes in market prices  the valuation of the portfolio of our contracts  maturity and settlement of these contracts and newly originated transactions  each of which directly affect the estimated fair value of our derivatives 
we believe the market prices and models used to value these derivatives represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and over the counter quotations  time value and volatility factors underlying the contracts 
values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under present market conditions 
impairment assessments we perform impairment assessments of our goodwill  intangible assets subject to amortization and long lived assets 
we currently have no indefinite lived intangible assets 
we annually evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during our second fiscal quarter or as impairment indicators arise 
we use a present value technique based on discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
we have determined our reporting units to be each of our utility divisions and wholly owned subsidiaries 
goodwill is allocated to the reporting units responsible for the acquisition that gave rise to the goodwill 
the discounted cash flow calculations used to assess goodwill impairment are dependent on several subjective factors including the timing of future cash flows  future growth rates and the discount rate 
an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its fair value 
we periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that our intangible assets subject to amortization and other long lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful 
table of contents life may warrant revision 
when such events or circumstances are present  we assess the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through expected future cash flows 
these cash flow projections consider various factors such as the timing of the future cash flows and the discount rate and are based upon the best information available at the time the estimate is made 
changes in these factors could materially affect the cash flow projections and result in the recognition of an impairment charge 
an impairment charge is recognized as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the related asset 
pension and other postretirement plans pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets  assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality data 
we review the estimates and assumptions underlying our pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities annually based upon a june measurement date 
the assumed discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities 
the assumed discount rate  the assumed health care cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities 
the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligation and net pension and postretirement cost 
when establishing our discount rate  we consider absolute high quality corporate bond rates based on moody s aa bond index  changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied discount rate that is derived from matching our projected benefit disbursements with a high quality corporate bond spot rate curve 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is utilized in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and postretirement plan cost 
we estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns  equity risk premiums  asset allocations  the effects of active plan management  the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance 
we also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate  that year s annual pension or postretirement plan cost is not affected 
rather  this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or postretirement plan cost over a period of approximately ten to twelve years 
we estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining our postretirement net expense based upon our actual health care cost experience  the effects of recently enacted legislation and general economic conditions 
our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our participant census information as of the measurement date 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension cost ultimately recognized 
a percent change in our discount rate will impact our pension and postretirement cost approximately million 
a percent change in our expected rate of return will impact our pension and postretirement cost by approximately million

year ended september  compared with year ended september  utility segment our utility segment has historically contributed to percent of our consolidated net income 
the primary factors that impact the results of our utility operations are seasonal weather patterns  competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas 
natural gas sales to residential  commercial and public authority customers are affected by winter heating season requirements 
this generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from october through march of each year and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from april through september of each year 
accordingly  our second fiscal quarter has historically been our most critical earnings quarter with an average of approximately percent of our consolidated net income having been earned in the second quarter during the three most recently completed fiscal years 
additionally  we typically experience higher levels of accounts receivable  accounts payable  gas stored underground and short term debt balances during the winter heating season due to the seasonal nature of our revenues and the need to purchase and store gas to support these operations 
utility sales to industrial customers are much less weather sensitive 
utility sales to agricultural customers  which typically use natural gas to power irrigation pumps during the period from march through september  are primarily affected by rainfall amounts and the price of natural gas 
changes in the cost of gas impact revenue but do not directly affect our gross profit from utility operations because the fluctuations in gas prices are passed through to our customers 
accordingly  we believe gross profit margin is a better indicator of our financial performance than revenues 
however  higher gas costs may cause customers to conserve  or  in the case of industrial customers  to use alternative energy sources 
higher gas costs may also adversely impact our accounts receivable collections  resulting in higher bad debt expense and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense 

table of contents the effects of weather that is above or below normal are partially offset through weather normalization adjustments in certain of our service areas 
wna allows us to increase the base rate portion of customers bills when weather is warmer than normal and decrease the base rate when weather is colder than normal 
our mid tex division does not have wna 
however  its operations benefit from a rate structure that combines a monthly customer charge with a declining block rate schedule to partially mitigate the impact of warmer than normal weather on revenue 
the combination of the monthly customer charge and the customer billing under the first block of the declining block rate schedule provides for the recovery of a significant portion of our fixed costs for such operations under average weather conditions 
however  this rate structure is not as beneficial during periods where weather is significantly warmer than normal 
operating income utility gross profit increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  total throughput for our utility business was bcf during the current year compared to bcf in the prior year 
the increase in utility gross profit margin primarily reflects the impact of the acquisition of the mid tex division resulting in an increase in utility gross profit margin and total throughput of million and bcf 
the million increase in the gross profit generated from our other utility operations primarily reflects rate increases in our mississippi and west texas divisions that were absent in the prior year coupled with the recognition of a million refund to our customers in our colorado service area in the prior year 
offsetting these increases was a million reduction in gross profit in our louisiana division due to the impact of hurricane katrina 
gross profit margins  particularly in louisiana  were also adversely impacted by weather as adjusted for jurisdictions with weather normalized operations that was five percent warmer than normal and one percent warmer than the prior year period 
additionally  gross profit margin was adversely impacted by the lack of cold weather in patterns sufficient to encourage customers to increase their heat load consumption and lower irrigation throughput in our west texas and colorado kansas divisions 
operating expenses  which include operation and maintenance expense  provision for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes  increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  primarily as a result of the addition of the mid tex division 
excluding the impact of the mid tex division  operating expenses for our other utility operations increased million primarily due to million associated with the effects of hurricane katrina  a million increase in taxes  other than income  a million increase in operation and maintenance expense  including the provision for doubtful accounts  and a million increase in depreciation and amortization 
included in taxes other than income taxes are franchise and state gross receipts taxes which are paid by our customers as a component of their monthly bills 
although these amounts are offset in revenues through customer billings  timing differences between when the expense is incurred and is recovered may impact our net income on a temporary basis 
however  there is no permanent effect on net income 
as a result of the aforementioned factors  our utility segment operating income for the year ended september  increased to million from million for the year ended september  miscellaneous income miscellaneous income increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase was attributable to an increase in interest income earned on higher cash balances during the current year compared with the prior year partially offset by the recognition of a million gain on the sale of a building during the year ended september  interest charges interest charges allocated to the utility segment for the year ended september  increased to million from million for the year ended september  the increase was attributable to the 
table of contents interest expense associated with the issuance of long term debt to finance the acquisition of the mid tex division in october on june   we repaid million in principal on five series of our first mortgage bonds prior to their scheduled maturities 
the early repayment of these bonds resulted in savings of million in interest expense in fiscal natural gas marketing segment our natural gas marketing segment aggregates and purchases gas supply  arranges transportation and or storage logistics and ultimately delivers gas to our customers at competitive prices 
to facilitate this process  we utilize proprietary and customer owned transportation and storage assets to provide the various services our customers request  including furnishing natural gas supplies at fixed and market based prices  contract negotiation and administration  load forecasting  gas storage acquisition and management services  transportation services  peaking sales and balancing services  capacity utilization strategies and gas price hedging through the use of derivative products 
as a result  our revenues arise from the types of commercial transactions we have structured with our customers and include the value we extract by optimizing the storage and transportation capacity we own or control as well as revenues for services we deliver 
to optimize the storage and transportation capacity we own or control  we participate in transactions in which we combine the natural gas commodity and transportation costs to minimize our costs incurred to serve our customers by identifying the lowest cost alternative within the natural gas supplies  transportation and markets to which we have access 
additionally  we engage in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit from the pricing differences that occur over time 
we purchase physical natural gas and then sell financial contracts at favorable prices to lock in gross profit margins 
through the use of transportation and storage services and derivative contracts  we are able to capture gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time 
operating income gross profit margin for our natural gas marketing segment consists primarily of marketing activities  which represent the utilization of proprietary and customer owned transportation and storage assets to provide the various services our customers request  and storage activities  which are derived from the optimization of our managed proprietary and third party storage and transportation assets 
our natural gas marketing segment s gross profit margin was comprised of the following for the year ended september  and year ended september in thousands  except storage balances storage activities realized margin unrealized margin total storage activities marketing activities realized margin unrealized margin total marketing activities gross profit ending storage balance bcf our natural gas marketing segment s gross profit margin was million for the year ended september  compared to gross profit of million for the year ended september  gross 
table of contents profit margin from our natural gas marketing segment for the year ended september  included an unrealized loss of million compared with an unrealized loss of million in the prior year 
natural gas marketing sales volumes were bcf during the year ended september  compared with bcf for the prior year 
excluding intersegment sales volumes  natural gas marketing sales volumes were bcf during the current year compared with bcf in the prior year 
the increase in consolidated natural gas marketing sales volumes primarily was attributable to successfully executed marketing strategies into new market areas 
the contribution to gross profit from our storage activities was a gain of million for the year ended september  compared to a loss of million for the year ended september  the million improvement primarily was attributable to a million increase in the realized storage contribution for the year ended september  compared to the prior year due to more favorable arbitrage spread opportunities during the current year  partially offset by increased storage fees associated with bcf of newly contracted storage capacity during the third quarter of fiscal annual demand charges for this new storage approximate million 
we may further increase the amount of our storage capacity in the future  therefore  the impact of price volatility on our unrealized storage contribution could become more significant in future periods 
a million decrease in the unrealized storage contribution resulted from an unfavorable movement during the year ended september  in the forward indices used to value the storage financial instruments combined with greater physical natural gas storage quantities at september  compared to the prior year also 
our marketing activities contributed million to our gross profit for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  the decrease in the marketing contribution primarily was attributable to million of unrealized marked to market losses associated with basis swaps that were put in place to capture margins in certain volatile market areas 
the increase in unrealized marked to market losses was partially offset by an increase in our realized marketing margins due to focusing our marketing efforts on higher margin customers and successfully entering into new market areas 
operating expenses  which include operation and maintenance expense  provision for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes  increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase in operating expense was attributable primarily to an increase in labor costs due to increased headcount and an increase in regulatory compliance costs 
the increase in gross profit margin  combined with higher operating expenses  resulted in an increase in our natural gas marketing segment operating income to million for the year ended september  compared with operating income of million for the year ended september  pipeline and storage segment our pipeline and storage segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of the atmos pipeline texas division and the nonregulated pipeline and storage operations of atmos pipeline and storage  llc  which were previously included in our other nonutility segment 
the atmos pipeline texas division transports natural gas to our mid tex division and for third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in texas 
we also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking arrangements  blending and sales of inventory on hand 
these operations represent one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gas producing areas of central  northern and eastern texas  extending into or near the major producing areas of the texas gulf coast and the delaware and val verde basins of west texas 
nine basins located in texas are estimated to contain a substantial portion of the nation s remaining onshore natural gas reserves 
this pipeline system provides access to all of these basins 

table of contents aps owns or has an interest in underground storage fields in kentucky and louisiana 
we also use these storage facilities to reduce the need to contract for additional pipeline capacity to meet customer demand during peak periods 
similar to our utility segment  our pipeline and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns  competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas 
natural gas transportation requirements are affected by the winter heating season requirements of our customers 
this generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from october through march of each year and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from april through september of each year 
further  as the atmos pipeline texas division operations provide all of the natural gas for our mid tex division  the results of this segment are highly dependent upon the natural gas requirements of this division 
as a regulated pipeline  the operations of the atmos pipeline texas division may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs 
operating income pipeline and storage gross profit increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  total pipeline transportation volumes were bcf during the year ended september  compared with bcf for the prior year 
excluding intersegment transportation volumes  total pipeline transportation volumes were bcf during the current year 
the increase in pipeline and storage gross profit margin primarily reflects the impact of the acquisition of the atmos pipeline texas division resulting in an increase in pipeline and storage gross profit margin and total transportation volumes of million and bcf 
also contributing to atmos pipeline texas division s results were higher transportation and related services margin due to significant basis differentials at its three major texas hubs 
the million decrease in the gross profit generated by aps primarily reflects a decrease in asset management fees received during fiscal operating expenses increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  due to the addition of million in operating expenses associated with the atmos pipeline texas division 
as the atmos pipeline texas division is a regulated entity  franchise and state gross receipts taxes are paid by our customers  thus  these amounts are offset in revenues through customer billings and have no permanent effect on net income 
included in operating expense was million associated with taxes other than income taxes  of which million was associated with our atmos pipeline texas division 
as a result of the aforementioned factors  our pipeline and storage segment operating income for the year ended september  increased to million from million for the year ended september  interest charges interest charges allocated to this segment for the year ended september  increased to million from million for the year ended september  the increase was attributable to the interest expense associated with the issuance of long term debt to finance the acquisition of the atmos pipeline texas division in october other nonutility segment our other nonutility businesses consist primarily of the operations of atmos energy services  llc  and atmos power systems  inc through aes  we provide natural gas management services to our utility operations  other than the mid tex division 
these services  which began april   include aggregating and purchasing gas supply  arranging transportation and storage logistics and ultimately delivering the gas to our utility service areas at competitive prices 
the revenues of aes represent charges to our utility divisions 
table of contents equal to the costs incurred to provide those services 
through atmos power systems  inc  we construct gas fired electric peaking power generating plants and associated facilities and may enter into agreements to either lease or sell these plants 
operating income for our other nonutility segment primarily reflects the leasing income associated with two sales type lease transactions completed in fiscal and the increase in operating income during the year ended september  reflects the absence of a one time charge of million associated with the wind down of a noncore business during fiscal miscellaneous income for the year ended september  was million compared with million for the year ended september  the million decrease was attributable primarily to the recognition of a million pretax gain on the sale of all remaining limited partnership interests in heritage propane partners  lp during fiscal year ended september  compared with year ended september  utility segment operating income utility gross profit margin increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  total throughput for our utility business was bcf during the year compared to bcf in the prior year 
excluding intercompany throughput  consolidated throughput for our utility business was bcf during the year  compared with bcf in the prior year 
the increase in utility gross profit margin primarily reflects the impact of the acquisition of mississippi valley gas company whose operations are included for the entire first quarter in fiscal year  compared with one month in the first quarter of the prior fiscal year resulting in an increase in utility gross profit margin and total throughput of million and bcf 
utility gross profit margin was also favorably impacted by rate increases received in kansas  texas and mississippi and a million year over year increase in the effect of wna in our wna service areas 
these increases were partially offset by the impact of weather that was six percent warmer than that of the prior year and four percent warmer than normal  resulting in a decrease of approximately million and lower irrigation sales in our west texas division resulting in a decrease of approximately million 
warmer than normal weather particularly impacted our service areas in our louisiana  mid states and west texas divisions 
the decrease in throughput also reflects a decrease in consumption attributable to the impact of conservation and the continued introduction of more efficient gas appliances in our service areas 
finally  our utility gross profit margin for the year ended september  reflects a one time reduction resulting from a regulatory ruling to refund million to our customers in our colorado service area 
operating expenses  which include operation and maintenance expense  provision for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes  increased percent to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  operation and maintenance expense increased  primarily due to the addition of million related to the mvg acquisition in december and higher labor and benefit costs 
taxes other than income taxes increased million  primarily due to additional franchise  payroll and property taxes associated with the mvg assets acquired in december franchise and state gross receipts taxes are paid by our customers as a component of their monthly bills  thus  these amounts are offset in revenues through customer billings and have no effect on net income 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  which primarily reflects mvg depreciation for the full year of fiscal compared with ten months in the prior year 
these increases were partially offset by a million reduction in our provision for doubtful accounts attributable to continued improvement in accounts receivable collections during fiscal as a result of the aforementioned factors  our utility segment operating income for the year ended september  decreased to million from million for the year ended september  
table of contents miscellaneous income expense miscellaneous income for the year ended september  was million  compared with expense of million for the year ended september  the million change was attributable primarily to the absence in of weather insurance amortization totaling million  which was recognized in the prior year due to the termination of our weather insurance policy in the third quarter of fiscal and the recognition of a million gain on the sale of real property during fiscal interest charges interest charges increased percent for the year ended september  to million from million for the year ended september  the increase was attributable primarily to a higher average outstanding debt balance resulting from the financing obtained to fund the acquisition of mvg in december natural gas marketing segment operating income our natural gas marketing segment s gross profit margin was comprised of the following for the years ended september  and year ended september in thousands  except storage balances storage activities realized margin unrealized margin total storage activities marketing activities realized margin unrealized margin total marketing activities gross profit ending storage balance bcf our natural gas marketing segment s gross profit was million for the year ended september  compared to gross profit margin of million for the year ended september  natural gas marketing sales volumes were bcf during the current year compared with bcf for the prior year 
excluding intercompany sales volumes  natural gas marketing sales volumes were bcf during the current year compared with bcf in the prior year 
the decrease in consolidated natural gas marketing sales volumes was primarily due to overall warmer temperatures during the heating season compared with the prior year 
our natural gas marketing gross profit margin for the year ended september  included an unrealized loss on open contracts of million compared with an unrealized gain on open contracts of million in the prior year 
the contribution to gross profit from our storage activities was a loss of million for the year ended september  compared to a loss of million for the year ended september  the million improvement primarily was attributable to a million improvement in the realized storage contribution for the year ended september  compared to the prior year offset by a million decrease in unrealized income associated with our storage portfolio compared to the prior year 
the improvement in the realized storage contribution for the year ended september  primarily was due to 
table of contents our inability during the heating season to withdraw planned volumes from storage to meet our customer requirements caused by operational  contractual and regulatory limitations relating to our storage facilities  which reduced our realized storage contributions during fiscal this situation did not recur in fiscal the decrease in unrealized income in the current year was primarily attributable to a less favorable movement during the year ended september  in the forward indices used to value the storage financial instruments than in the prior year combined with slightly lower physical natural gas storage quantities at september  compared to the prior year 
our marketing activities contributed million to our gross profit margin for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  the increase in the marketing contribution primarily was attributable to our continued efforts to amend contracts with third parties to transfer risk to our customers and to provide higher gross profit margins and improved position management during the current year 
operating expenses  which include operation and maintenance expense  provision for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes  increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase in operating expense was attributable primarily to higher labor and benefit costs resulting from the improvement in earnings for the fiscal year and an increase in temporary and permanent personnel due to systems and process improvements in the marketing segment 
the improved gross profit margin resulted in an increase in our natural gas marketing segment operating income to million for the year ended september  compared with operating income of million for the year ended september  miscellaneous income miscellaneous income for the year ended september  was million  compared with income of million for the year ended september  the million decrease was attributable primarily to lower interest income earned on cash held on deposit in margin accounts due to favorable valuations on our financial derivatives  which reduced the need to deposit cash into margin accounts 
pipeline and storage segment operating income our pipeline and storage operating income decreased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the decrease in our pipeline and storage operating income was primarily attributable to a decrease in demand charges recognized by atmos pipeline and storage  llc for storage services provided during the year ended september  compared to the prior year and lower transported volumes of approximately bcf by aps due to overall warmer weather during the winter heating season 
the decrease was also attributable to a million decrease in monthly facilities fees charged by trans louisiana gas pipeline  inc as a result of a settlement reached with the louisiana public service commission in october our pipeline and storage operating income for the year ended september  also included an unrealized loss on open contracts of million compared with no unrealized gain our loss in the prior year as aps started to hedge its storage inventory during the fourth quarter of other nonutility segment operating income our other nonutility operating income decreased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the decrease in our other nonutility operating income was attributable primarily to a one time charge of million associated with the wind down of a noncore business 

table of contents miscellaneous income miscellaneous income for the year ended september  was million  compared with income of million for the year ended september  the million increase was attributable primarily to a million pretax gain associated with the sale in january of our general and limited partnership interests in usp and the sale in june of the remaining limited partnership units in heritage propane partners  lp formerly owned by usp 
this increase was offset partially by lower equity earnings from our investment in usp resulting from the sale and the absence in of a million gain recorded in associated with a sales type lease of a distributed electric generation plant 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital and liquidity for capital expenditure and other cash needs are provided from internally generated funds  borrowings under our credit facilities and commercial paper program and funds raised from the public debt and equity capital markets 
we believe that these sources of funds will provide the necessary working capital and liquidity for capital expenditures and other cash needs for fiscal however  during fiscal  we anticipate that higher natural gas prices primarily resulting from the recent natural disasters will increase our need to utilize our short term credit facilities to temporarily finance the purchase of natural gas to fulfill our contractual obligations 
these facilities are described in greater detail below and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
capitalization the following presents our capitalization as of september  and september in thousands  except percentages short term debt long term debt shareholders equity total capitalization  including short term debt total debt as a percentage of total capitalization  including short term debt  was percent and percent at september  and the increase in the debt to capitalization ratio was attributable to the issuance of billion in senior unsecured long term debt  partially offset by the issuance of million shares of our common stock in october to partially finance the txu gas acquisition 
our ratio of total debt to capitalization is typically greater during the winter heating season as we make additional short term borrowings to fund natural gas purchases and meet our working capital requirements 
within three to five years from the closing of the txu gas acquisition  we intend to reduce our capitalization ratio to a target range of to percent through cash flow generated from operations  continued issuance of new common stock under our direct stock purchase plan and retirement savings plan  access to the equity capital markets and reduced annual maintenance and capital expenditures 
cash flows our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors  some of which we cannot control 
these include regulatory changes  the price for our products and services  the demand for such products and services  margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices  operational risks and other factors 

table of contents cash flows from operating activities year over year changes in our operating cash flows are attributable primarily to working capital changes within our utility segment resulting from the impact of weather  the price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections  payments for natural gas purchases and deferred gas cost recoveries 
for the year ended september   we generated operating cash flow of million compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal the significant factors impacting our operating cash flow for the last three fiscal years are summarized below 
year ended september  fiscal operating cash flows reflect the effects of a million increase in net income and effective working capital management partially offset by higher natural gas prices 
working capital management efforts  which affected the timing of payments for accounts payable and other accrued liabilities  favorably affected operating cash flow by million 
however  these efforts were partially offset by reduced cash flow generated from accounts receivable changes by million  primarily attributable to higher natural gas prices  and an increase in our natural gas inventories attributable to a percent year over year increase in natural gas prices coupled with increased natural gas inventory levels  which reduced operating cash flow by million 
operating cash flow was also adversely impacted by unfavorable movements in the indices used to value our natural gas marketing segment risk management assets and liabilities  which resulted in a net liability for the segment 
accordingly  under the terms of the associated derivative contracts  we were required to deposit million into a margin account 
year ended september  fiscal operating cash flows were favorably impacted by several items 
improved customer collections during fiscal  compared with the prior year  resulted in a million increase in operating cash flow 
further  cash used for natural gas inventories decreased by million compared with the prior year 
the decrease was attributable to lower injections of natural gas into storage  partially offset by higher prices 
the reduction in the lag between the time period when we purchase our natural gas and the period in which we can include this cost in our gas rates improved operating cash flow by million 
changes in cash held on deposit in margin accounts resulted in an increase in operating cash flow of million 
this account represents deposits recorded to collateralize certain of our financial derivatives purchased in support of our natural gas marketing activities 
the favorable change was attributable to the fact that the fair value of financial instruments held by aem represented a net asset position at september   which eliminated the need to place cash in margin accounts 
finally  other working capital and other changes improved operating cash flow by million 
these changes primarily related to various increases in deferred credits and other liabilities  other current liabilities and income taxes payable partially offset by lower deferred income tax expense as compared with the prior year 
year ended september  fiscal operating cash flow was adversely impacted by a million increase in accounts receivable due to higher revenues and the timing of customer account collections 
the increase in revenues was attributable to a percent increase in consolidated utility throughput as a result of the impact of our mvg acquisition 
operating cash flow was also adversely impacted by a significant increase in natural gas prices 
these increases resulted in a million increase in gas stored underground and a million increase in deferred gas costs 
finally  operating cash flow reflects the impact of the funding of our pension plan in june  which included a million cash payment 
cash flows from investing activities during the last three years  a substantial portion of our cash resources was used to fund acquisitions  our ongoing construction program to provide natural gas services to our customer base  enhance the integrity of our pipelines and improvements to information systems 

table of contents for the year ended september   we incurred million for capital expenditures compared with million for the year ended september  and million for the year ended september  capital expenditures for the year ended september  include approximately million for the atmos energy mid tex division and million for the atmos pipeline texas division 
our cash used for investing activities for the year ended september  reflects the billion cash paid for the txu gas acquisition including related transaction costs and expenses 
cash flow from investing activities for the year ended september  reflect the receipt of million from the sale of our limited and general partnership interests in usp and heritage propane partners  lp and from the sale of a building 
cash flows from financing activities for the year ended september   our financing activities provided billion in cash compared with million and million provided for the years ended september  and our significant financing activities for the years ended september   and are summarized as follows in october  we sold million common shares  including the underwriters exercise of their overallotment option of million shares  under a new registration statement declared effective in september  generating net proceeds of million 
additionally  we issued senior unsecured debt under the registration statement consisting of million of senior notes due  million of senior notes due  million of senior notes due and million of floating rate senior notes due the floating rate notes bear interest at a rate equal to the three month libor rate plus percent per year 
the net proceeds received from the sale of these senior notes were billion 
the net proceeds from these issuances  combined with the net proceeds from our july offering were used to repay the approximately billion in outstanding commercial paper backstopped by a senior unsecured revolving credit agreement  which we entered into on september  for bridge financing for the txu gas acquisition 
during the year ended september  we borrowed a net million under our short term facilities whereas during the year ended september  and  we repaid a net million and million under our short term facilities 
borrowings under our short term facilities during fiscal reflect the impact of seasonal natural gas purchases and the effect of higher natural gas prices than in prior years 
prior year repayments under our short term facilities reflected the timing of cash receipts which enabled us to reduce our short term debt 
we repaid million of long term debt during the year ended september  compared with million during the year ended september  and million during the year ended september  fiscal payments reflected the repayment of million of our first mortgage bonds 
in connection with this repayment we paid a million make whole premium in accordance with the terms of the agreements and accrued interest of approximately million 
in accordance with regulatory requirements  the premium has been deferred and will be recognized over the remaining original lives of the first mortgage bonds that were repaid 
the early repayment of these bonds resulted in interest savings of million in fiscal and should result in interest savings of million in fiscal during the year ended september  we paid million in cash dividends compared with dividend payments of million and million for the years ended september  and the increase in dividends paid over the prior year reflects the million increase in the number of common shares outstanding and an increase in the dividend rate from per share during the year ended september  to per share during the year ended september

the initial weighted average effective interest rate on these notes was percent 
the net proceeds from the sale of these senior notes were billion 
the net proceeds from the october common stock and senior notes offerings  combined with the net proceeds from our july offering were used to pay off the billion in outstanding commercial paper backstopped by a senior unsecured revolving credit agreement  which we entered into on september  for bridge financing for the txu gas acquisition 
after issuing the debt and equity in october we have approximately million of availability remaining under this registration statement 

table of contents credit facilities we maintain both committed and uncommitted credit facilities 
borrowings under our uncommitted credit facilities are made on a when and as needed basis at the discretion of the bank 
our credit capacity and the amount of unused borrowing capacity are affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business and our short term borrowing requirements  which are typically highest during colder winter months 
our working capital needs can vary significantly due to changes in the price of natural gas charged by suppliers and the increased gas supplies required to meet customers needs during periods of cold weather 
our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures have increased substantially as a result of the acquisition of the natural gas distribution and pipeline operations of txu gas 
on october   we replaced our million credit facility with a new million committed credit facility that serves as a backup liquidity facility for our commercial paper program 
we believe this facility  combined with our operating cash flow will be sufficient to fund these increased working capital needs 
on march   aem amended and extended its uncommitted demand working capital credit facility to march  at september   there was million outstanding under our commercial paper program and million outstanding under our bank credit facilities 
these facilities are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in anticipation of increased short term liquidity needs due to the recent increases in natural gas prices  we worked with our regulators  who approved an increase in the amounts available to our utility operations under short term credit facilities to million  consisting of a new million year revolving credit facility to replace our existing million day credit facility that expired in october  a new million day revolving credit facility  a new million uncommitted facility and our existing million uncommitted and million committed credit facilities 
additionally  we are working with our lenders to obtain up to an additional million of capacity under our uncommitted demand working capital credit facility to provide additional short term liquidity to support our natural gas marketing operations 
credit ratings our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain short term and long term financing  in addition to the cost of such financing 
in determining our credit ratings  the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors  including debt to total capitalization  operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt  operating cash flow coverage of interest and pension liabilities and funding status 
in addition  the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time  the quality of our management and business strategy  the risks associated with our utility and nonutility businesses and the regulatory structures that govern our rates in the states where we operate

the highest investment grade credit rating for s p is aaa  moody s is aaa and fitch is aaa 
the lowest investment grade credit rating for s p is bbb  moody s is baa and fitch is bbb 
our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies  and each rating should be evaluated independent of any other rating 
there can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered  or withdrawn entirely  by a rating agency if  in its judgment  circumstances so warrant 

table of contents debt covenants we are required by the financial covenants in both of our revolving credit facilities to maintain  at the end of each fiscal quarter  a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of no greater than percent

our two public debt indentures relating to our senior notes and debentures  as well as our two revolving credit agreements  each contain a default provision that is triggered if outstanding indebtedness arising out of any other credit agreements in amounts ranging from in excess of million to in excess of million becomes due by acceleration or is not paid at maturity 
in addition  aem s credit agreement contains a cross default provision whereby aem would be in default if it defaults on other indebtedness  as defined  by at least thousand in the aggregate 
additionally  this agreement contains a provision that would limit the amount of credit available if atmos were downgraded below an s p rating of bbb and a moody s rating of baa except as described above  we have no triggering events in our debt instruments that are tied to changes in specified credit ratings or stock price  nor have we entered into any transactions that would require us to issue equity based on our credit rating or other triggering events

aem has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural gas under contracts indexed to the forward nymex strip or fixed price contracts 
at september   aem was committed to purchase bcf within one year  bcf between one to three years and bcf after three years under indexed contracts 
aem was committed to purchase bcf within one year and bcf within one to three years under fixed price contracts with prices ranging from to 
with the exception of our mid tex division  our utility segment maintains supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year 
commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices 
commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of the individual contract 
our mid tex division maintains long term supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market prices 
the estimated commitments under these contract terms as of september  are reflected in the table above 
in january  we signed a letter of intent with a third party to jointly construct  own and operate a mile large diameter natural gas pipeline in the northern portion of the dallas fort worth metroplex 
under terms of the letter of intent  the third party will provide the initial capital to build the pipeline and we expect to contribute million within two years of signing a definitive agreement 
we expect to execute 
table of contents this agreement during the first quarter of fiscal and the pipeline is currently expected to be placed into service in fiscal additionally  during the third quarter of  we entered into two agreements with third parties to transport natural gas through our texas intrastate pipeline system beginning in fiscal to handle the increased volumes for these projects  we will install compression equipment and other pipeline infrastructure 
we expect to spend approximately million in for these projects 
risk management activities we conduct risk management activities through both our utility and natural gas marketing segments 
in our utility segment  we use a combination of storage  fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to partially insulate us and our customers against gas price volatility during the winter heating season 
in our natural gas marketing segment  we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial derivatives  including futures  over the counter and exchange traded options and swap contracts with counterparties 
finally  during fiscal  we entered into four treasury lock agreements to fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost of financing associated with the anticipated issuance of million of long term debt 
these treasury lock agreements were settled in october with a net million payment to the counterparties 
approximately million of the million obligation will be recognized as a component of interest expense over a five year period from the date of settlement  and the remaining amount  approximately million  will be recognized as a component of interest expense over a ten year period from the date of settlement 
our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we record our derivatives as a component of risk management assets and liabilities  which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying derivative 
substantially all of our derivative financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices 
the following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our utility and natural gas marketing derivative contract activities for the year ended september  in thousands natural gas utility marketing fair value of contracts at september  contracts realized settled fair value of new contracts other changes in value fair value of contracts at september  the fair value of our utility and natural gas marketing derivative contracts at september   is segregated below by time period and fair value source

table of contents storage and hedging outlook aem participates in transactions in which it seeks to find and profit from pricing differences that occur over time 
aem purchases physical natural gas and then sells financial contracts at favorable prices to lock in gross profit margins 
aem is able to capture gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time 
natural gas inventory is marked to market monthly using the iferc price at the end of each month with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change 
derivatives associated with our natural gas inventory  which are designated as fair value hedges  are marked to market each month based upon the nymex price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change 
the changes in the difference between the indices used to mark to market our physical inventory iferc and the related fair value hedge nymex is reported as a component of revenue and can result in volatility in our reported net income 
over time  gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses on the fair value hedges  therefore  the economic gross profit aem captured in the original transaction remains essentially unchanged 
aem continually manages its positions to enhance the future economic profit it captured in the original transaction 
therefore  aem may change its scheduled injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions or adjust the amount of storage capacity it holds on a discretionary basis in an effort to achieve this objective 
aem monitors the impacts of these profit optimization efforts by estimating the forecasted gross profit margin that it captured through the purchase and sale of physical natural gas and the associated financial derivatives 
the forecasted gross profit margin  less the effect of unrealized gains or losses recognized in the financial statements  provides a measure of the net increase or decrease in the gross profit margin that could occur in future periods if aem s optimization efforts are fully successful 
as of september   based upon aem s derivatives position and inventory withdrawal schedule  the forecasted gross profit margin was approximately million 
approximately million of net unrealized losses were recorded in the financial statements as of september  therefore  the projected increase in future gross profit margin is approximately million 
the forecasted gross profit margin calculation is based upon planned injection and withdrawal schedules  and the realization of the forecasted gross profit margin is contingent upon the execution of this plan  weather and other execution factors 
since aem actively manages and optimizes its portfolio to enhance the future profitability of its storage position  it may change its scheduled injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions 
therefore  we cannot assure that the forecasted gross profit margin or the projected increase in future gross profit margin calculated as of september  will be fully realized in the future or in what time period 
further  if we experience operational or other issues which limit our ability to optimally manage our stored gas positions  permanent impacts on earnings may result 
pension and postretirement benefits obligations net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs for the fiscal year ended september   our total net periodic pension and other benefits costs was million  compared with million and million for the years ended september  and a portion of these costs is capitalized into our utility rate base  as these costs are recoverable through our gas utility rates 
costs that are not capitalized are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense 
the increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits cost during fiscal compared with the prior year primarily reflects an increase in our service cost associated with the increase in the number of employees covered by our plans due to the txu gas acquisition 
although we did not assume the existing employee benefit liabilities or plans of txu gas  for purposes of determining our annual pension cost we agreed to give the transitioned employees credit for years of txu gas service under our pension plan 
with respect to our postretirement medical plan  we received a credit of million against the purchase price to permit us to provide partial past service credits for retiree medical benefits under our retiree medical plan 
the 
table of contents million credit approximates the actuarially determined present value of the accumulated benefits related to the past service of the transferred employees on the acquisition date 
in addition to the increased number of employees covered by the plans  we changed the assumptions used to determine our fiscal benefit costs  which resulted in an increase in our net periodic pension and postretirement costs 
we increased the discount rate by basis points and we reduced our expected return on our pension plan assets by basis points 
these assumption changes decreased the service cost and interest cost and reduced the expected return components of our pension and postretirement benefits costs 
the decrease in total net periodic pension and other benefits cost during fiscal compared with fiscal primarily reflects the impact of adopting the provisions of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act  beginning with the second quarter of  which reduced our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and our net postretirement benefit obligation costs by million 
the total income statement impact was million as a portion of this benefit was capitalized 
further  the expected return on plan assets  which reduces our net pension and postretirement costs  increased as compared with the prior year primarily due to an increase in total assets attributable to the full year effect of the contributions we made to the atmos pension account plan in fiscal and the inclusion of the mvg pension plan assets during fiscal partially offset by a basis point decrease in the expected return on plan asset assumption used to determine fiscal net periodic pension cost 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the service cost and the recognized actuarial loss attributable to a basis point decrease in the discount rate used to determine our fiscal net periodic pension and other benefits costs compared with the discount rate used to determine our fiscal costs  resulting from a decrease in interest rates in the period leading up to our june measurement date 
pension and postretirement plan funding generally  our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount in accordance with the requirements of the employee retirement income security act of however  additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary 
contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future 
during fiscal  we voluntarily contributed million to the atmos energy corporation master retirement trust the trust to maintain the level of funding we desire relative to our accumulated benefit obligation 
we elected to contribute to the trust because declining high yield corporate bond yields in the period leading up to our june  measurement date resulted in an increase in the present value of our plan liabilities 
in june  we contributed to the trust for the benefit of the atmos energy corporation pension account plan million in cash and  shares of atmos restricted common stock with the then market value of million 
we did not contribute to our pension plans during fiscal we contributed million  million and million to our postretirement benefits plans for the years ended september   and the contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by our regulators 
outlook for fiscal as noted above  high grade corporate bond yields were decreasing in the period leading up to our june  measurement date 
therefore  we reduced the discount rate for determining our fiscal pension and benefit costs by basis points to percent 
additionally  we reduced the expected return on our pension plan assets by basis points to percent 
the effect of these assumption changes  coupled with the effects of updating our annual valuation will result in an increase in our net pension and postretirement costs of approximately million 

table of contents we are not required to make a minimum funding contribution to our pension plans during fiscal nor  at this time  do we intend to make voluntary contributions during however  we anticipate contributing approximately million to our postretirement medical plans during fiscal the projected pension liability  future funding requirements and the amount of pension expense or income recognized for the plan are subject to change  depending upon the actuarial value of plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent actuarial calculation date 
these amounts are impacted by actual investment returns  changes in interest rates and changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the plan 
recent accounting developments recent accounting developments and their impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates 
commodity price risk is the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity 
interest rate risk results from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing and liquidity for our business 
we conduct risk management activities through both our utility and natural gas marketing segments 
in our utility segment  we use a combination of storage  fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to partially insulate us and our customers against gas price volatility during the winter heating season 
in our natural gas marketing segment  we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial derivatives including futures  over the counter and exchange traded options and swap contracts with counterparties 
our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of our issuance of short term commercial paper  the issuance of floating rate debt in october and our other short term borrowings 
commodity price risk utility segment we purchase natural gas for our utility operations 
substantially all of the cost of gas purchased for utility operations is recovered from our customers through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms 
however  our utility operations have commodity price risk exposure to fluctuations in spot natural gas prices related to purchases for sales to our non regulated energy services customers at fixed prices 
for our utility segment  we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate commodity price risk 
for purposes of this analysis  we estimate commodity price risk by applying a hypothetical percent increase in the portion of our gas cost related to fixed price non regulated sales 
based on these projected non regulated gas sales  a hypothetical percent increase in fixed prices based upon the september  three month market strip would increase our purchased gas cost by approximately million in fiscal natural gas marketing and pipeline and storage segments our natural gas marketing segment is also exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas 
for our natural gas marketing segment  we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate commodity price risk 
for purposes of this analysis  we estimate commodity price risk by applying a change in the forward nymex price to our net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at the end of each period 
because aeh did not have any net open positions including existing storage and related financial contracts at september   there would be no impact on our consolidated net income due to fluctuations in the forward nymex price 

table of contents however  changes in the difference between the indices used to mark to market our physical inventory iferc and the related fair value hedge nymex can result in volatility in our reported net income  however  over time  gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses on the fair value hedges 
based upon our storage position at september  of bcf  a change in the difference between the iferc and nymex indices could impact our reported net income by approximately million 
interest rate risk our earnings are exposed to changes in short term interest rates associated with our short term commercial paper program  other short term borrowings and floating rate debt 
we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our short term interest rate risk 
for purposes of this analysis  we estimate our short term interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average of a one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our short term borrowings 
had interest rates associated with our short term borrowings outstanding during fiscal increased by an average of one percent  our interest expense would have increased by approximately million during we also assess market risk for our fixed rate  long term obligations 
we estimate market risk for our fixed rate  long term obligations as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percent decrease in interest rates associated with these debt instruments 
fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis 
assuming this one percent hypothetical decrease  the fair value of our fixed rate  long term obligations outstanding as of september  would have increased by approximately million 
as of september   we were not engaged in any other activities which would cause exposure to the risk of material earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in interest rates or market commodity prices
