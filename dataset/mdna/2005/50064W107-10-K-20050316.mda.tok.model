item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations liquidity and capital resources 
we believe that our existing cash and investment securities and anticipated cash flow from our existing collaboration with roche will be sufficient to support our current operating plan into the second half of  although we may choose to obtain additional financing from time to time 
we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors  including the following our ability to establish any new collaborations  our rights and obligations under any new collaboration agreements and our ability to generate revenues under any new collaborations  the progress  number and costs of our research programs  the extent to which clinical and other development activities are funded by our current collaborators  roche and the nci  the progress  success and costs of preclinical testing and clinical trials of our drug candidates  
table of contents our ability to maintain or extend our existing collaborations with roche and the nci  the costs and timing of obtaining  enforcing and defending patent and other intellectual property rights  any need to obtain licenses to additional patents or other intellectual property in order to use  import  manufacture  market or sell our product candidates  our ability to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates and the costs and timing of doing so  any need to expand our manufacturing capabilities  any need to build commercial infrastructure to market our products  and expenses associated with any possible future litigation 
if our current collaborations are unsuccessful or if conflicts develop with our collaborators  our research and development efforts could be delayed  curtailed or terminated  our revenues could significantly decrease and our operations may be adversely affected 
we have a corporate research and commercialization collaboration with roche in the field of epothilones 
we also have collaborations with  or have licenses to technology and compounds from  several research groups  including sloan kettering in the field of epothilones  the nci in the field of geldanamycin analogs and stanford university in the field of polyketide technology 
the agreements permit our collaborators or licensors to terminate the agreements under certain circumstances 
we may not be able to maintain or extend these collaborations or license agreements on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we do not maintain  extend or replace our corporate collaboration with roche  our research and development efforts could be delayed  our revenues would significantly decrease and our operations could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to maintain our research collaborations or if our license agreements are terminated  our research and development efforts could be delayed  curtailed or terminated or we could lose our rights to use the licensed technology and compounds 
we do not control the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators devote to our programs or potential products  nor the scope  content and timing of the efforts that they conduct or permit under the collaborations 
as a result  we do not know if our collaborators will dedicate sufficient resources or if the development or commercialization efforts by our corporate partners will be successful 
we also do not know if the development or commercialization efforts by our collaborators will be the same as those we would choose to devote if we solely controlled the development and commercialization of our programs and product candidates 
in particular  in our collaboration with roche  we do not control the amount and timing of resources that roche devotes to the epothilone program beyond limited funding for certain kosan activities specified under the contract  and we do not control the scope  content and timing of the preclinical studies  clinical trials and other development efforts that roche conducts or permits under the program 
in our collaboration with the nci  we do not control the selection  conduct  timing and resources provided to clinical trials of geldanamycin analogs sponsored by the nci 
for these reasons  we may choose to undertake product development efforts that are within the scope of our collaborations at our own expense 
we also do not know whether our current collaborative partners or future collaborative partners  if any  might pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products either on their own or in collaboration with others  including our competitors  as a means for developing treatments for the diseases targeted by collaborative arrangements with us 
in addition  business combinations or significant changes in a collaborator s business strategy may adversely affect a collaborator s willingness or ability to continue the collaboration with us 
failure by our corporate partners to develop or commercialize a compound or product for which they have rights from us could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  if roche does not successfully develop and commercialize a product from our epothilone program  we may not receive any future milestone payments and will not receive any royalties under our collaboration with roche 

table of contents kosan biosciences if our collaborators fail to conduct the collaborative activities successfully and in a timely manner or if they or our licensors breach or terminate their agreements with us  the development or commercialization of the affected product candidates  technology or research program could be delayed or terminated 
if any of our existing collaboration agreements are terminated  we may be required to seek new collaborators or to undertake product development and commercialization at our own expense 
this may limit the number of product candidates we will be able to develop and commercialize  significantly increase our capital requirements and reduce the likelihood of successful product introduction 
disputes might also arise with collaborators or licensors concerning rights to particular compounds or technologies 
if we are unable to resolve these disputes in our favor  we could lose our rights to use those compounds or technologies 
if we fail to enter into new collaborative agreements in the future  our business and operations would be negatively impacted 
our strategy depends upon the formation and sustainability of multiple collaborative arrangements and license agreements with third parties 
we expect to rely on these arrangements for not only financial resources  but also for expertise that we expect to need in the future relating to clinical trials  manufacturing  sales and marketing  and for license and technology rights 
although we have established collaborative arrangements and various license agreements  we do not know if we will be able to establish additional arrangements on favorable terms  or whether current or any future collaborative arrangements will ultimately be successful 
there have been  and may continue to be  a significant number of business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted  and may continue to result  in a reduced number of potential future corporate collaborators  which may limit our ability to find partners who will work with us in developing and commercializing our drug candidates 
if we do not enter into new collaborative agreements  we may be required to curtail  suspend or terminate research and development programs and therefore our ability to generate revenues from these programs will be adversely affected 
our ability to start new research and development programs may also be materially harmed 
our potential products are in an early stage of development  and substantial additional effort and expense will be necessary for development 
our drug candidates are in early stages of research and development 
we may not be able to develop products that prove to be safe and effective  meet applicable regulatory standards  are capable of being manufactured at reasonable costs or can be marketed successfully 
all of the potential products that we are currently developing will require significant development and investment  including extensive preclinical and clinical testing  before we can submit any application for regulatory approval 
our products must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy before they can be approved by the fda and international regulatory authorities for commercial use 
we will need to conduct significant additional research  preclinical testing and clinical trials before we can determine if our products are sufficiently safe and effective to file with the fda and other regulatory agencies for product approval 
clinical trials are expensive  and therefore  significant amounts of money will need to be spent testing our products 
in addition  significant time and investment will be required to try to develop manufacturing processes for our products so that they are economical to manufacture on a commercial scale and satisfactory to the fda and other governmental authorities 
the progress and results of our animal and human testing are highly uncertain 
we must provide the fda and foreign regulatory authorities with clinical data that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our products before they can be approved for commercial sale 
as a result  commercialization of our product candidates depends upon successful completion of preclinical and clinical trials 
preclinical testing and clinical 
table of contents development are long  expensive and uncertain processes 
it may take us a number of years to complete our testing  and failure can occur at any stage of testing 
for example  in november  we discontinued a phase ii clinical study of kos in non small cell lung cancer because the study did not meet the primary objective of tumor response in the first stage of a two stage clinical trial  and in june  we discontinued a phase ii clinical study of kos in colorectal cancer due to unanticipated cumulative drug toxicities in patients who had previously been treated with the cancer treatment oxaliplatin 
we could experience similar failures in other current or future clinical testing of our product candidates 
success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful  and interim results of trials do not necessarily predict final results 
a number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry  including kosan  have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after promising results in earlier trials 
also  preclinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways  which could delay  limit or prevent further testing or regulatory approval 
we do not know whether clinical trials of our product candidates including ongoing and anticipated clinical trials of kos  kos  aag  kos  kos or other product candidates will begin on time or whether any of our clinical trials will be completed on schedule  or at all 
negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause a clinical trial to be suspended  repeated or terminated 
certain of the clinical trials of our product candidates are designed to include two stages  with the decision whether to proceed to the second stage dependent on results obtained in the first stage 
failure to achieve predetermined response rates as defined in the protocol may result in the decision not to proceed into the second stage of the related trial 
we have four product candidates in human clinical trials for the treatment of cancer  kos  kos  kos and kos anticancer drugs generally have a narrow therapeutic window between efficacy and toxicity 
if unacceptable toxicity is observed in a clinical trial  the trial may be terminated at an early stage 
for example  in june  we discontinued a phase ii clinical study of kos in colorectal cancer due to unanticipated cumulative drug toxicities in patients who had previously been treated with the cancer treatment oxaliplatin 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more 
the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of the drug candidate 
our clinical trials including ongoing and anticipated clinical trials of kos  kos  aag  kos  kos or other product candidates may be suspended at any time  if we  the fda  or other regulatory authorities believe the patients participating in our studies are exposed to unacceptable health risks 
our ability to commence or timely complete clinical trials may be adversely affected by many factors  including ineffectiveness of the study compound  or perceptions by physicians that the compound is not effective for a particular indication  inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of compound for use in clinical trials  a failure to obtain approval from the fda  other regulatory authorities or an investigational site s investigational review board to conduct a clinical trial  inability to reach agreement with a sufficient number of investigational sites to conduct a study  slower than expected rate of patient recruitment or inability to recruit a sufficient number of patients  adverse medical events or the death of patients during a clinical trial  even if caused by the advanced status of their disease or medical problems that are not related to our product candidates  inconclusive or negative results from the clinical trial  competing clinical trials in the same or similar indication  
table of contents kosan biosciences third party clinical investigators failing to perform our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or consistent with a clinical trial protocol  and other third party organizations not performing data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner  and a decision by the fda or other governmental authorities to require suspension of a clinical study 
our product development costs will increase if we have delays in testing or approvals or if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than planned 
if the delays are significant  our financial results and the commercial prospects for our products will be harmed  and our ability to become profitable will be adversely affected 
if any clinical trials of our product candidates including ongoing and anticipated clinical trials of kos  kos  aag  kos  kos or other product candidates are not successful  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be harmed 
if we are not able to obtain required regulatory approvals  we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates  and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired 
our product candidates and the activities associated with their development  manufacture and commercialization are subject to comprehensive regulation by the fda and other regulatory agencies in the united states  and by comparable authorities in other countries 
our products may not be commercialized unless and until our collaborators or we obtain regulatory approval from the fda or foreign governmental authorities to do so 
the process of obtaining regulatory approvals is expensive  often takes many years  if approval is obtained at all  and can vary substantially based upon the type  complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved 
we have not received regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates in any jurisdiction and  although our personnel have experience from working at other companies  we as a company have no experience in preparing and filing the applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals to commercialize our products 
this lack of experience may impede our ability to obtain fda or other foreign regulatory approvals to commercialize our products in a timely manner  if at all 
changes in the regulatory approval policy during the development period  changes in or the enactment of additional regulations or statutes  or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application  may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application 
furthermore  the approval procedure and the time required to obtain approval varies among countries and can involve additional testing beyond that required by the fda 
approval by one regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions 
the fda and other regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical  clinical or other studies or modifications to the manufacturing processes or facilities or quality control procedures for our products 
any clinical trial may fail to produce results satisfactory to the fda or other regulatory authorities 
preclinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
furthermore  even if we file an application with the fda or other regulatory authorities for marketing approval of a product candidate  it may not result in marketing approval from the fda or other regulatory authorities 
we do not know whether clinical trials for our product candidates including ongoing and anticipated clinical trials of kos  kos  aag  kos  kos or other product candidates will demonstrate safety and efficacy sufficient to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals or will result in marketable products 
our failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our products under development will prevent receipt of fda and foreign approvals and  ultimately  commercialization of our products 

table of contents we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials  and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily 
we do not have the ability to independently conduct clinical trials for our products  and we rely on third parties such as contract research organizations  medical institutions and clinical investigators to perform this function 
we also rely on roche to conduct certain clinical trials for kos and potentially kos and the nci to conduct certain clinical trials for aag and kos we may rely on future collaborators to conduct clinical trials for our product candidates 
if any of these third parties do not successfully carry out their obligations or meet expected deadlines  clinical trials may be extended  delayed or terminated  and our product candidates may not receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized 
even if any of our product candidates receives regulatory approval  we may still face significant development and regulatory difficulties 
even if the fda or other regulatory authorities approves a product candidate  the approval may impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses  conditions for use  labeling  advertising  promotion  marketing and or production of such product  and may impose ongoing requirements for post approval studies  including additional research and development and clinical trials 
in addition  regulatory agencies subject a product  its manufacturer and the manufacturer s facilities to continual review and periodic inspections 
if a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product  including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency  or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured  a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product  our collaborators or us  including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market 
if any of our approved products  our collaborators or we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  a regulatory authority may take various actions  including issuing warning letters  imposing civil or criminal penalties  suspending regulatory approval  refusing to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or our collaborators  imposing restrictions on operations  including costly new manufacturing requirements  or seizing or detaining products or requiring a product recall 
manufacturing difficulties could delay or preclude commercialization of our products and substantially increase our expenses 
currently  we are the sole manufacturer of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for kos  we rely on a contract manufacturer for the active pharmaceutical ingredient for kos and we use a single outside contractor to formulate drug product for kos and kos we currently maintain limited inventories of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for kos and kos at our facilities in hayward  california 
we currently maintain limited inventories of formulated drug product for kos and kos at our facilities in hayward  california and at the facilities of an outside contractor 
limited inventories of formulated drug product for kos are also maintained by roche 
in our geldanamycin program  we currently use a single manufacturer to make the active pharmaceutical ingredients for aag including kos and kos we formulate drug product for aag  kos and kos both at our own facility and through a contract manufacturer 
we currently maintain a limited inventory of aag  
table of contents kosan biosciences kos and kos at our facilities in hayward  california and at the facilities of an outside contractor 
the nci is not obligated to maintain an inventory of either the active pharmaceutical ingredient or formulated drug product for aag or kos if any of our or our contract manufacturers manufacturing or inventory facilities encounter delays  are destroyed or otherwise become unavailable to us  then the clinical development of our product candidates including kos  kos  aag  kos and kos or submissions for their regulatory approval  and therefore commercialization  could be delayed or precluded 
adverse effects would be particularly acute if problems arise with our sole sourcing or inventory relationships 
because our manufacturing processes and those of our contractors are complex and subject to a lengthy regulatory approval process  alternative qualified production capacity may not be available on a timely basis or at all 
a number of factors could cause prolonged interruptions in the manufacturing and supply of our products  including the inability of a supplier to provide raw materials or key intermediates used for manufacture of our products  equipment malfunctions or failures  the inability to manufacture in accordance with current good manufacturing practices  the delay of product shipments due to us custom regulations or third party carriers used to transport our products  and damage to our products while they are in transit  changes in fda or other regulatory authority requirements or standards that require modifications to the manufacturing processes or facilities used in the production of our products  action by the fda or other regulatory authorities to suspend production of one or more of our products  or difficulties in scaling up production of our products for large clinical trials or commercial supply 
while our manufacturing personnel have extensive experience from working at other companies  we as a company have no experience manufacturing products for commercial sale 
we may encounter difficulties in attempting to scale up our manufacturing processes and facilities 
we may not be able to achieve such scale up in a timely manner or at a commercially reasonable cost  if at all 
in addition  our facilities in hayward  california are located within the san francisco bay area  an area that is subject periodically to earthquakes 
our access to any key intermediates  active pharmaceutical ingredient or formulated drug product for our product candidates sourced or inventoried solely through our facilities in hayward may be subject to interruption in the event of an earthquake 
as discussed above  we rely upon outside contractors to manufacture and supply to us key intermediates  active pharmaceutical ingredients and formulated drug product for our product candidates 
our dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates and components thereof may adversely affect our ability to continue in a timely manner clinical development of our product candidates and may adversely affect any future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any products that we may develop on a timely and competitive basis 
dependence on contract manufacturers involve a number of additional risks  many of which are outside of our control  including failure of a contract manufacturer to manufacture products to our specifications or to deliver products in the quantities or timeframe that we require  failure of a contract manufacturer to comply with current good manufacturing practices or other regulatory requirements  a decision by the fda or other regulatory authorities not to approve our use of a particular contract manufacturer to supply our products  
table of contents intellectual property rights to any improvements in a manufacturing process or new manufacturing processes being owned by or shared with a contract manufacturer  or termination of an agreement with a contract manufacturer or increased prices charged by a contract manufacturer 
any of these factors could cause us to delay or suspend clinical trials  regulatory submissions or commercialization of our products and could result in significantly increased costs 
in addition  our future contract manufacturers may not be in the united states  and we currently utilize a contract manufacturer located outside the united states 
consequently  we may face additional manufacturing difficulties due to a number of potential factors  including importation and customs issues  political uncertainties and a potentially limited ability to enforce our contractual rights against parties not located within the united states 
any inability to protect our proprietary technologies could significantly harm our business and ability to successfully commercialize product candidates 
our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of other intellectual property for our technologies and products in the united states and other countries and prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights 
if we do not adequately protect our intellectual property  competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries 
we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies and products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
however  the patent positions of biotechnology companies  including our patent position  involve complex legal and factual questions  and  therefore  we cannot predict with certainty whether our patent applications will be approved or any resulting patents will be enforced 
patents may be challenged  deemed unenforceable  invalidated or circumvented 
thus  any patents that we own or license from third parties may not provide protection against competitors 
the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain  and we cannot ensure that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications  we or our licensors were the first to file patent applications for these inventions  others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies  any of our or our licensors pending patent applications will result in issued patents  any of our or our licensors patents will be valid or enforceable  any patents issued to us or our licensors and collaborators will provide a basis for commercially viable products  will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties  we will develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable  or the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business 
we apply for patents covering our technologies and drug candidates  as we deem appropriate 
however  we may fail to apply for patents on important technologies or products in a timely fashion or at all 
our existing patents and any 
table of contents kosan biosciences future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products and technologies 
for example  our lead product in our geldanamycin analog program  aag  is not covered by a composition of matter patent  and thus others could develop products containing aag 
we are aware of at least one other company that has been developing product candidates containing aag 
other competitors may be currently developing  or may in the future develop  products containing aag 
in addition  we generally do not control the patent prosecution of technology that we license from others 
accordingly  we are unable to exercise the same degree of control over this intellectual property as we would over our own 
in addition to patents  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how 
we have taken measures to protect our confidential information and trade secrets 
however  these measures may not provide adequate protection 
we seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees  collaborators  consultants and others 
nevertheless  parties may breach these agreements or competitors may otherwise obtain or independently develop our trade secrets 
claims by third parties of intellectual property infringement would require us to spend time and money and could deprive us of valuable rights needed to develop or commercialize our products 
our commercial success depends significantly on not infringing the patents and proprietary rights of other parties and not breaching any licenses that we have entered into with regard to our technologies and products 
other parties may currently or in the future possess intellectual property rights covering drug candidates that we are developing or desire to develop and genes  gene fragments  compounds and technologies we use or may wish to use 
any infringement of patent rights or violation of other proprietary rights may require us to obtain a license from another party  forego product development or commercialization or face lawsuits or other claims 
the biotechnology industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
we are aware of patents and published patent applications that  if valid  and if we are unsuccessful in circumventing or acquiring the rights to these patents  may block our ability to commercialize products based on the drug candidates that we are developing or pursue our pks polyketide synthase gene manipulation and production technologies 
we cannot be sure that other parties have not filed for or been issued relevant patents that could affect our ability to obtain patents or successfully operate our business 
others may challenge our patent or other intellectual property rights or sue us for patent infringement  misappropriation of their intellectual property rights or breach of license agreements 
we may be required to commence legal proceedings to resolve our patent or other intellectual property rights 
an adverse determination in any litigation or in administrative proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities  result in our patents being deemed invalid  unenforceable or revoked  require us to license disputed rights from others or to cease using the disputed technology 
in addition  our involvement in any of these proceedings may cause us to incur substantial costs and result in diversion of management and technical personnel 
we are aware of a significant number of patents and patent applications relating to aspects of our technologies and compounds filed by  and issued to  other parties 
others have filed patent applications or have been granted patents claiming inventions also claimed or licensed by us  and we may have to participate in an interference or other proceeding before a patent agency or court to determine priority of invention or which party was first to invent and  thus  the right to a patent for these inventions 
for example  we believe one or more interferences may be declared between patents and applications we own or have exclusively licensed and patents and applications owned by novartis relating to epothilone biosynthetic genes and epothilone d  patent applications believed by us to be licensed to bristol myers squibb relating to epothilones  and patents and applications owned by abbott laboratories and biotica ltd 
relating to erythromycin polyketide synthase genes  methods for altering polyketide synthase genes and 
table of contents erythromycin analogs 
biotica ltd 
has filed an opposition against one of our european patents related to the recombinant production of polyketides  we have filed a response and a hearing has been scheduled at the european patent office in the first half of in addition  the european patent office has recently granted european patents to the german research centre for biotechnology gbf  which we believe to be licensed to bristol myers squibb and  if valid in individual european countries  would cover epothilone d in those countries 
formal oppositions to these patents have been filed with the european patent office and we expect a response by gbf to those oppositions beginning the second half of we are also aware that the united states patent office has recently issued a notice of allowance to a patent application owned by oregon state university  which relates to kos a proceeding or a lawsuit in which we are alleged to have infringed an issued patent could result in substantial cost to us even if the outcome is favorable  and if the outcome is unfavorable  we could be required to license the other party s rights  on terms that may be unfavorable to us  or cease using the technology 
even if successful on priority grounds  an interference may result in loss of claims based on patentability grounds raised in the interference 
although patent and intellectual property disputes in the biotechnology area are often settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that a license would be available to us on satisfactory terms  if at all 
companies and others developing products that could compete with our product candidates  such as bristol myers squibb and novartis in the area of potential epothilone products  may be particularly unwilling to grant us a license at any price 
other parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that the use of our technologies infringes these patents or that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization 
we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any claims that the use of our technologies infringes any patents  defending ourselves against any claim that we are employing any proprietary technology without authorization or enforcing our patents against others 
furthermore  parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to develop  commercialize and sell products  and could result in the award of substantial damages against us 
in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us  we may be required to pay substantial damages  stop using certain products and methods  develop non infringing products and methods  and obtain one or more licenses from other parties 
we may not be able to obtain licenses from other parties at a reasonable cost  or at all 
if we are not able to obtain necessary licenses at a reasonable cost or at all  we could encounter substantial delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods and products  which we may not be able to accomplish 
litigation or the failure to obtain licenses could prevent us from manufacturing or commercializing products and could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operation 
if we are unable to recruit and retain skilled employees and consultants  we may not be able to successfully operate our business 
retaining our current employees and recruiting qualified scientific personnel to perform future research and development work  as well as manufacturing and key management personnel  will be critical to our success 
we may also need to hire personnel with expertise in clinical testing  government regulation  marketing  law and finance 
competition is intense among biotechnology  pharmaceutical and healthcare companies  universities and non profit research institutions for experienced scientists and other personnel  and we may not be able to retain or recruit 
table of contents kosan biosciences sufficient skilled personnel on acceptable terms to allow us to pursue collaborations and develop our products and core technologies to the extent otherwise possible 
in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement no 
revised share based payment  or sfas r  which will require us to record a charge to earnings for the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions  including stock options and employee stock purchase plans  effective july  we are currently evaluating option valuation methodologies and assumptions permitted by the fasb for purposes of implementing the change in accounting treatment 
this change will have a negative impact on our financial results 
for an illustration of the effect of such a change in our recent financial results  see note to the notes to financial statements summary of significant accounting policies stock options plans 
in addition  new regulations implemented by the nasdaq national market requiring shareholder approval for all stock option plans  as well as new regulations implemented by the new york stock exchange prohibiting nyse member organizations from giving a proxy to vote on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions  could make it more difficult for us to grant options to employees in the future 
to the extent that new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant stock options to employees  we may incur increased compensation costs  change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  each of which could materially and adversely affect our business 
we face intense competition from large pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies and academic groups 
we face  and will continue to face  intense competition from organizations such as large biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  as well as academic and research institutions and government agencies  that are pursuing competing technologies and products 
these organizations may develop or currently possess technologies or products that are superior alternatives to ours 
for example  competing epothilones in clinical development include those being developed by bristol myers squibb reported to be in phase iii clinical trials  novartis ag reported to be in phase ii clinical trials and schering ag reported to be in phase i clinical trials 
in hsp inhibitors  conforma therapeutics has initiated phase i clinical trials with their formulation of aag 
further  our competitors in the polyketide gene engineering field may be more effective at implementing their technologies to develop commercial products or may hold or develop patents or other proprietary rights that may prevent us from practicing our technologies and pursuing our programs 
some of these competitors have entered into collaborations with leading companies within our target markets to produce polyketides for commercial purposes 
any products that we develop through our technologies will compete in multiple  highly competitive markets 
development of pharmaceutical products requires significant investment and resources 
many of the organizations competing with us in the markets for such products have greater capital resources  research and development and marketing staffs  facilities and capabilities  and greater experience in discovery and developing drugs  obtaining regulatory approvals and product manufacturing and marketing 
accordingly  our competitors may succeed in more rapidly developing and marketing technologies and products that are more effective than our technologies and products or that would render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
we believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on  among other things our ability to develop novel compounds with attractive pharmaceutical properties and to secure and protect intellectual property rights based on our innovations  the efficacy  safety and reliability of our product candidates  the speed at which we develop our product candidates  our ability to design and successfully execute appropriate clinical trials  
table of contents the timing and scope of regulatory approvals  our ability to manufacture and sell commercial quantities of future products to the market  and acceptance of future products by physicians and other healthcare providers 
if we face product liability claims  these claims will divert our management s time and we will incur litigation costs  and if we are held liable  our business  financial condition and results of operation may be materially harmed 
we face an inherent business risk of liability claims in the event that the use of our potential products in clinical trials or otherwise  or any other products manufactured in our facility  results in personal injury or death 
even though we have obtained product liability insurance  it may not be sufficient to cover claims that may be made against us 
product liability insurance is expensive  difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
any claims against us  regardless of their merit  could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operation  because litigation related to these claims would strain our financial resources in addition to consuming the time and attention of our management 
if we are sued for any injuries caused by our products or products manufactured at our facility  our liability could exceed our total assets 
we use hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological materials in our business 
any claims relating to improper handling  storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly 
our research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  including hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological materials 
some of these materials may be novel  including bacteria with novel properties and bacteria that produce biologically active compounds 
our operations also produce hazardous waste products 
we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials 
federal  state and local laws and regulations govern the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials 
we could be subject to civil damages in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of  or exposure of individuals to  hazardous materials 
in addition  we could be sued for injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties or our collaborators of these materials  and our liability may exceed our total assets 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive  and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research  development or commercialization efforts 
we have a stockholders rights plan and anti takeover provisions in our corporate charter documents that may result in outcomes with which you do not agree 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of those shares without further vote or action by our stockholders 
the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future may adversely affect the rights of the holders of common stock 
the issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for third parties to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
our certificate of incorporation provides for staggered terms for the members of the board of directors and prevents our stockholders from acting by written consent 
these provisions and other provisions of our bylaws and of delaware law applicable to us could delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us 
this could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions 
in addition  these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors 
this is because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team 

table of contents kosan biosciences we have adopted a rights agreement under which all stockholders have the right to purchase shares of a new series of preferred stock at an exercise price of per one one hundredth of a share  if a person acquires more than of our common stock 
the rights plan could make it more difficult for a person to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
the rights plan could also reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and result in the market price being lower than it would be without the rights plan 
in addition  the existence of the rights plan itself may deter a potential acquiror from acquiring us 
as a result  either by operation of the rights plan or by its potential deterrent effect  mergers and acquisitions of us that our stockholders may consider in their best interests may not occur 
some of our existing stockholders can exert control over us and may not make decisions that are in the best interest of all stockholders 
our officers  directors and their affiliates together controlled approximately of our outstanding common stock as of december  as a result  these stockholders  if they act together  are able to exert a significant degree of influence over our management and affairs and over matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control of us and might affect the market price of our common stock  even when a change may be in the best interests of all stockholders 
in addition  the interests of this concentration of ownership may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders  and accordingly  they could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements  which we would not otherwise consider 
our stock price has been  and may continue to be  extremely volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  highly volatile 
during the period from december  through december   our common stock traded between and on the nasdaq national market 
the trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including announcements of technological developments in research by us or our competitors  delay or failure in initiating  conducting  completing or analyzing clinical trials or unsatisfactory design or results of these trials by our collaborators or us  developments in clinical trials for potentially competitive product candidates  changes in the united states or foreign health care systems or regulations  regulatory approvals for competitive product candidates or delays or failures by our collaborators or us in obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates  new products or services introduced or announced by us or our competitors  published reports by securities analysts  announcements of expirations  terminations or amendments of collaborations  licenses or government research grants  or announcements that we have entered into new collaboration  licensing or similar arrangements  departures of key personnel  developments or disputes as to patent or other proprietary rights  litigation or an unfavorable outcome in litigation  sales of our common stock  announcements of  and actual or anticipated fluctuations in  our financial results  and economic and other external factors  disasters or crises 

table of contents in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq national market and the market for biotechnology companies in particular  has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company 
if this type of litigation were instituted against us  we would be faced with substantial costs and management s attention and resources would be diverted  which could in turn seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we expect that our quarterly results of operations will fluctuate  and this fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline  creating investor losses 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
these fluctuations could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly or decline 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include expiration or termination of research contracts with collaborators or government research grants  which may not be renewed or replaced  the success rate of our efforts leading to milestone payments and royalties under our collaboration agreement with roche or any future collaboration or license agreements  the timing and willingness of collaborators to develop and commercialize our products  general and industry specific economic conditions  which may affect our collaborators research and development expenditures  and costs and expenses related to any litigation or administrative proceedings in which we may be involved 
we expect a large portion of our expenses to be relatively fixed  including expenses for facilities  equipment and personnel 
accordingly  if revenues decline or do not grow due to expiration  termination or amendment of current or future collaboration agreements  licenses or government research grants  failure to obtain new contracts or other factors  we may not be able to reduce our operating expenses correspondingly 
in addition  we expect operating expenses to continue to increase 
failure to achieve anticipated levels of revenues could therefore significantly harm our operating results for a particular fiscal period 
due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenues and expenses  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
our operating results in some quarters may not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors 
in that case  our stock price would probably decline 
changes in the accounting treatment of stock options will adversely affect our results of operations 
changes in the accounting treatment of stock options will require us to account for employee stock options as compensation expense on our financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement no 
revised share based payment  or sfas r  which will require us to record a charge to earnings for the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions  including stock options and employee stock purchase plans  effective july  we are currently evaluating option valuation methodologies and assumptions permitted by the fasb for purposes of implementing the change in accounting treatment 
this change will have a negative impact on our financial results 
for an illustration of the effect of such a change in our recent financial results  see note to the notes to financial statements summary of significant accounting policies stock options plans 

table of contents kosan biosciences if we are unable to favorably assess the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting  or if our independent auditors are unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on our assessment  our stock price could be adversely affected 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  on an annual basis  our management is required to report on  and our independent auditors to attest to  the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
the rules governing the standards that must be met for management to make its annual assessment are complex and require significant documentation and testing 
while our internal controls over financial reporting were deemed effective by both our management and our independent auditors as of december   there may be changes in our systems  processes or operations that will effect the effectiveness of internal controls in the future 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
our future assessments of internal controls may continue to result in increased expenses and the devotion of significant management resources 
if we cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in the future  or if our independent auditors are unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on our assessment  investor confidence and our stock price could be adversely affected

in collaboration with hoffmann la roche inc and f 
hoffmann la roche ltd  collectively roche  we are testing kos  a potential anticancer agent  in phase ii and phase ib clinical trials 
the two current phase ii studies are simon two stage design trials that have an interim review and decision point following the completion of stage one before advancing to stage two 
the phase ii clinical trial in breast cancer is currently in stage one  with a review and decision point expected in the first half of a phase ii clinical trial in prostate cancer commenced stage one in the first quarter of  with a review and decision point expected in the second half of in june  the phase ii clinical trial of kos in colorectal cancer was discontinued due to unanticipated cumulative drug toxicities in patients who had been previously treated with the cancer treatment  oxaliplatin 
in the fourth quarter of  the phase ii clinical trial of kos in non small cell lung cancer was discontinued as it did not meet the primary objective of tumor response in the first stage of the simon two stage trial design 
the three phase ib trials are traditional dose escalating trials in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents 
kos nd generation epothilone d 
in december  in collaboration with roche  we initiated a phase i clinical trial in solid tumors of our second generation epothilone product candidate  kos  as an anticancer agent 
aag geldanamycin analog 
the original formulation of aag is being evaluated in multiple phase ii and phase ib clinical trials sponsored by the nci under a crada between us and the nci cancer therapy evaluation program  or ctep 
kos proprietary formulation of aag

in collaboration with the nci  we are developing kos  for which phase i clinical trials in solid tumors were initiated in under a kosan sponsored ind that was filed in december  we plan to initiate phase i clinical trials of kos in hematologic malignancies in the first half of we also have additional product candidates in the areas of gastrointestinal motility and infectious disease that are undergoing preclinical evaluation and several early stage product and research technology development programs largely based on polyketides 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we expect to incur additional operating losses over the next several years as we continue to develop our technologies and fund internal product research and development 
critical accounting policies and management estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our research and development collaborations  
table of contents investments  deferred tax assets and their related valuation allowance  financing operations and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  which have been reviewed by our audit committee  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize license and other up front fees over the estimated research and development term of the agreement 
if the agreement does not have a specified research and development term  we must apply judgment in determining the appropriate level of recognition 
as of december   we had million in deferred revenue  representing the unamortized balance of the million initial fee received in connection with our collaboration with roche 
this initial fee is being amortized through the second half of  the current estimated clinical development period 
in december  upon the commencement of a phase i clinical trial of kos  our second generation epothilone d compound  we determined that the estimated clinical development period extended from the second half of  which was initially estimated when we entered into the collaboration with roche in  to the second half of our initial estimate of the clinical development period contemplated development of one product candidate  kos the change in our estimate has resulted in a further deferral of the unrecognized portion of the initial fee 
any changes in our estimate will result in either an acceleration or further deferral of the related revenue recognition 
clinical trial accruals over the next year  the clinical trials of our epothilone and geldanamycin analog programs will significantly increase our development expenditures 
research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred 
our expenses related to clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are established prior to the initiation of the related clinical trial  thus establishing the basis of our estimates 
however  these terms may be subject to amendment due to changes in the scope and length of the related clinical trial 
expenses related to clinical trials generally are accrued based on the level of patient enrollment and activity according to the protocol 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activity and adjust our estimates accordingly 
the process by which we currently estimate our clinical trial accruals is consistent with prior periods and  in the past  there have not been significant adjustments of the actual results to our estimates 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense for options granted to non employees has been determined as the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measured 
we recognized other stock based compensation for non employees of approximately  in   in  and million in in addition  assuming no changes  we expect to recognize other stock based compensation in connection with stock options granted to non employees of approximately  in   in   in and  in the measurement of stock based compensation to non employees is subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying securities vest 
as such  changes to these future period measurements could be substantial should we experience significant changes in our stock price 
for example  a increase in the price of our stock  from that of december   would translate into an approximately increase in the related estimated expenses above

table of contents kosan biosciences in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  which will require us to record a charge to earnings for the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions  including stock options and employee stock purchase plans  effective july  we are currently evaluating option valuation methodologies and assumptions permitted by the fasb for purposes of implementing the change in accounting treatment 
this change will have a negative impact on our financial results 
for an illustration of the effect of such a change in our recent financial results  see note to the notes to financial statements summary of significant accounting policies stock options plans 
the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the amounts related to sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend will vary due to certain factors  including but not limited to  the number of new option grants and purchases made under the employee stock purchase plan  employee terminations  and changes in our stock price  and related assumptions

we allocate salary driven and space use driven overhead expenses to research and development and to general and administrative expenses based on salaries and space utilization by each respective area 
our research and development employees decreased to in from in in  we experienced increased salary and personnel related expenses resulting from a controlled shift from research skilled employees to more development skilled employees as we continue to advance our product candidates into clinical development 
we expect our research and development expenses will increase substantially as kos  kos  kos and kos advance further into the clinic  and as we advance our research programs into later stages of development

roche is responsible for the majority of the costs of the epothilone clinical trials conducted under our collaboration and is funding all of the kos and kos clinical trials other than the kos prostate cancer trial  which we are currently funding 
we are responsible at our cost to supply aag for clinical trials sponsored by the nci under the cradas  and the nci is responsible for the remainder of the costs of these trials through phase ii 
in addition  we are sponsoring other clinical trials of kos and plan to sponsor kos clinical trials at our sole expense

interest income  interest expense and gain on the recovery of investment in thousands  except percentages years ended december  annual percent change interest income interest expense gain on the recovery of investment other income  net interest income 
interest income increased to approximately million in from approximately million in this increase was primarily due to higher average investment balances that resulted from our registered direct offering in december interest income decreased to approximately million in from approximately million in this decrease was due to lower average investment balances and lower investment yields associated with the declining interest rate environment in interest expense 
interest expense increased to approximately  in from approximately  in this increase was due to additional equipment debt financing and an increasing rate environment during  which resulted in a higher average debt balance at higher average interest rates 
interest expense decreased to  in from  in this decrease resulted from the scheduled repayment of existing debt at higher average interest rates  partially offset by additional equipment debt financing at lower average interest rates in we expect our interest expense will increase in the future resulting from additional property and equipment related debt financings in the increasing interest rate environment 
gain on the recovery of investment 
at june   we determined that an other than temporary decline in the fair value of our investment in short term commercial paper of southern california edison  a utility company  had occurred 
accordingly  we recorded approximately  loss on the related write down in the carrying value of the investment 
in march  the security was fully repaid

the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in the year through  if not utilized 
the state research and development carryforwards do not expire 
use of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization

we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors  including the following our ability to establish any new collaborations  our rights and obligations under any new collaboration agreements and our ability to generate revenues under any new collaborations  the progress  number and costs of our research programs  the extent to which clinical and other development activities are funded by our current collaborators  roche and the nci  the progress  success and costs of preclinical testing and clinical trials of our drug candidates  our ability to maintain or extend our existing collaborations with roche and the nci  the costs and timing of obtaining  enforcing and defending patent and other intellectual property rights  any need to obtain licenses to additional patents or other intellectual property in order to use  import  manufacture  market or sell our product candidates  our ability to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates and the costs and timing of doing so  any need to expand our manufacturing capabilities  any need to build commercial infrastructure to market our products  and expenses associated with any possible future litigation 
in addition  we review from time to time potential opportunities to expand our technologies or add to our portfolio of drug candidates 
in the future  we may need further capital in order to acquire or invest in technologies  products or businesses 
we expect that additional financing will be required in the future to fund operations 
we expect to finance future cash needs through the sale of equity securities  strategic collaborations  government grant awards and debt financing 
in september  we filed a registration statement on form s to offer to sell common stock in one or more offerings up to a dollar amount of million

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investments to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and investment grade corporate obligations 
although changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our portfolio and cause unrealized gains and losses  such gains and losses would not be realized unless the investments were sold prior to maturity 
through our money managers  we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate risk 
the risk management control systems use analytical techniques  including sensitivity analysis 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points  or  at december  rates  the fair value of our portfolio would decline by approximately  on that date
