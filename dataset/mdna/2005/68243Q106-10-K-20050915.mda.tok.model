during the fiscal year ended june   the company s combined telephonic and online sales channels experienced strong growth in the floral and complementary gift categories of gourmet food gifts  such as the popcorn factory line of products  gift baskets and children s gifts  but this growth was partially offset by slower sales in the home and garden gift category as a result of internal marketing and merchandising issues  as well as increasingly competitive market conditions 
the company fulfilled approximately   and  orders through its combined telephonic and online sales channels during the fiscal years ended july   june   and june   respectively  representing increases of and over the respective prior fiscal years 
order volume through the company s online sales channel increased and  during the years ended july  and june   respectively  as a result of improved conversion of qualified traffic through the company s websites  and increased marketing efforts through search engines and affiliates

the company intends to continue to drive revenue growth through its online sales channel and continue the migration of its customers from the telephone to the web for several important reasons i online orders are less expensive to process than telephonic orders  ii online customers can view the company s full range of gift offerings  including non floral gifts  which in many cases yield higher gross margin opportunities  iii online customers can utilize all of the company s services  such as the various gift search functions  order status check and reminder service  thereby deepening the relationship with its customers and leading to increased order rates  and iv when customers visit the company online  it provides an opportunity to interact with them in an electronic dialog via cost efficient marketing programs 
retail fulfillment revenues for the fiscal years ended july  and june  increased in comparison to the prior years  primarily as a result of increased membership and sales of products to the company s bloomnet r members 
additionally  during fiscal the company generated winery services revenue via its november acquisition of the winetasting network and retail and wholesale bakery product revenue via its march acquisition of cheryl co 
at the start of the second half of fiscal  the company initiated a strategy designed to extend the company s leadership position in the floral and thoughtful gift marketplace  and implemented plans to increase its marketing spending to drive increased customer acquisition particularly in the core floral gift category 
as a result  during the fiscal year ended july   non floral gift products accounted for of total combined telephonic and online net revenues  compared to and during the years ended june  and june   respectively 
the company intends to continue to execute against this plan  and in addition to increasing its media presence  the company will expand its bloomnet business to business floral operations  build out its technology platform  and increase the depth of its marketing programs and personnel within its recently acquired wine gift business and cookies and baked goods product line which support the company s growing gourmet gift and gift basket product line

com  inc  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory and long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition net revenues are generated by online  telephonic and retail fulfillment operations and primarily consist of the selling price of merchandise  service or outbound shipping charges  less discounts  returns and credits 
net revenues are recognized upon product shipment 
accounts receivable the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers or franchisees to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers or franchisees were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory the company states inventory at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with inventory levels 
it is possible that changes in consumer demand could cause a reduction in the net realizable value of inventory 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is evaluated annually for impairment 
the cost of intangible assets with determinable lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed  on a straight line basis  over the estimated periods benefited  ranging from to years 
the company periodically evaluates acquired businesses for potential impairment indicators 
judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on market conditions and operational performance of the company 
future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
capitalized software the carrying value of capitalized software  both purchased and internally developed  is periodically reviewed for potential impairment indicators 
future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that capitalized software is impaired 
income taxes the company has established deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the income tax bases of its assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled 
the company has recognized as a deferred tax asset the tax benefits associated with losses related to operations  which are expected to result in a future tax benefit 
realization of this deferred tax asset assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income so that these assets will be realized 
the factors that we consider in assessing the likelihood of realization include the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
this statement revises sfas no 
by eliminating the option to account for employee stock options under apb no 
and generally requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards the fair value based method 
the company is adopting sfas r effective july  using the modified prospective method 
the impact of adopting sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on the levels of share based compensation granted in the future  however  had the company adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the proforma disclosure  excluding the impact of the option acceleration described in note to the consolidated financial statements
