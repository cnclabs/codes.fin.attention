item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we are a leading retailer of financial services  including check cashing  short term consumer loans and bill payment services 
as of june   we had a total network of  stores in states and the district of columbia  consisting of  company owned stores and franchised stores 
this makes us the largest owner  operator and franchisor of check cashing stores in the united states and one of the largest providers of short term consumer loans  also known as payday loans 
we focus on serving unbanked and underbanked consumers  many of whom seek alternatives to traditional banking relationships in order to gain convenient and immediate access to check cashing services and short term consumer loans 
we seek to develop and maintain the largest network of stores in each of the markets where we operate 
our growth strategy is to open new stores  franchise stores in new and existing markets  opportunistically acquire stores  increase our customer base and introduce new services into our store network 
our stores offer check cashing  loans and other retail financial services at competitive rates in clean settings during hours convenient for our customers 
our stores are located in highly visible  accessible locations  usually in strip shopping centers  free standing buildings and kiosks located inside retail stores 
for our check cashing services  we charge our customers fees that are usually equal to a percentage of the amount of the check being cashed and are deducted from the cash provided to the customer 
for our short term consumer loans  we receive interest on the loans 
for the republic bank loans and the first bank of delaware loans offered at certain of our stores  we receive origination and servicing fees from such bank 
our expenses primarily relate to the operations of our stores  including salaries and benefits for our employees  occupancy expense for our leased real estate  security expenses  returns and cash shortages  loan loss provisions  depreciation of our assets and corporate and other expenses  including costs related to store openings and closings 
regulatory developments the federal deposit insurance corporation  or fdic  issued guidelines governing permissible arrangements between a state chartered bank and a marketer and servicer of its payday loans in july  and issued revised guidelines in march the guidelines apply to our marketing and servicing agreements with republic bank and first bank of delaware regarding the offering of each such bank s loans at our stores in arkansas  pennsylvania and texas and our servicing activities regarding those loans 
the guidelines describe the fdic s expectations for a bank s prudent risk management practices regarding payday loan marketing and servicing relationships 
they address bank capital requirements  allowances for loan losses and loan classifications as well as income recognition  collection recovery practices and compliance with consumer protection laws when a bank engages in payday lending 
the revised fdic guidelines issued in march include a requirement that banks such as republic bank and first bank of delaware develop procedures to ensure that a payday loan is not provided to any customer with payday loans from any lender for more than three months in the previous months 
assuming an average term of approximately days  this limits the number of payday loans a customer may have from all lenders during any month period to six 
the revised fdic guidelines also suggest that supervised lenders should offer a customer subject to such a limitation  or refer such a customer to  a longer term loan product 
the revised fdic guidelines became effective july  in response to the revised fdic guidelines  since august   customers at our stores in texas  pennsylvania and arkansas who are denied a shorter term republic loan  may apply for a longer term first bank of delaware installment loan 
it is unclear at this time what procedures and or alternate products the fdic may accept as conforming with the revised guidelines 
if the implementation and enforcement of the revised fdic guidelines or any newly promulgated guidelines by the fdic  or any order  law  rule or regulation by the states of kentucky or delaware or the fdic  were to have the effect of significantly curtailing either republic bank s short term consumer lending services or first bank of delaware s installment lending services  our revenues derived from fees from republic bank or first bank of delaware would be materially adversely affected  unless we could offer  or we could secure an agreement with another financial institution not subject to such limitations to offer  similar or alternate services 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in offering similar or alternate services or finding such a replacement financial institution  in the latter case especially because arrangements like ours with republic bank and first bank of delaware are coming under increasing political and regulatory scrutiny 
lawsuits filed against banks offering these short term consumer loans  such as one filed by the new york state attorney general s office in september against a delaware state chartered bank and the companies servicing its short term consumer loans through a structure that is in some respects similar to our agreements with republic bank and first bank of delaware  may hinder our ability to partner with a replacement bank or to establish relationships with new banks in other states as part of our 
table of contents growth strategy 
any alternate or similar services or agreement with a replacement bank or new bank may also not be on terms as favorable to us as our current agreements with republic bank and first bank of delaware 
critical accounting policies and estimates the process of preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions to determine the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base these estimates and assumptions upon the best information available to us at the time the estimates or assumptions are made 
the most significant estimates made by our management  which we consider critical  include our allowance for loan losses and accrued liability for loan losses payable to republic bank  valuation of goodwill  income taxes  and valuation of self insured liabilities  because these estimates and assumptions could change materially as conditions both within and beyond our control change 
accordingly  our actual results could differ materially from our estimates 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and the related management estimates and assumptions necessary in determining the value of related assets or liabilities 
a full description of all of our significant accounting policies is included in note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
allowance for loan losses and accrued liability for loan losses payable to republic bank 
we establish an allowance for loan losses based on our estimates of the amount of uncollectible loans in our loan portfolio 
we also establish a liability for loan losses payable to republic bank based on our estimates of the amount of uncollectible loans in republic bank s loan portfolio 
the loan loss allowance and liability to republic bank are considered critical because they are material  subjective  and involve estimates 
we determine the required allowance and liability using information such as recent loan loss experience and economic trends and conditions 
while the estimates can be affected by operations experience and regulatory changes  historically  our allowance and liability levels have remained consistent as a percentage of their respective loan portfolios 
we regularly review our loss exposure to determine appropriate loss reserve amounts  as well as to determine strategies that could minimize our future exposure 
while we believe our current allowance and liability are adequate  we could be negatively affected if we experience a higher than historical level of losses in the short term  which would require us to increase our provision for loan losses and accrual for loan losses payable to republic bank 
goodwill 
from time to time  we acquire individual stores or a group of stores 
when we enter into these acquisitions  we value the underlying tangible and intangible assets and record the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired as goodwill 
we review the carrying value of goodwill annually or when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
we review the carrying value of goodwill using a discounted cash flow model of the expected net cash flows of the business 
the most significant variables used in the model include expected revenues  incremental costs and working capital requirements 
we regularly compare actual results to expected performance  but in the event we experience significant declines in revenue levels or significant increases in operating costs  the value of goodwill could be impaired  and we might be required to write down the recorded value of goodwill 
income taxes 
we establish our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on our profits or losses in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
we periodically assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets and would record a valuation allowance based on the amount of deferred tax assets that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we base our judgment of the recoverability of our deferred tax asset primarily on historical earnings  our estimate of current and expected future earnings  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  and current and future ownership changes 
a significant adverse change in any one or several of these factors would materially affect our assessment of the likelihood of recoverability of our deferred tax assets and would impact the amount of tax expense we record 
historically  we have fully recovered our deferred tax assets as estimated 
self insurance liabilities 
we are self insured for workers compensation  general liability and medical liability claims not otherwise covered by third party insurance policies 
the established self insured reserves are determined by a review of actuarial assessments and historical loss experience  and may be adjusted based on higher or lower actual loss experience 
in the event that we experience higher than expected losses  we may be required to increase the levels of our self insured liabilities and or record a charge to cover uninsured losses 
historically  our calculated reserves for self insured liabilities have been adequate 
summary of annual results our fiscal total revenue was approximately million  or  higher than our fiscal total revenue 
this increase resulted primarily from an approximate million  or  increase in loan related revenue  an approximate million  or  increase in check cashing fees  and an approximate million  or  increase in bill payment including 
table of contents debit card revenue 
our net income was approximately million  with diluted earnings per share of  compared to our net income of approximately million  with diluted earnings per share of 
during the quarter ended march   we performed a review of our accounting practices surrounding leases and lease related items in light of the views that the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission  expressed in a letter dated february  to the american institute of certified public accountants  regarding the application of generally accepted accounting principles to operating lease accounting matters 
historically  we recorded rent expense on a straight line basis over the initial non cancelable term of a lease commencing upon store opening 
we concluded that the calculation for straight line rent should be based on the reasonably assured lease term as defined in sfas  accounting for leases  which in most cases exceeds the initial non cancelable lease term 
in addition  we reassessed the depreciable lives of leasehold improvements to be the shorter of their estimated useful life or the reasonably assured lease term at the inception of the lease 
further  we concluded that landlord allowances which had previously been recorded as a reduction to related leasehold improvements should be reflected as deferred rent and amortized over the reasonably assured lease term as a reduction to rent expense rather than depreciation 
we have restated our june  balance sheet to record a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings of million related to periods prior to and including fiscal for periods subsequent to the end of fiscal  we recorded a one time non cash after tax adjustment of million in the third quarter of fiscal to reflect the cumulative impact of correcting our accounting practices related to leased stores 
this adjustment resulted in a reduction in diluted earnings per share in the third quarter of fiscal we evaluated the materiality of these corrections on our financial statements and concluded that the incremental impact of these corrections is not material to any quarterly or annual period in fiscal or fiscal other than the cumulative adjustment discussed above  prior years financial results will not be restated 
the adjustments required to correct these practices does not affect historical or future net cash flows or the timing of the payments under the related leases

in the first six months of fiscal  we gradually ceased to offer goleta loans and began to offer state regulated short term consumer loans at our owned stores 
as of december   goleta loans were no longer offered at any of our stores  though we continued to collect outstanding goleta loans until june  because our short term consumer loans are substantially similar to the goleta loans formerly offered  our method for determining our loan loss allowance for both types of loans is the same 
our current policy for determining the loan loss allowance is based on historical experience  as well as the results of management s review and analysis of the payment and collection of the loans within the last fiscal quarter 
we have determined  based on recent operating history  that we receive payment of approximately for loans maturing in the first  second and fourth fiscal quarters or for loans maturing during tax refund season in the third fiscal quarter of the loan volume  or principal amount of the loans 
therefore  the loan loss allowance is approximately of the principal amount of the loans maturing in the first  second and fourth fiscal quarters and approximately of the principal amount of the loans maturing in the third fiscal quarter 
our policy is to charge off all of our short term consumer loans  or participation interests in goleta loans  which are days or more past due or delinquent 
charge offs are applied as a reduction to the loan loss allowance  and any recoveries of previously charged off loans or participation interests in goleta loans are applied as an increase to the loan loss allowance 
the type of loans we offer typically have a term of only two to four weeks  and when the loan matures  the loan no longer accrues interest 
at the end of each fiscal quarter  we analyze the loan loss provision and the allowance that has been computed based on the activity described above to determine if the allowance is adequate based on our understanding of what is occurring in the stores with customers  past loan loss experience  current economic conditions  volume and growth of the loan portfolio  timing of maturity  as well as collections experience 
for this purpose  we treat each renewal of a loan in which no additional principal is advanced as a continuation of the initial loan 
if necessary  we make adjustments to the provision and the allowance 
as a result of our regular review of our loan loss exposure  effective july   the provision rate was reduced by basis points from the same period last year 
an analysis of the loan loss allowance with reference to our gross loans receivable which does not include any republic bank loans is as follows year ended june  in thousands ace loans gross loans receivable  beginning of period originations repayments charge offs recoveries gross loans receivable  end of period

under this agreement  we provide various services to republic bank in connection with our marketing and servicing of republic bank s short term consumer loans in exchange for which we are paid fees by republic bank 
we also earn additional fees if republic bank s quarterly loan loss rate for these short term consumer loans is below specified levels 
as of june   republic bank was offering its republic bank loans in of our company owned stores in arkansas  pennsylvania and texas 
approximately million  or of our total revenues  in fiscal and approximately million  or of our total revenues  in fiscal were derived from fees paid to us by republic bank 
although we market and service these republic bank loans  republic bank is responsible for reviewing each loan application and determining whether such application is approved for a loan 
we are not involved in the loan approval process  including with respect to determining the loan approval procedures or criteria  nor do we acquire or own any participation interest in these loans 
consequently  republic bank loans are not included in our loan portfolio or in our loans receivable and are not reflected on our balance sheet 
under our agreement  however  we are obligated to reimburse republic bank by paying it an amount equal to the net amount charged off by republic bank  regarding its loans in our stores 
therefore  we could be obligated to pay republic bank for loan losses in an amount up to the total outstanding amount of republic bank loans recorded on republic bank s financial statements  which was million as of june  because of our economic exposure for losses related to the republic bank loans  we have established a payable to reflect our anticipated losses related to uncollected republic bank loans that are days or more past due 
though we have not had any long term experience with republic bank loans  we believe that the loss experience with republic bank loans will be similar to the loss experience with our other loans because the loan products are similar in term  amount and credit quality 
accordingly  the payable for amounts due to republic bank for losses regarding republic bank loans has been established using the same methodology discussed in the loan portfolio disclosure 
we cannot assure you  however  that our estimates will be accurate  and if the republic bank loan losses are materially greater than our recorded amount payable to republic bank  our financial condition could be materially adversely affected

in this case  a quarterly portfolio is all of the republic bank loans that matured in a particular fiscal quarter 
we can track the payment rates at different points of time for each quarterly portfolio 
the assumed higher rate of payment in our third fiscal quarter is a result of improved collections during the annual tax season because of borrowers receipt of tax refunds

during fiscal  we opened company owned stores  including ace cash advance stores 
we expect to open approximately to new ace cash express stores and to new ace cash advance stores  resulting in a net gain of approximately to company owned stores  in fiscal the capital cost of opening a new ace cash express store varies depending on the size and type of store  but is typically in the range of  to  before the moneygram incentive 
this capital cost includes leasehold improvements  signage  computer equipment and security systems 
moneygram pays us an incentive for each new ace cash express company owned location opened  which is accounted for as deferred revenue that is recognized over the remaining life of our contract with moneygram 
during fiscal  we opened ace cash express stores 
in addition  the typical store requires working capital of  to  to fund operating cash and the store s loan portfolio 
the capital cost of a mature ace cash advance store is typically in the range of  to  and includes leasehold improvements  signage  computer equipment and security systems 
a new ace cash advance store requires working capital of  to  during fiscal  we opened ace cash advance stores 
for the year ended june   we spent million on capital expenditures 
our total capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  are anticipated to be approximately million during our fiscal year ending june   in connection with the opening new stores  the relocation or remodeling of certain existing stores  maintenance  and ongoing upgrades of our information system 
the actual amount of capital expenditures will depend in part on the number of new stores opened  the number of stores acquired  and the number of existing stores that are relocated or remodeled 
we believe that our existing resources  anticipated cash flows from operations  and credit facilities will be sufficient to finance its anticipated capital expenditures and operational requirements during fiscal the to ace cash express stores and the to ace cash advance stores  after closings and dispositions  will require approximately million of working capital to fund operating cash and additions to our loan portfolio 
existing credit facilities our existing credit facilities are provided under a first amended and restated credit agreement with a syndicate of banks led by wells fargo bank  national association  as administrative agent for itself and the other lenders thereunder 
the existing credit agreement  which we entered into on july   amended and restated the credit agreement that we originally entered into on march  and that was effective as amended throughout fiscal  as described under fiscal credit facilities below 
the existing credit agreement provides two revolving line of credit facilities that expire june  a million primary revolving credit facility that is available throughout the four year term  and a million seasonal revolving credit facility that is available during each calendar year end holiday and tax season ie  december through march during the four year term 
the outstanding balance as of june  was million  with an available balance on the primary revolving credit facility of million 
the seasonal revolving credit facility of million is only available during tax season 
the revolving line of credit facilities include  subject to certain conditions  a letter of credit facility from wells fargo bank of up to million 
borrowings under the existing credit agreement bear interest at a variable annual rate equal to  at our discretion  either the sum of a the greatest of i the prime rate publicly announced by wells fargo bank  ii one percent plus the rate of interest on the secondary market for three month certificates of deposit reported by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the board of governors  multiplied by a fraction  the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is one minus the maximum reserve percentages required by the board of governors to

we selected the third alternative described above as the annual interest rate for our borrowings under the credit agreement  and as of june   that interest rate was calculated using libor plus 
upon an event of default under the existing credit agreement  the applicable annual interest rate is increased by three hundred basis points 
interest on the outstanding principal amount borrowed under the existing credit agreement is payable monthly 
the outstanding principal amount borrowed and all interest accrued under the primary revolving line of credit facility is payable on june  the outstanding principal amount and all interest accrued under the seasonal revolving line of credit facility is payable on march of each year 
at the end of each fiscal quarter  beginning september   we must pay the lenders a commitment fee equal to per annum of the average daily unused portion of the credit available under the existing credit agreement which is the unused portion of the million throughout the year and the unused portion of the million seasonal facility from december through march each year 
we must also pay wells fargo bank an annual agency fee of  in advance on each july we paid million in arrangement fees and up front fees relating to the existing credit agreement 
we may a at any time reduce  in whole or in part in million increments  the available amount of the credit facilities provided in the existing credit agreement and b subject to certain conditions  prepay  in whole or in part  the revolving credit facilities provided by the existing credit agreement without penalty or premium 
the existing credit agreement may be terminated before the stated expiration or maturity date of the revolving credit facilities requiring all unpaid principal and accrued interest to be paid to the lenders upon any event of default as defined in the existing credit agreement 
the events of default in the existing credit agreement include a nonpayment of amounts due under the existing credit agreement  b the failure to observe or perform covenants set forth in the existing credit agreement and in the documents ancillary thereto that are not cured  c a change in control of us  and d any event or circumstance that has a material adverse effect on the collateral secured under the existing credit agreement or on our business  assets  liabilities  condition financial or otherwise  or prospects 
we are subject to various restrictive covenants stated in the existing credit agreement 
those restrictive covenants  which are typical of those found in credit agreements of these types  include restrictions on the incurrence of indebtedness from other sources  restrictions on advances to or investments in other persons or entities  restrictions on the payment of dividends to shareholders and on the repurchase of shares  and the requirement that various financial ratios be maintained 
certain of the covenants in the existing credit agreement require us to limit our capital expenditures during each fiscal year to million  to limit any single acquisition of assets or capital stock of an entity in the retail financial services business to a purchase price of no more than million and to assets or entities that have a positive cash flow for the months preceding such acquisition  unless otherwise agreed upon by the lenders  to reduce our risk of increases in interest rates by entering into one or more interest rate swap agreements to convert to fixed rate obligations our floating or variable rate interest obligations with respect to the lesser of a million and b of the average amount of the unpaid loans outstanding during the prior month  and to maintain the following financial coverage ratios our consolidated net worth at any time cannot be less than million plus of all net income earned in a calendar quarter  without deduction for any quarterly losses  plus of the proceeds of any equity offering  at the end of any fiscal quarter  our debt to ebitda ratio cannot be more than to through december  and to thereafter  
table of contents at the end of each fiscal quarter  our cash flow coverage ratio cannot be less than to 
as of june   we were in compliance with all of our covenants under our existing credit agreement 
the payment and performance of our obligations under the existing credit agreement and the documents ancillary thereto are secured by liens on all or substantially all of our and its subsidiaries other than ace funding  llc s assets 
all of our subsidiaries other than ace funding  llc guaranteed our obligations under the existing credit agreement 
the collateral arrangements entered into by us and our guarantor subsidiaries are substantially similar for each of wells fargo bank  as administrative agent for the lenders  and travelers express company  inc  which has a subordinate lien to secure the payment and performance of our obligations under the money order agreement and under the moneygram agreement 
we and all of our secured creditors or agents for them entered into a first amended and restated intercreditor agreement dated as of july  that includes agreements regarding the priority of distributions to the lenders and travelers express upon foreclosure and liquidation of the collateral subject to the security agreements executed by us and our guarantor subsidiaries and certain other intercreditor arrangements 
this intercreditor agreement replaced the intercreditor agreement dated as of march   as amended  that was in effect with our prior credit agreement 
fiscal credit facilities during the year ended june   we were party to a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks led by wells fargo bank texas  national association  as administrative agent for itself and other lenders  that provided for revolving credit facilities of up to million  and a note purchase agreement with american capital financial services  inc  as agent for its affiliate american capital strategies  ltd  in the amount of million of our senior subordinated secured promissory notes 
the terms of those agreements are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as described above  the bank credit agreement was amended and restated on july   and the notes issued to american capital strategies  ltd 
were fully repaid in may as of june   we had borrowed million under our revolving line of credit facility 
the average amount borrowed on our revolving line of credit facility was million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the prime rate effective on june  was and libor effective on that date was 
swap agreements to reduce our risk of greater interest expense because of interest rate fluctuations  we enter into interest rate swap agreements from time to time  which effectively convert a portion of our floating rate interest obligations to fixed rate interest obligations 
on april   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with jp morgan chase bank  regarding a notional amount of million  associated with the revolving advance facility under our bank credit agreement  to be effective until march  on may   the notional amount was reduced from million to million and increased to million on january  on april   the interest rate swap agreement was amended to reduce the notional amount to million and extend the effective date from march  to september  the fixed rate effective on june   prior to adding the applicable margin  was on june   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with national city bank regarding a notional amount of million  corresponding to our term notes  to be effective until march  in may  we paid the notes in full and terminated the swap agreement 
there was no material gain or loss recorded as a result of the swap termination 
self service machine funding arrangements we placed of our self service check cashing machines in certain retail offices of h r block tax services  inc during the tax season 
in accordance with our existing multi year license agreement with h r block  the self service machines were available to cash only tax refund checks and tax refund anticipation loan checks of h r block customers 
h r block is entitled to a portion of the tax fees collected varying by level of fees collected 
our agreement with h r block has a term through july   and will automatically renew for one year periods thereafter absent days prior notice to terminate by either of the parties 
either party may terminate the agreement at an earlier date if the non terminating party i fails to timely cure a default under the agreement or ii is bankrupt or insolvent 

table of contents we reduced the number of self service machines in h r block offices to during the fiscal tax season from in fiscal  thereby reducing our cash required to fund the machines 
in fiscal  we only utilized the dz bank funding of million for the self service machines placed in the h r block retail offices through an arrangement with ace funding llc  our wholly owned subsidiary  as borrower  and dz bank ag deutsche zentral genossenschaftsbank frankfurt am main  a german bank  as arranger and liquidity agent  and autobahn funding company llc  as lender 
this funding arrangement extends through the tax season 
we expect to have this or a similar type of funding in place in the future 
if this type of financing were not available  we would need to evaluate the continuation of this service offering 
for financial reporting purposes  ace funding is our consolidated subsidiary and all borrowings by ace funding under this arrangement  all amounts paid by ace funding under this arrangement and all check cashing fees received by us from the self service machines subject to this arrangement are and will be reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
all borrowings under this arrangement for the tax season were repaid in full by march  the revenue and contribution to profit from this specific operation does not have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the tax revenue generated from and self service machines for the year ended june  and was million and million  respectively 
effects of financing arrangements we believe that our long term credit facilities under the existing credit agreement  our funding arrangements for the self service machines in h r block offices during the tax season and our anticipated cash flows from operations will provide adequate working capital for our operations 
although the credit agreement places restrictions on capital expenditures and acquisitions  we believe that these restrictions do not prohibit us from pursuing our growth strategy as currently planned 
stock repurchase program in fiscal  our board of directors authorized up to million for the repurchase of shares of our common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions 
during fiscal and  we repurchased  shares at an average price of per share 
during fiscal   and  no shares were repurchased 
in may  our board of directors terminated the previous repurchase program and established a new program authorizing up to million for the repurchase of common stock in the open market or negotiated transactions 
since then  no shares have been repurchased 
the repurchase program does not have an expiration date  but will terminate when we have made all of the authorized repurchases or earlier by our board of directors 
litigation expenses we have been required in the past to defend ourselves and  in some matters  our directors  officers and others in various lawsuits and state regulatory proceedings regarding our current and past loan related activities 
we incurred significant legal expenses in conducting that defense 
in accordance with our bylaws  we paid the expenses of defense for our directors  officers and other employees named as additional defendants in these lawsuits 
seasonality our business is seasonal to the extent of the impact of cashing tax refund checks and tax refund anticipation loan checks 
the impact of these services is in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year 
our loan business declines slightly in the third fiscal quarter as a result of the customers receipt of tax refund checks and tax refund anticipation loans 
impact of inflation we believe that our results of operations are not dependent upon the levels of inflation 
liquidity outlook based on our current level of operations and anticipated revenue growth  we believe our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowings under our credit facilities will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next months 
however  we have substantial working capital needs  contractual commitments and debt service obligations 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  that our anticipated revenue growth will be realized or that future borrowings will be available to us under credit facilities in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our existing indebtedness or fund our other liquidity needs 
in addition  if we undertake expansion efforts in the future  our cash requirements may increase significantly 

table of contents forward looking statements this report contains  and from time to time we or certain of our representatives may make  forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended

those risks  uncertainties  and other factors could cause the actual results to differ materially from these in the forward looking statements 
those factors are described under risk factors below 
we expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any of these forward looking statements  whether because of future events  new information  a change in our views or expectations  or otherwise 
we make no prediction or statement about the performance of our common stock 
risk factors our current business and future results may be affected by a number of risks and uncertainties  including those described below 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition could suffer 
the risks discussed below also include forward looking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
we have significant existing debt and the restrictive covenants under our debt agreements may limit our ability to expand or pursue our business strategy 
in addition  if we are forced to pay some or all of this debt following an event of default  our financial condition and results of operations would be severely and adversely affected 
our business requires significant amounts of cash for services and inventory 
much of that cash is obtained through borrowing 
therefore  we have  and we expect to have  a significant amount of outstanding debt and may incur additional debt in the future as we seek to expand our business 
as of june   our short term debt was million  and we had no material long term debt 
our debt agreements require us to maintain compliance with numerous financial covenants 
the covenants restrict our ability to take certain actions to some extent  including our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends and make distributions in respect of our capital stock  repurchase our capital stock  make capital expenditures  make investments or other restricted payments  engage in transactions with shareholders and affiliates  create liens  sell or otherwise dispose of assets  make payments on our debt  other than in the ordinary course  and engage in mergers and acquisitions 
as long as our indebtedness remains outstanding  the restrictive covenants could impair our ability to expand or pursue our growth strategy 
in addition  the breach of any covenants or any payment obligations in any of these debt agreements will result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument 
if there is an event of default under one of our debt agreements  the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable  subject to applicable grace periods 
this could trigger cross defaults under our other debt agreements 
we cannot 
table of contents assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to repay fully borrowings under our outstanding debt agreements if accelerated upon an event of default  or that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on any of those debt agreements 
further  if we are unable to repay  refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our secured debt agreements  the lenders under such agreements could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness 
substantially all of our assets are pledged to secure the outstanding indebtedness 
forced repayment of some or all of our indebtedness would reduce our available cash and have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our existing and future debt obligations could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition as we may be required to secure additional financing to meet our future capital needs and cannot assure you that we will be able to do so on favorable terms  if at all 
our significant amount of debt could have important consequences 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to the holders of our outstanding debt  make us vulnerable to interest rate increases  because a significant portion of our borrowings is  and will continue to be  at variable rates of interest  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt obligations  which will reduce our funds available for working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate expenses  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have proportionately less debt  restrict our operational flexibility  because of restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to make acquisitions  explore certain business opportunities  dispose of assets and take other actions  and limit our ability to borrow additional funds in the future  if we need them  due to applicable financial and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements 
if our debt levels increase  the related risks that we face will also increase 
if we fail to generate sufficient cash flow from future operations to meet our debt service obligations  we may need to seek refinancing of all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations with respect to our indebtedness 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms or at all  particularly because of our high levels of debt and the debt incurrence restrictions imposed by our current debt agreements 
if we do not generate a sufficient amount of cash  which depends on many factors beyond our control  our liquidity and our ability to service our indebtedness and fund our operations would be harmed 
based on our current level of operations and anticipated revenue growth  we believe our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowings under our credit facilities will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs 
however  we have substantial working capital needs  contractual commitments and debt service obligations 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  that our anticipated revenue growth will be realized or that future borrowings will be available to us under credit facilities in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our existing indebtedness or fund our other liquidity needs 
in addition  if we undertake expansion efforts in the future  our cash requirements may increase significantly 
the industry in which we operate is strictly regulated at both the federal and state level 
changes in current laws and regulations  or the application of future laws and regulations  may have a significant negative impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our business is subject to numerous state and certain federal laws and regulations which are subject to change and which may impose significant costs or limitations on the way we conduct or expand our business 
these regulations govern or affect  among other things check cashing fees  licensing and posting of fees  lending practices  such as truth in lending  
table of contents interest rates and usury  currency reporting  recording and reporting of certain financial transactions  franchising in the states in which we offer and sell franchises  privacy of personal consumer information  and prompt remittance of proceeds for the sale of money orders 
as we develop new services  we may become subject to additional federal and state regulations 
in addition  changes in current laws and future laws or regulations may restrict our ability to continue our current methods of operation or expand our operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
states may also seek to impose new licensing requirements or interpret or enforce existing requirements in new ways 
short term consumer loan services have come under increased scrutiny and regulation 
if the restrictions created by such regulations increase  or if short term consumer loans become prohibited in the states where we offer these loans  our business would be materially adversely affected 
a significant portion of our revenues is based on loan interest and fees from short term consumer loans  also known as payday loans  that we offer in our company owned stores 
short term consumer loans have come under increased scrutiny and regulation in recent years 
legislation has been introduced in the united states congress and in certain state legislatures  and regulatory authorities have proposed or publicly addressed the possibility of proposing regulations  that may prohibit or severely restrict short term consumer loans 
for example  in december  we ceased offering short term consumer loans at our stores in alabama  georgia and north carolina as a result of laws enacted restricting short term consumer loans in those states 
as a result of more recently enacted laws in alabama permitting short term consumer loans  we resumed offering short term consumer loans at our company owned store in that state in july  we intend to continue  with others in the short term consumer loan industry  to inform and educate legislators and to oppose legislative or regulatory action that may prohibit or severely restrict short term consumer loans 
nevertheless  if legislative or regulatory action with that effect were taken on the federal level or in states in which we have a significant number of stores  that action may have a material adverse effect on our loan related activities and revenues 
moreover  similar action by states in which we are not currently offering short term consumer loans could result in us having fewer opportunities to pursue our growth strategy 
in  the office of the comptroller of the currency  which supervises national banks  took action to effectively prohibit certain national banks from offering and making short term consumer loans because of the agency s view that they posed various risks to those banks 
as a result  we discontinued offering goleta loans in our stores on december  in addition  republic bank trust company  a kentucky state chartered bank  and first bank of delaware  for each of which we act as marketer and servicer of their loans  are subject to federal and state banking regulations 
the states of kentucky and delaware are the primary regulators for republic bank and first bank of delaware  respectively  and the federal deposit insurance corporation  or fdic  is the back up federal regulator of each bank 
the fdic issued guidelines governing permissible arrangements between a state chartered bank and a marketer and servicer of its short term loans  also referred to as payday loans  in july  and issued revised guidelines in march the guidelines apply to our marketing and servicing agreements with republic bank  for which we offer a shorter term currently day  single installment loan  and first bank of delaware  for which we offer a longer term currently week  multi installment loan  regarding the offering of each such bank s loans at our stores in arkansas  pennsylvania and texas and our servicing activities regarding those loans 
the guidelines describe the fdic s expectations for a bank s prudent risk management practices regarding payday loan marketing and servicing relationships 
they address bank capital requirements  allowances for loan losses and loan classifications as well as income recognition  collection recovery practices and compliance with consumer protection laws when a bank engages in payday lending 
the revised fdic guidelines issued in march include a requirement that banks such as republic bank and first bank of delaware develop procedures to ensure that a payday loan is not provided to any customer with payday loans from any lender for more than three months in the previous months 
assuming an average term of approximately days  this limits the number of payday loans a customer may have from all lenders during any month period to six 
the revised fdic guidelines also suggest that supervised lenders should offer a customer subject to such a limitation  or refer such a customer to  a longer term loan product 
in response to the revised fdic guidelines  customers at our stores in texas  pennsylvania and arkansas who are denied a shorter term republic bank loan  may apply for a longer term first bank of 
table of contents delaware installment loan 
it is unclear at this time what procedures and or alternate products the fdic may accept as conforming with the revised guidelines 
if the implementation and enforcement of the revised fdic guidelines or any newly promulgated guidelines by the fdic  or any order  law  rule or regulation by the states of kentucky or delaware or the fdic  were to have the effect of significantly curtailing either republic bank s short term consumer lending services or first bank of delaware s installment lending services  our revenues derived from fees from republic bank or first bank of delaware would be materially adversely affected  unless we could offer  or we could secure an agreement with another financial institution not subject to such limitations to offer  similar or alternate services 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in offering similar or alternate services or finding such a replacement financial institution  in the latter case especially because arrangements like ours with republic bank and first bank of delaware are coming under increasing political and regulatory scrutiny 
lawsuits filed against banks offering short term consumer loans  such as one filed by the new york state attorney general s office in september discussed below  may hinder our ability to partner with a replacement bank or to establish relationships with new banks in other states as part of our growth strategy 
any alternate or similar services or agreement with a replacement bank or new bank may also not be on terms as favorable to us as our current agreements with republic bank and first bank of delaware 
each of republic bank and first bank of delaware is also subject to fdic inspection and authority  and as a result of our marketing and servicing activities  we too are subject to such inspection and authority 
we cannot assure you that the regulatory scheme affecting republic bank or first bank of delaware  or fdic inspection or authority with respect to republic bank  first bank of delaware or us  will not negatively impact our operations 
potential litigation and regulatory proceedings regarding our consumer loans could materially adversely affect our financial condition 
during the last few years  we and our competitors have been subject to regulatory proceedings  class action lawsuits and other litigation regarding the offering of consumer loans  particularly those with a shorter term 
in our case  such litigation and regulatory proceedings primarily involved attempts by plaintiffs to recharacterize us as the true lender of short term consumer loans made by goleta national bank through our stores  in part because we acquired participations in the goleta loans 
although our relationship with goleta has been terminated and we have settled the related class action lawsuit  we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to future lawsuits associated with our consumer loan services 
in particular  we may become subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings focusing on our relationship with either republic bank or first bank of delaware 
if we were to be recharacterized as the lender of the republic bank loans or the first bank of delaware loans  then the interest charged for these loans would violate most of the applicable states usury laws which impose maximum rates of interest or finance charges that a non bank lender may charge  and any resulting refunds or penalties we would likely incur would materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
while there are differences between the goleta loans and each of the republic bank loans and first bank of delaware loans  principally that we do not acquire participations in republic bank loans or first bank of delaware loans  and while we believe we are not the lender under either of our arrangements with republic bank or first bank of delaware  we cannot assure you that a regulator or a borrower will not try to recharacterize us as the true lender 
for example  although we do not offer short term consumer loans in new york  in september the new york state attorney general s office filed a lawsuit against a delaware state chartered bank and the companies servicing its short term consumer loans through a structure that is in some respects similar to our agreements with republic bank and first bank of delaware 
media reports and public perception of short term consumer loans as being predatory or abusive could materially adversely affect our business 
over the past few years  consumer advocacy groups and certain media reports have advocated governmental action to prohibit or severely restrict consumer loans  particularly those with a shorter term 
the consumer groups and media reports typically focus on the cost to a consumer for this type of loan  which is higher than the interest typically charged by credit card issuers to a more creditworthy consumer 
this difference in credit cost is more significant if a consumer does not promptly repay the loan  but renews  or rolls over  that loan for one or more additional short term periods 
the consumer groups and media reports typically characterize these short term consumer loans as predatory or abusive toward consumers 
if this negative characterization of our short term consumer loan service becomes increasingly accepted by consumers  demand for our short term consumer loans could significantly decrease  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
negative perception of our short term consumer loans or other activities could also result in us being subject to more restrictive laws and regulations 
for example  a short term consumer loan prohibition law was recently passed by the georgia state legislature 
in addition  we may become subject to lawsuits against us for loans we make  or loans we offer made by republic bank or first bank of delaware 
if changes in the laws affecting any of our short term consumer loans  the 
table of contents republic bank loans or the first bank of delaware loans are enacted  or if we become subject to such lawsuits  our financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
if our estimates of our loan losses are not adequate to absorb known or probable losses  our financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses at levels to cover the anticipated losses in the collection of the portfolio of loans that we make 
we determine our allowance for loan losses based upon a review of historical loan losses and the loan portfolio 
our allowance for loan losses is periodically reviewed by our management 
for the fiscal year ended june   our loan loss provision was million  and we charged off million related to our loans 
our loan loss provision  however  is an estimate  and if actual loan losses are materially greater than our loan loss provision  our financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
with respect to the republic bank loans and first bank of delaware loans  we are obligated to reimburse each bank for all loan losses 
as a result  we could be potentially obligated to pay each of republic bank and first bank of delaware for loan losses in an amount up to the total outstanding amount of loans made by each such bank as recorded on their respective financial statements 
we commenced offering first bank of delaware loans on august  with respect to republic bank loans  republic bank s financial statements reflect a total outstanding amount of million as of june  this amount is not included on our balance sheet 
for the fiscal year ended june   we provided a payable of approximately million for losses on republic bank loans and charged off million related to republic bank loans 
the balance of the liability for republic bank loan losses reported in accrued liabilities as of june  was million 
the payable to republic bank is  however  an estimate 
if actual republic bank loan losses are materially greater than our recorded amount payable to republic bank  our financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
a significant portion of our consumer lending business is derived from our relationships with republic bank and first bank of delaware  and a loss of either relationship could adversely affect our liquidity and profits 
under our marketing and servicing agreements with each of republic bank and first bank of delaware  we provide various services to such banks in connection with our marketing and servicing of their loans in exchange for which we receive a portion of the interest  and in the case of first bank of delaware  a portion of certain other fees  collected from borrowers 
as of august   each of republic bank and first bank of delaware was offering its loans in of our company owned stores in texas  pennsylvania and arkansas 
approximately of our total revenues in the twelve months ended june  was derived from fees paid to us by republic bank

the term of our agreement with first bank of delaware expires july   and will renew for an additional months unless either party elects to terminate it as of july  by providing at least days notice to the other party before that date 
the agreement may be terminated before its scheduled expiration i automatically if either party seeks protection under any federal or state bankruptcy  insolvency  receivership  or similar law  ii automatically if first bank of delaware is placed into conservatorship or receivership with the fdic or other authority  iii automatically if an involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency petition is filed against us and not dismissed within days of that filing or a receiver or any regulatory authority takes control of us  iv by either party if the other party commits a material breach of  or other specified default under  the agreement and fails to cure such breach or default within days of notice  v by first bank of delaware  upon days notice  if first bank of delaware becomes aware of any adverse legal  regulatory  or other developments that could have a material adverse impact on first bank of delaware  the profitability of its activities under the agreement  or its litigation or risk exposure  vi by us  upon days notice  if first bank of delaware changes its loan related policies in a manner that is reasonably likely to have  or if we become aware of any adverse legal  regulatory  or other developments that could have  a material adverse impact on us  the profitability of our activities under the agreement  or our litigation or risk 
table of contents exposure  or vii by us  upon days notice  if we determine that we can profitably engage in installment loan or deferred deposit transactions in texas independent of first bank of delaware  except that upon any termination for this reason on or before december   we must pay first bank of delaware a termination fee of  the fdic has set limits on the dollar amount of short term consumer loans that either republic bank or first bank of delaware can have outstanding at any given time based on its capital 
in addition  the revised guidelines for short term  also referred to as payday  lending issued by the fdic in march include a requirement that banks such as republic bank and first bank of delaware develop procedures to ensure that a payday loan is not provided to any customer with payday loans from any lender for more than months in the previous months 
if the fdic were to reduce the limits on the dollar amount of short term consumer loans or installment loans that either republic bank or first bank of delaware can have outstanding at any time  further limit the number of short term  payday loans a borrower may have outstanding  or characterize the longer term installment loans made by first bank of delaware as a payday loan  or any other events involving either republic bank or first bank of delaware outside of our control were to occur  our ability to grow this portion of our business could be materially adversely affected 
if a termination of or significant adverse change in our relationship with either republic bank or first bank of delaware occurred  we could be required to seek replacement relationships with new financial institutions 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to secure new relationships or that the terms of any such new relationships would be as favorable to us as those of our existing relationship with republic bank and first bank of delaware 
as a result  any significant changes in our relationship with either republic bank or first bank of delaware could cause us to change the way we conduct business in certain states or adversely affect our results of operations 
if the loan approval process for either republic bank or first bank of delaware is flawed and more loans go uncollected  our revenues could be materially adversely affected 
our agreements with republic bank and first bank of delaware provide for us to market and service loans offered by each such bank at our company owned stores in texas  pennsylvania and arkansas 
each of the banks is responsible for reviewing each loan application and determining whether such application is approved for a loan 
we are not involved in the loan approval process  including with respect to determining the loan approval procedures or criteria 
however  under each of our agreements with republic bank and first bank of delaware  we are required to reimburse the bank for loan losses 
if either bank s loan approval process is flawed and an increased number of loans that are made are uncollected  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we are subject to franchise law and regulations that govern our status as a franchisor and regulate some aspects of our franchise relationships 
our ability to develop new franchised stores and to enforce contractual rights against franchisees may be adversely affected by these laws and regulations  which could cause our franchise revenues to decline and adversely affect our growth strategy 
we are subject to federal and state laws and regulations  including the regulations of the federal trade commission as well as similar authorities in individual states  in connection with the offer  sale and termination of franchises and the regulation of the franchisor franchisee relationship 
our failure to comply with these laws could subject us to liability to franchisees and to fines or other penalties imposed by governmental authorities 
in addition  we may become subject to litigation with  or other claims filed with state or federal authorities by  franchisees based on alleged unfair trade practices  implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing  payment of royalties  location of stores  advertising expenditures  franchise renewal criteria or express violations of franchise agreements 
we cannot assure you that we will not encounter compliance problems from time to time or that material disputes will not arise with one or more franchisees 
accordingly  our failure to comply with applicable franchise laws and regulations  or disputes with franchisees  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and growth strategy 
our current and future business growth strategy involves new store acquisitions and new store openings  and our failure to manage our growth or integrate or manage new store acquisitions may adversely affect our business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
our expansion strategy consists principally of combining acquisitions and new store openings both company owned and franchised stores and increasing comparable store sales of existing services 
acquisitions may entail numerous integration risks and impose costs on us  including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations or services  including the loss of key employees from acquired businesses  diversion of management s attention from our core business  
table of contents dilutive issuances of our equity securities if necessary to finance acquisitions or new stores  incurrence of additional indebtedness if necessary to finance acquisitions or new stores  assumption of contingent liabilities  the potential impairment of acquired assets  and incurrence of significant immediate write offs 
our continued growth is dependent upon a number of factors  including the availability of adequate financing and suitable store locations  acquisition opportunities and experienced management employees  the ability to obtain any required government permits and licenses and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to grow our business successfully through acquisitions and new store openings 
our failure to grow or complete the integration of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
if we lose key management or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business  our operating results and growth could suffer 
our future success depends to a significant degree upon the members of our senior management  particularly jay shipowitz  our president and chief executive officer 
the loss of the services of mr 
shipowitz or other members of senior management could harm our business and development 
our continued growth also will depend upon our ability to attract and retain additional skilled management personnel 
if we are unable to attract and retain personnel as needed in the future  our operating results and growth could suffer 
competition in the retail financial services industry is intense and could cause us to lose market share and revenues 
the industry in which we operate is highly fragmented and very competitive 
in addition  we believe that the market will become more competitive as the industry matures and consolidates 
we compete with other check cashing stores  short term consumer lenders  grocery stores  banks  savings and loan institutions  other financial services entities and other retail businesses that also cash checks  offer short term consumer loans  sell money orders  provide money transfer services  or other similar financial services 
some of our competitors that are not check cashing companies have larger and more established customer bases and substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources 
our stores also face competition from automated check cashing machines deployed in supermarkets  convenience stores and other public venues by large financial services organizations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully 
as a result  we could lose market share and our revenues could decline  thereby affecting our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to service our indebtedness and fund our operations 
our revenues and net income from check cashing services may be materially adversely affected if the number of consumer check cashing transactions decreases or the amount of checks we cash that are uncollected significantly increases 
historically  over half of our revenues come from our check cashing business 
any changes in economic factors that materially adversely affect consumer transactions could reduce the volume of transactions that we process and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
recently  there has been increasing penetration of electronic banking services into the check cashing and money transfer industry  including direct deposit of payroll checks and electronic transfer of government benefits 
to the extent that checks are replaced with such electronic transfers  demand for our check cashing services could decrease 
in addition  the risk that we assume upon cashing a check is that the check will be uncollected because of insufficient funds  stop payment orders  or fraud 
if the amount of checks we cash that are uncollected increases significantly  our net income will be materially adversely affected 
our money transfer and money order revenues are derived from a key third party relationship and a loss of that relationship could adversely affect our liquidity and profits 
we are a party to a money order agreement with travelers express under which we exclusively sell travelers express money orders that bear our logo 
under this agreement  we are obligated to make prompt remittances of money order proceeds 
we are also an agent for the receipt and transmission of wire transfers of money through the moneygram network 
table of contents in accordance with an agreement with travelers express and moneygram payment systems  inc  an affiliate of travelers express 
approximately of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended june  were derived from these agreements 
our relationship with travelers express and its affiliates is therefore significant to our business 
accordingly  if any disruption in this relationship occurs  it could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and profits 
any disruption in the availability of our information systems could adversely affect operations at our stores 
our information systems include a proprietary point of sale system in our stores and a management information system 
the personal computer based point of sale system is fully operational in all company owned stores  is used by our self service machines for cashing checks and accepting third party bill payments and is licensed for use by our franchised stores 
the management information system is designed to provide summary and detailed information to district managers  regional vice presidents and corporate managers at any time through internet connectivity 
any disruption in the availability of our information systems could affect our operations and could adversely affect our business 
part of our business is seasonal  which causes our revenues to fluctuate and may adversely affect our ability to service our debt 
our business is seasonal to the extent of the impact of cashing tax refund checks and tax refund anticipation loan checks 
the impact of these services is primarily in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year 
also  our consumer loan business declines slightly in the third fiscal quarter as a result of customers receipt of tax refund checks and tax refund anticipation loans 
this seasonality requires us to manage our cash flows over the course of the year 
if our revenues were to fall substantially below what we would normally expect during certain periods  our annual financial results would be adversely impacted and our ability to service our debt may also be adversely affected 
because we maintain a significant supply of cash in our stores  we may be subject to cash shortages due to employee error and theft 
since our business requires us to maintain a significant supply of cash in each of our stores and during tax season each of our self service machines  we are subject to the risk of cash shortages resulting from employee errors and theft 
although we have implemented various procedures and programs to reduce these risks  maintain insurance coverage for theft and provide security for our employees and facilities  we cannot assure you that employee error and theft will not occur 
material occurrences of error and theft could lead to cash shortages and could adversely affect our results of operations 
the price of our common stock may be volatile 
in the past three years  stocks listed on the nasdaq national market  as our common stock is  have experienced high levels of volatility and significant declines in value from their historic highs 
the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated  and may continue to fluctuate  substantially from time to time 
the fluctuations could cause you to lose part or all of your investment in our shares of common stock 
those factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include  but are not limited to  the following price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time  significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of financial services companies  actual or anticipated changes in our earnings or fluctuations in our operating results or in the expectations of securities analysts  general economic conditions and trends  major catastrophic events  loss of a significant client or clients  sales of large blocks of our stock  or departures of key personnel 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
due to the potential volatility of our stock price  we may therefore be the target of securities litigation in the future 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources from our business 

table of contents insiders have substantial control over us and could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions  including a change of control 
as of june   our principal shareholders  directors and executive officers  and entities affiliated with them  owned approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
as a result  these shareholders  if acting together  are able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers  acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions 
they may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests 
the concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  preventing or deterring a change of control of our company  could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium of their common stock as a party of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock 
our operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions  which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 
our operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions  which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 
for example  in august  certain of our stores in the new orleans and baton rouge area were closed for varying periods as a result of hurricane katrina 
in addition  the occurrence and threat of terrorist attacks may directly or indirectly affect economic conditions  which could in turn adversely affect demand for our services 
in the event of a major natural or manmade disaster  we could experience loss of life of our employees  destruction of facilities or business interruptions  any of which could materially adversely affect us 
more generally  any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the united states economy and worldwide financial markets 
any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on us and also may result in volatility of the market price for our securities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  particularly including changes in interest rates that might affect the costs of our financing under our existing credit agreement 
to mitigate the risks of changes in interest rates  we use derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
to reduce our risk of greater interest expense because of interest rate fluctuations  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements  which effectively converted a portion of our floating rate interest obligations to fixed rate interest obligations  as described in note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of our existing interest rate swaps was  as of june  the associated underlying debt has equaled or exceeded the notional amount for each swap throughout the existence of the swap  and we anticipate that it will continue to do so 
each existing swap is based on the same index as  and repriced on a consistent basis with its corresponding underlying debt
