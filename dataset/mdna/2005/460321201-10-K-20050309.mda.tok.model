such statements include  without limitation  statements regarding estimated fair values of capital assets  the recoverability of the cost of those assets  the estimated future cash flows attributable to those assets  and the appropriate discounts to be applied in determining the net present values of those estimated cash flows  estimated scrap values of assets held for disposal  estimated fair values of financial instruments  such as interest rate and commodity swap agreements  estimated losses including independent actuarial estimates under self insurance arrangements  as well as estimated losses on certain contracts  trade routes  lines of business or asset dispositions  estimated losses attributable to asbestos claims  estimated obligations  and the timing thereof  to the us customs service relating to foreign repair work  the adequacy of our capital resources and the availability of additional capital resources on commercially acceptable terms  our ability to remain in compliance with our debt covenants  anticipated trends in government sponsored cargoes  our ability to maintain or increase our government subsidies  the anticipated improvement in the results of our rail ferry service  the estimated effect on our results of operations of the american jobs creation act of  and assumptions underlying any of the foregoing 
forward looking statements may include the words may  will  estimate  intend  continue  believe  expect  plan or anticipate and other similar words 
although we believe that the expectations expressed in our forward looking statements are reasonable  actual results could differ from those projected or assumed in our forward looking statements  and those variations could be material 
our future financial condition and results of operations  as well as any forward looking statements  are subject to change and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties 
important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations may include  without limitation  our ability to i identify customers with marine transportation needs requiring specialized vessels or operating techniques  ii secure financing on satisfactory terms to acquire  modify  or construct vessels if such financing is necessary to service the potential needs of current or future customers  iii obtain new contracts or renew existing contracts which would employ certain of our vessels or other assets upon the expiration of contracts currently in place  on favorable economic terms  iv manage the amount and rate of growth of our general and administrative expenses and costs associated with operating certain of our vessels  v and manage our growth in terms of implementing internal controls and information systems and hiring or retaining key personnel  among other things 
other factors include vi changes in cargo  charterhire  fuel  and vessel utilization rates which could increase or decrease our gross voyage profit from our liner services  vii the rate at which competitors add or scrap vessels in the markets in which we operate  viii changes in interest rates which could increase or decrease the amount of interest we incur on borrowings with variable rates of interest  and the availability and cost of capital to us  ix the impact on our financial statements of nonrecurring accounting charges that may result from our ongoing evaluation of business strategies  asset valuations  and organizational structures  x changes in accounting policies and practices adopted voluntarily or as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  xi changes in laws and regulations such as those related to government assistance programs and tax rates  xii the frequency and severity of claims against us  and unanticipated outcomes of current or possible future legal proceedings  xiii unplanned maintenance and out of service days on our vessels  xiv the ability of customers to fulfill obligations with us  xv the performance of unconsolidated subsidiaries  xvi our ability to effectively handle our substantial leverage by servicing and meeting the covenant requirements in each of our debt instruments  thereby avoiding any defaults under those instruments and avoiding cross defaults under others  and xvii other economic  competitive  governmental  and technological factors which may affect our operations 
we caution readers that we assume no obligation to update or publicly release any revisions to forward looking statements made in this report or elsewhere by us or on our behalf 
critical accounting policies set forth below is a discussion of the accounting policies and related estimates that we believe are the most critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements  financial condition  and results of operations and which require complex management judgments  uncertainties and or estimates 
information regarding our other accounting policies is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
voyage revenue and expense recognition revenues and expenses relating to our liner and rail ferry segments voyages are recorded over the duration of the voyage 
revenues and expenses relating to our other segments voyages  which require no estimates or assumptions  are recorded when earned or incurred during the reporting period 
on our liner services  the voyage revenues are known at the beginning of the vessel s voyage and are reported through the date of the financial statements based on the relative transit time  which is the time between the vessel s loading port to the vessel s discharge port 
variances from initial revenue estimates are generally not material 
voyage expenditures are estimated at the beginning of the vessel s voyage based on historical cost standards and current estimates received from our vendors and port agents 
provisions for loss voyages are recorded when contracts for the voyages are fixed and when losses become apparent for voyages in progress 
during the course of the vessel s voyage  typically to days  actual costs replace the original estimates and become part of the historical cost standards 
because of our on going voyage review process  all variances from our original revenue and expense estimates are reported timely and generally are not material or recurring 
depreciation provisions for depreciation are computed on the straight line method based on estimated useful lives of our depreciable assets 
various methods are used to estimate the useful lives and salvage values of our depreciable assets and due to the capital intensive nature of our business and our large base of depreciable assets  changes in such estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations 
drydocking costs we defer certain costs related to the drydocking of our vessels 
deferred drydocking costs are capitalized as incurred and amortized on a straight line basis over the period between drydockings generally two to five years 
because drydocking charges can be material in any one period  we believe that the acceptable deferred method provides a better matching for the amortization of those costs over future revenue periods benefiting from the drydocking of our vessel 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
provisions for income taxes include deferred income taxes that are provided on items of income and expense  which affect taxable income in one period and financial income in another 
certain foreign operations are not subject to income taxation under pertinent provisions of the laws of the country of incorporation or operation 
in december of  we made an election under the jobs creation act to have our us flag operations other than those of two ineligible vessels used exclusively in united states coastwise commerce taxed under a new tonnage tax regime rather than under the usual us corporate income tax regime effective january  under the jobs creation act  the taxable income from the shipping operations of our cfcs will generally no longer be subject to current united states income tax but will be deferred until repatriated 
as a result  our effective tax rate and tax provisions will be materially lower in future years 
self retention insurance we maintain provisions for estimated losses under our self retention insurance based on estimates of the eventual claims settlement costs 
our policy is to establish self insurance provisions for each policy year based on independent actuarial estimates  and to maintain the provisions at those levels for the estimated run off period  approximately two years from the inception of that period 
we believe most claims will be reported  or estimates for existing claims will be revised  within this two year period 
subsequent to this two year period  self insurance provisions are adjusted to reflect our current estimate of loss exposure for the policy year 
our estimates are determined based on various factors  such as severity of the injury for personal injuries and estimated potential liability based on past judgments and settlements  advice from legal counsel based on its assessment of the facts of the case and its experience in other cases  probability of pre trial settlement which would mitigate legal costs  historical experience on claims for each specific type of cargo for cargo damage claims  and whether our seamen are employed in permanent positions or temporary revolving positions 
it is reasonably possible that changes in our estimated exposure may occur from time to time 
however  if during this two year period our estimate of loss exposure exceeds the actuarial estimate  then additional loss provisions are recorded to increase the self insurance provisions to our estimate of the eventual claims settlement cost 
the measurement of our exposure for self insurance liability requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of loss provisions recorded during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
asbestos claims we maintain provisions for estimated losses for asbestos claims based on estimates of eventual claims settlement costs 
our policy is to establish provisions based on a range of estimated exposure 
we estimate this potential range of exposure using input from legal counsel and internal estimates based on the individual deductible levels for each policy year 
we are also indemnified for certain of these claims by the previous owner of one of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the measurement of our exposure for asbestos liability requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of the loss provisions recorded during the period 
our estimates and assumptions are formed from variables such as the maximum deductible levels in a claim year  the amount of the indemnification recovery and the claimant s employment history with the company 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
pension and postretirement benefits our pension and postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  inflation  rate of compensation increases  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our outside actuary and information as to historical experience and performance 
differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and postretirement obligations and future expense 
results of operations our vessels are operated under a variety of charters and contracts 
the nature of these arrangements is such that  without a material variation in gross voyage profits total revenues less voyage expenses and vessel and barge depreciation  the revenues and expenses attributable to a vessel deployed under one type of charter or contract can differ substantially from those attributable to the same vessel if deployed under a different type of charter or contract 
accordingly  depending on the mix of charters or contracts in place during a particular accounting period  our revenues and expenses can fluctuate substantially from one period to another even though the number of vessels deployed  the number of voyages completed  the amount of cargo carried  and the gross voyage profit derived from the vessels remain relatively constant 
as a result  fluctuations in voyage revenues and expenses are not necessarily indicative of trends in profitability  and our management believes that gross voyage profit is a more appropriate measure of operating performance than revenues 
accordingly  the discussion below addresses variations in gross voyage profits rather than variations in revenues 
executive summary the company s results for the twelve months ended december  showed net income of million compared to net income of million for the same period of included in the results is an addition to net income of million resulting from the enactment  in the fourth quarter  of the jobs creation act 
the company elected  under the jobs creation act  for its qualified domestic operations to be treated under a notional tax see item business new tax legislation on page for further explanation  which rendered certain net preferred tax provisions booked in prior years unnecessary 
in and the fourth quarter  in particular  was eventful for the company 
in october  the company s seven vessels participating in the msp were extended in the program through september additionally  we learned in january of that we were awarded an eighth msp contract effective in october of we are currently exploring our options to fulfill the contract requirement 
as a result of actions taken by the bankruptcy courts in november of  our us flag coal carrier s contract was assumed by virginia power energy marketing  inc  a subsidiary of dominion resources  inc  from our previous charterer  usgen new england  inc usgenne 
the original terms of the contract were maintained 
in the fourth quarter of  the company purchased two used container vessels  which replaced chartered vessels under the company s msp contracts 
during the fourth quarter of  the company concluded its intentions to add a second cargo deck to each of the two vessels operating in the rail ferry service 
the work is expected to be completed in the second half of with only minimal delay to the service 
both the purchase of the container vessels and the projected cost of the rail ferry service addition will be financed by the proceeds of the company s million preferred stock offering  which was completed on january  while these events that took place during the fourth quarter provide a positive momentum into  our earnings reflect inconsistent results within our various segments 
while the results of our liner services did not meet our expectations they did surpass those results posted in we expected  and experienced  improved cargo volumes in both our us flag and foreign flag lash services 
the results of our us flag pctc s were negatively impacted by a lower volume of supplemental cargoes 
the results of our us flag coal carrier suffered as a result of out of service days for upgrade and drydocking work 
our rail ferry service was impacted by weather related delays  higher fuel costs and machinery problems 
prior to committing to the addition of the second decks  these vessels underwent extensive machinery overhauls  and the company believes these machinery maintenance issues have been resolved 
the investment we have made in companies owning capesize bulk carriers and owning and operating cement carriers contributed significant returns in the bullish markets for these types of vessels are expected to continue in year ended december  compared to year ended december  gross voyage profit gross voyage profit decreased from million in to million in the changes associated with each of our segments are discussed below 
liner service gross voyage results for this segment improved from a loss of million in to a loss of million in the improvement was primarily a result of higher cargo volumes in compared to for both our us flag lash liner service and foreign flag lash liner service resulting primarily from the repeal of steel tariffs which increased inbound steel tonnage 
additionally  the us flag lash liner service experienced more profitable cargo mix in as compared to time charter contracts the decrease in this segment s gross voyage profit from million in to million in was attributable primarily to our us flag pctcs carrying lower volumes of supplemental cargoes  which provide revenues in addition to those provided by the time charter agreements  during as compared to our us flag pctcs carried lower volumes of supplemental cargoes during the gross voyage profit from our us flag coal carrier was reduced approximately million by an accelerated drydocking due to required repair and upgrade work resulting in sixty four out of service days during contracts of affreightment gross voyage profit for this segment was approximately the same for compared to this segment experienced an increase in cargo volume in but also experienced higher operating costs as a result of machinery deficiencies  which contributed approximately  to the segment s operating costs  and weather delays resulting from hurricanes in the gulf of mexico  which contributed approximately  to the segment s operating costs 
rail ferry service gross voyage loss for this segment increased from a loss of million in to a loss of million in this service experienced higher operating costs due to unanticipated maintenance problems which contributed approximately  to the segment s operating costs  higher fuel costs which contributed approximately  to the segment s operating costs  and weather delays as a result of hurricanes in the gulf of mexico which contributed approximately  to the segment s operating costs 
other gross voyage profit for this segment decreased from million in to million in the decrease resulted primarily from a casualty on one of our vessels that our insurance subsidiary covered for the policy year ended june  other income and expenses in  we had no sales of significant assets 
gain on sale of other assets of million in primarily related to the sale of our multi purpose vessel  which completed its commitment under charter with the msc and was no longer needed for operations  and the sale of special purpose barges no longer needed for current operations 
interest expense decreased from million in to million in decreases due to regularly scheduled payments on outstanding debt accounted for  of the difference 
reduced cost from the early repayment of our senior notes due in  as well as other early debt retirements  accounted for approximately million of the decrease 
investment income decreased from million in to  in primarily as a result of million of dividends received in from our investment in bulk carrier companies accounted for under the cost method 
we sold our investment in these bulk carrier companies at the end of the decrease also resulted from lower interest rates earned on invested funds in the current period  partially offset by higher invested balances 
loss on early extinguishment of debt of  reported in was due to the early retirement of debt associated with our molten sulphur carrier  as well as the retirement at a slight premium of  of our senior notes due in the loss of million in resulted from a make whole prepayment penalty and write off of deferred financing charges associated with the necessary prepayment of our coal carrier loan to cure a technical default see usgenne bankruptcy filing in liquidity and capital resources 
this was partially offset by the retirement at a discount of approximately million of our senior notes due in see note a summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this form k on page f 
income taxes we had a tax benefit for federal income taxes of million in and a tax provision of million in the statutory rate was for both years 
year included an addition to net income in the amount of million reflecting a reduction in our net deferred tax provision brought about by the enactment of the jobs creation act during the fourth quarter of passage of this new tax act  and our election in december of for our qualified domestic operations to be taxed under the tonnage tax provision of the new law  rendered certain net deferred tax provisions booked in prior years unnecessary 
for a discussion of the jobs creation act and its estimated effect on our results of operations  see note f income taxes of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this form k on page f equity in net income of unconsolidated entities equity in net income of unconsolidated entities  net of taxes  increased from  in to million in the improvement was primarily related to our investment in a company owning two cape size bulk carriers and our minority interest in companies owning and operating cement carriers 
our investment in the cape size bulk carrier company  which was acquired in november of  contributed million net of taxes in compared with  in our investment in the cement carrier company contributed  net of taxes in compared to  net of taxes in the increase in resulted primarily from higher charter rates 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  gross voyage profit gross voyage profit increased from million in to million in the changes associated with each of our segments are discussed below 
liner service gross voyage loss for this segment improved from a loss of million in to a loss of million in our us flag lash liner service s gross voyage loss improved from a loss of million in to a profit of  in primarily due to expenses  included in  associated with winding down the previous four vessel service  while results reflect the current one vessel operation 
as a partial offset  our foreign flag lash liner service s gross voyage profit decreased from million in to million in primarily due to lower cargo volume and higher than anticipated operating costs in additionally  depreciation on this segment s assets and operating lease expense increased from million in to million in due to upgrade work performed in late on one of our lash vessels 
time charter contracts this segment s gross voyage profit decreased from million in to million in unanticipated vessel repairs resulting from machinery deficiencies on one of our multi purpose vessels in the third quarter contributed to the decrease in gross voyage profit 
the cost of the repairs and resulting vessel downtime impacted this segment by approximately million 
additionally  vessel and barge depreciation increased resulting from a reduction in the estimated useful life of one of our multi purpose vessel  which was sold during the fourth quarter of partially offsetting this decrease was our coal carrier operating on time charter to usgenne  which experienced higher results due to the vessel being utilized for all but two days during under its basic time charter contract as compared to when it was out of service thirty three days for repairs and during which it operated days in the spot market at lower rates as compared to its basic charter 
contracts of affreightment gross voyage profit decreased from million in to million in primarily due to higher operating costs in and from a payment received in for loss of hire from an insurance claim relating to pre existing damages identified during a scheduled drydocking 
rail ferry service gross voyage loss for this segment improved from a loss of million in to a loss of million in the improvement was a result of higher cargo volume during other this segment s gross voyage profit improved from a loss of million in to a profit of million in contributing to the improved results was the closing of our singapore office  which operated at a loss during  and the improved results of our insurance subsidiary  which operates solely to cover self retained insurance risks 
the results of benefited from a full year s operation of our owned car transportation truck company as well as the results of two chartered vessels that we are operating under msp contracts  which only operated for half of other income and expenses gain on sale of vessels and other assets of million in primarily related to the sale of our multi purpose vessel  which completed its commitment under charter with the msc and was no longer needed for operations  and the sale of special purpose barges no longer needed for current operations 
the net gain of  in primarily related to the sale of certain contract rights that were no longer beneficial to us and the sale of certain assets no longer needed for operations 
interest expense decreased from million in to million in decreases due to lower outstanding debt balances and lower interest rates accounted for million of the total difference 
approximately million of the decrease resulted from the early repayment of our senior notes and repurchases of our senior notes  which was partially offset by the cost of new financings used to repurchase some of the notes 
investment income increased from  in to million in primarily as a result of higher dividend income received in from our investment in certain bulk carrier companies accounted for under the cost method  and interest earned on a receivable which resulted from the fourth quarter sale and leaseback of one of our foreign flag lash vessels 
this was partially offset by lower invested balances and lower interest rates earned on invested funds in the current period 
other income of million in was a result of interest collected in on foreign tax refunds 
loss on early extinguishment of debt of million in resulted from a make whole prepayment penalty and write off of deferred financing charges associated with the necessary prepayment of our coal carrier loan to cure a technical default see usgenne bankruptcy filing in liquidity and capital resources 
this was partially offset by a discount on the retirement of approximately million of our senior notes due in see note a summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this form k on page f 
income taxes we had a tax provision for federal income taxes of million in and a tax benefit of  in the statutory rate was for both years 
equity in net income of unconsolidated entities equity in net income of unconsolidated entities  net of taxes  of  for and  for  was primarily related to our investment in companies owning and operating cement carrying vessels 
the decrease in the equity in net income of was primarily due to a write off of an uncollectable charterhire receivable by one of these companies 
liquidity and capital resources the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the more detailed consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere herein as part of our consolidated financial statements 
our working capital increased from million at december   to million at december  of the million in current liabilities at december   million related to current maturities of long term debt 
cash and cash equivalents increased during by million to a total of million 
this increase was due to cash provided by operating activities of million  partially offset by cash used for investing activities of million and for financing activities of million 
operating activities generated a positive cash flow after adjusting net income of million for non cash provisions such as depreciation and amortization 
cash provided by operating activities also included a decrease in accounts receivable of million primarily due to the timing of collections of receivables from the msc and us department of transportation  slightly offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million primarily due to the timing of payments to us customs in also included was cash used of million primarily to cover payments for vessel drydocking costs in cash used for investing activities of million included purchases of two container vessels and non vessel related assets used by our over the road car transportation truck company  offset by cash distributions received from our investments in unconsolidated entities 
cash used for financing activities of million included million used for regularly scheduled payments of debt  million used to repay draws on our line of credit made during the year  million used for early repayment of two of our debt obligations  and million used for additional payments on our title xi loan  which was partially offset by draws on our line of credit of million 
at december   million was available on our million revolving credit facility  of which million was repaid in january of from the proceeds of our preferred stock offering 
the facility expires in december of preferred stock offering on january   we announced the completion of our public offering of  shares of convertible exchangeable preferred stock with a liquidation preference of per share  or million in total 
the preferred stock will accrue cash dividends from the date of issuance at a rate of per annum 
the preferred stock is initially convertible into two million shares of our common stock  equivalent to an initial conversion price of per share of our common stock and reflecting a conversion premium to the per share closing price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange on december  all shares of the preferred stock  which is a new series of our capital stock  were sold 
debt and lease obligations we operate several vessels under operating leases  including three pctcs  one lash vessel  one breakbulk multi purpose vessel  a container vessel and a tanker vessel 
we also conduct certain of our operations from leased office facilities and use certain transportation and other equipment under operating leases 
the following is a summary of the scheduled maturities by period of our debt and lease obligations that were outstanding as of december  debt and lease obligations s thereafter long term debt including current maturities       operating leases       total by period       included in the table above in year is million that we drew on our credit facility in late and repaid in january of debt covenant compliance status we have met the minimum working capital and net worth requirements of our debt agreements during the period covered by the agreements  once amended effective june of and march of in order to purchase two container vessels prior to december   we drew  on our credit facility in late and repaid that amount early in january of with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our convertible exchangeable preferred stock 
having these draws outstanding on our credit facility as of december   caused us to be in non compliance with our leverage ratio as stated in the agreements at december  however  prior to december   we obtained waivers from our lenders with respect to this matter of non compliance with the leverage requirements 
we had originally anticipated closing our preferred stock offering prior to december  if the closing had occurred prior to december  we would have met all financial and other covenants  including the leverage requirements 
we are currently in compliance again with all our restrictive covenants and believe we will continue to meet these requirements throughout  although we can give no assurance to that effect 
if our cash flow and capital resources are not sufficient to fund our debt service obligations or if we are unable to meet our covenant requirements  we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets  obtain additional equity capital  enter into additional financings of our unencumbered vessels or restructure debt 
rail ferry service results our rail ferry service provides a unique combination of rail and water ferry service between the us gulf and mexico 
as with any innovative venture  we expected and have experienced an adjustment period for the market to embrace our alternative service 
low operating profit margins are inherent in the rail ferry business 
accordingly  high cargo volumes are necessary to achieve meaningful levels of cash flow and profitability 
the capacity of the vessels operating in our rail ferry service has limited the revenues and  in turn  the cash flow and gross profits that can be generated by our rail ferry service segment 
we intend to add a second deck to each of the two vessels operating in our rail ferry service in order to essentially double their capacity 
we believe that these additions will significantly reduce our cost per unit of cargo carried and significantly increase our cash flow  but only if we are able to book substantially all of the additional capacity  and we can give no assurance at this time that we will be successful in doing so 
if market conditions adversely affect those expectations  we believe we could find alternative placement for the two vessels supporting the service 
we expect the vessels to begin shipyard work in mid and fully return to service in the second half of usgenne bankruptcy filing as previously discussed  we charter our coal carrier to usgenne 
in july of  usgenne filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code and subsequently requested an extension of time to submit its bankruptcy plan until march   and an extension until may   to obtain acceptance to its plan 
upon the acquisition of our vessel  we had issued million in notes  which had an outstanding balance of approximately million at the time of the bankruptcy filing 
although the notes were non recourse to the company  the indenture under which they were issued provided that usgenne s bankruptcy filing was an event of default under the notes as well as a cross default on certain of our other credit facilities 
during  we secured alternative financing  which was used to pay the notes in full in addition to a make whole prepayment penalty 
the payment of the notes in cured the cross defaults under the other credit facilities 
therefore  we are no longer in default under any of our credit facilities 
in november of  the bankruptcy courts approved usgenne s sale of a substantial portion of its generation assets to dominion energy new england  inc  a subsidiary of dominion resources  inc 
pursuant to the asset purchase agreement  which became effective on january   virginia power energy marketing  inc  another subsidiary of dominion resources  inc  has assumed the charter in place of usgenne for the full period through and under the same terms 
maritime security program contracts in  congress authorized an extension of the msp through  increased the number of ships industry wide eligible to participate in the program from to  and increased msp payments to companies in the program  all to be effective on october  annual payments for each vessel in the new msp program will be million in years to  million in years to  and million in years to on october   we filed applications to extend our seven msp contracts for another years  all of which were effectively grandfathered in the msp reauthorization 
on january   we were awarded one additional msp contract  effective october   for a net total of eight msp contracts 
we are currently exploring our options to fulfill the contract requirement 
dividend payments the preferred stock will accrue cash dividends from the date of issuance at a rate of per annum  which are payable quarterly  commencing march  the payment of preferred stock dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors 
as a result of our preferred stock offering  we are restricted from paying common stock dividends and acquiring any of our common stock prior to december  environmental issue we have not been notified that we are a potentially responsible party in connection with any environmental matters  and we have determined that we have no known risks for which assertion of a claim is probable that are not covered by third party insurance  provided for in our self retention insurance reserves or otherwise indemnified 
our environmental risks primarily relate to oil pollution from the operation of our vessels 
we have pollution liability insurance coverage with a limit of billion per each occurrence  with a deductible amount of  for each incident 
new accounting pronouncements in january of  the fasb issued financial accounting series interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity  where the company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns  or both 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
fin also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that the company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
we have investments in certain unconsolidated entities in which we have less than ownership 
we have evaluated these investments and determined that we do not have any investments in variable interest entities 
therefore  the adoption of fin no 
as of january  did not have an impact on the financial statements 
in december of  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no

statement no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosures are no longer an alternative 
statement no 
r is effective for periods beginning after june  we plan to adopt sfas r on july  statement no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method or a modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  companies are required to record compensation cost for new and modified awards over the related vesting period of such awards prospectively and record compensation cost prospectively for the unvested portion  at the date of adoption  of previously issued and outstanding awards over the remaining vesting period of such awards 
no change to prior periods presented is permitted under the modified prospective method 
under the modified retrospective method  companies record compensation costs for prior periods retroactively through restatement of such periods using the pro forma amounts previously disclosed in the footnotes 
also  in the period of adoption and after  companies record compensation cost based on the modified prospective method 
we have not yet determined the method of adoption we will use 
as permitted by statement no 
 we account for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
and no compensation expense has been recognized for employee options granted under the stock incentive plan 
accordingly  the adoption of statement no 
r s fair value method will have an impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
however  the impact of adoption of statement no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement no 
r in prior periods  there would have been no impact as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note e employee benefit plans of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this form k on page f item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of our business  we are exposed to foreign currency  interest rate  and commodity price risk 
we utilize derivative financial instruments including interest rate swap agreements  forward exchange contracts and commodity swap agreements to manage certain of these exposures 
we hedge only firm commitments or anticipated transactions and do not use derivatives for speculation 
we neither hold nor issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk the fair value of our cash and short term investment portfolio at december   approximated carrying value due to its short term duration 
the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates at year end for our investment portfolio is not material 
the fair value of long term debt  including current maturities  was estimated to be million compared to a carrying value of million 
the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in the borrowing rates applicable to our long term debt at december   would be approximately million or of the carrying value 
commodity price risk as of december   we have no commodity swap agreements to manage our exposure to price risk related to the purchase of the estimated fuel requirements for our liner services or rail ferry service segment 
if we had such an arrangement  it would be structured to reduce our exposure to increases in fuel prices  however  it would also limit the benefit we might otherwise receive from any price decreases associated with this commodity 
a increase in the price of fuel for the period january  through december  would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in our fuel costs for the same period  and in a corresponding decrease of approximately in our earnings per share based on the shares of our common stock outstanding as of december   assuming that none of the price increase could have been passed on to our customers through fuel cost surcharges during the same period 
foreign exchange rate risk we have entered into foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain firm purchase and sale commitments with varying maturities throughout the exchange rates at which these hedges were entered into did not materially differ from the exchange rates in effect at december  the potential fair value of these contracts that would have resulted from a hypothetical adverse change in the exchange rates applicable to these contracts at december   is a liability of approximately  assuming that none of the rate increases could have been passed on to our customers through currency surcharges
