item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations year ended december  as compared to net sales for decreased primarily as a result of declines in the revenues from the company s retail business segment 
the decline in net sales for the retail segment was approximately  largely as a result of the return to a normal level of sales of quinsana medicated talc to the military as a result of the stabilization of troops deployed to the middle east 
the professional segment showed a small sales decrease  with an increase in hard goods sales offsetting most of the decline in wet goods sales 
gross profit decreased  to  in when compared to levels

for the year ended december   based upon an average number of shares outstanding of  in and  in year ended december  as compared to net sales increased slightly for the year ended december   and were favorably impacted by a higher than normal volume of sales of quinsana medicated talc to the military  as a result of the deployment of troops to the middle east 
this factor was instrumental in increasing net sales for the retail segment by almost  it also helped increase the overall gross profit margin of the company because of the favorable impact these sales had on the sales mix 
earnings per share  before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  for the year ended december  was  compared to the 
per share achieved for the comparable period in net sales of professional wet goods for the year ended december  declined approximately  however  the net sales of hard goods increased approximately  for that same period  leaving the overall professional segment down approximately  from the comparable period in as a result of the decline in the net sales of wet goods  as described above  net sales of the manufacturing segment also declined 
a small portion of this decline can be attributed to a decline in private label manufacturing 
gross profit for the year ended december   increased to  from the  achieved in the comparable period of the gross margin in was  compared to in these increases  as indicated above  were due to the more favorable sales mix realized by the company as a result of higher sales of retail products 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased substantially over the comparable period in  largely as a result of management bonuses due officers in accordance with their employment contracts

the provision for income taxes of  provided for in the statement of operations includes state income taxes of approximately  payable to certain states outside of florida where the company is deemed to have a business nexus 
in addition  both federal and state income taxes were adversely affected by the non deductibility of certain expenses incurred in connection with the going private transaction and are considered permanent differences 
liquidity and capital resources working capital decreased  from december   and was approximately  at december  cash and cash equivalents decreased to  as compared to  as of december  the decline in working capital and cash is significantly due to the payment of a per share special dividend approximately  in september  total cash  including restricted cash  decreased from  at december  to  at december  the company has continued to secure its outstanding long term debt with wachovia bank with restricted cash 
the long term portion of restricted cash is classified as non current and not included in working capital or cash and cash equivalents

the company does not have any off balance sheet financing or similar arrangements 
inventory levels declined as management sustained efforts to reduce the overall amount of inventory on hand  both through the use of effective inventory control techniques  as well as a continuing write down of old  obsolete or slow moving items 
the company has not experienced any material adverse impact from the effects of inflation in the last several years 
management maintains some flexibility to increase prices and does not have any binding contract pricing with either customers or vendors 
many of the company s products  as well as the components used  are petroleum based products  and as a result  the prices for raw materials are and will continue to be subject to oil prices which  in turn  are subject to various political or economic pressures 
the company does not presently foresee any material increase in the costs of raw materials or component costs  and our management believes it has the flexibility of calling upon multiple vendors and the ability to increase prices to offset any price changes  however  if this trend continues  it may adversely impact the company s gross profit margin

in accordance with the rules and regulations of the american stock exchange amex  the company was required to promptly notify its stockholders and amex  in writing  indicating the reasons for the failure to have a meeting and to use good faith efforts to ensure that an annual meeting is held as soon as reasonably practicable 
the company included annual meeting materials in its revised proxy statement  filed with the sec on april  in a press release issued by the company on october   the company indicated that the next annual meeting of shareholders  previously set for november   had been delayed  and the company expected to formally notify all shareholders of the definitive date and location of such meeting in the near future 
the company was required by amex to file a corporate governance certification by october   but has been unable to do so because the composition of the board of directors and the audit committee does not meet the enhanced independent requirements of amex 
on november   the company received a warning letter from amex indicating that the company was deficient with respect to the above  in addition to not being in compliance with nominating committee requirements and a web site posting or other public notice of a code of conduct and ethics for all directors  officers and employees 
by january   the company became compliant by appointing another independent board member and filing the appropriate corporate governance certification

discussion of critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates if different assumptions were used or different events ultimately transpire 
we believe that the following are the most critical accounting policies that requires management to make difficult  subjective and or complex judgments  often due to a need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain valuation of accounts receivable the ultimate amount of collections received against outstanding accounts receivable must take into account returns  allowances and deductions that may be made by our customers 
many retailers to whom we sell products take deductions for various forms of marketing expenses  as well as participating in nationwide reclamation cooperatives for processing damaged goods 
other expenses to which we are subject to  in addition to those experienced in the retail environment but also with professional products sold to distributors include deductions for freight if the invoice is paid within specified terms  co op advertising allowances  new store warehouse allowances and  from time to time  limited rebate programs 
we attempt to estimate these costs  as well as providing for anticipated bad debts  by recording allowances based upon our experience  economic conditions  normal customer inventory levels and or competitive conditions 
actual returns  credits or allowances  as well as the condition of any product actually returned  may differ significantly from the estimates used by the company 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined by the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
we periodically evaluate inventory levels  giving consideration to factors such as the physical condition of the goods  the sales patterns of finished goods and the useful life of particular packaging  componentry and finished goods and estimate a reasonable write down amount to be provided for slow moving  obsolete or damaged inventory 
these estimates could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements based upon future economic conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive factors that were not foreseen or did not exist when the inventory write downs were established 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill the company periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate that long lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may be impaired 
when such events or circumstances are present  the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset 
if the results of this testing indicates an impairment of the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
the long term nature of these assets requires the estimation of its cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration circumstances known at the time of the impairment test 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are to be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis  and between annual tests  whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may exceed its fair value 
the use of various acceptable and appropriate methods of valuation requires the use of long term planning forecasts and assumptions regarding industry specific economic conditions that are outside the control of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company does not own or maintain an interest in derivative or other financial instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
in addition  the company does not invest in securities that would require disclosure of market risk  nor does it have floating rate loans or foreign currency exchange rate risks 
the company has no interest rate risk on its fixed rate debt since the interest rate on the note payable to a bank resets annually upon the anniversary of the loan august at basis points above the interest rate earned on the restricted cash that collateralizes the loan
