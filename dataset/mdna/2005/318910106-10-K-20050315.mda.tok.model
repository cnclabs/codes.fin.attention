item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis is intended to assist readers in understanding the company s results of operations and changes in financial position for the past three years 
this review should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes beginning on page of this report and the supplemental financial data contained in tables through included with this discussion and analysis 
all share data has been adjusted to reflect the for stock split paid on november  critical accounting policies the accounting principles followed by the company and the methods of applying these principles conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and with general practices followed by the banking industry 
certain of these principles involve a significant amount of judgment and or use of estimates based on the company s best assumptions at the time of the estimation 
the company has identified three policies as being more sensitive in terms of judgments and estimates  taking into account their overall potential impact to the company s consolidated financial statements the allowance for loan losses  tax uncertainties  and intangible assets 
allowance for loan losses due to the estimation process and the potential materiality of the amounts involved  the company has identified the accounting for the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses as an accounting policy critical to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the provision for loan losses charged to operations is an amount sufficient to bring the allowance for loan losses to an estimated balance considered adequate to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based primarily on a mathematical model that estimates the appropriate allowance for loan losses 
this model has two components 
the first component involves the estimation of losses on loans defined as impaired loans 
a loan is considered to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the estimated valuation allowance is the difference  if any  between the loan balance outstanding and the value of the impaired loan as determined by either an estimate of the cash flows that the company expects to receive from the borrower discounted at the loan s effective rate  or in the case of a collateral dependent loan  the fair value of the collateral 
the second component of the allowance model is to estimate losses for all loans not considered to be impaired loans 
first  loans that have been risk graded by the company as having more than standard risk but are not considered to be impaired are assigned estimated loss percentages generally accepted in the banking industry 
loans that are classified by the company as having normal credit risk are segregated by loan type  and estimated loss percentages are assigned to each loan type  based on the historical losses  current economic conditions  and operational conditions specific to each loan type 
the reserve estimated for impaired loans is then added to the reserve estimated for all other loans 
this becomes the company s allocated allowance 
in addition to the allocated allowance derived from the model  management also evaluates other data such as the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans  net loan growth information  nonperforming asset levels and trends in such data 
based on this additional analysis  the company may determine that an additional amount of allowance for loan losses is necessary to reserve for probable losses 
this additional amount  if any  is the company s unallocated allowance 
the sum of the allocated allowance and the unallocated allowance is compared to the actual allowance for loan losses recorded on the books of the company and any adjustment necessary for the recorded allowance to equal the computed allowance is recorded as a provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses is a direct charge to earnings in the period recorded 
although management uses the best information available to make evaluations  future adjustments may be necessary if economic  operational  or other conditions change 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on the examiners judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
for further discussion including a review of the range of provisions for loan losses and its impact on reported results in recent periods  see nonperforming assets and allowance for loan losses and loan loss experience under analysis of financial condition and changes in financial condition 
tax uncertainties the company reserves for tax uncertainties in instances when it has taken a position on a tax return that may differ from the opinion of the applicable taxing authority 
in accounting for tax contingencies  the company assesses the relative merits and risks of certain tax transactions  taking into account statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the company s tax position 
for those matters where it is probable that the company will have to pay additional taxes  interest or penalties and a loss or range of losses can be reasonably estimated  the company records reserves in the consolidated financial statements 
for those matters where it is reasonably possible but not probable that the company will have to pay additional taxes  interest or penalties and the loss or range of losses can be reasonably estimated  the company only makes disclosures in the notes and does not record reserves in the consolidated financial statements 
the process of concluding that a loss is reasonably possible or probable and estimating the amount of loss or range of losses and related tax reserves is inherently subjective and future changes to the reserve may be necessary based on changes in management s intent  tax law or related interpretations  or other functions 
the section below entitled liquidity  commitments  and contingencies and note to the consolidated financial statements includes the disclosure of a tax uncertainty that the company has concluded requires disclosure  but not loss accrual 
intangible assets due to the estimation process and the potential materiality of the amounts involved  the company has also identified the accounting for intangible assets as an accounting policy critical to the company s consolidated financial statements 
when the company completes an acquisition transaction  the excess of the purchase price over the amount by which the fair market value of assets acquired exceeds the fair market value of liabilities assumed represents an intangible asset 
the company must then determine the identifiable portions of the intangible asset  with any remaining amount classified as goodwill 
identifiable intangible assets associated with these acquisitions are generally amortized over the estimated life of the related asset  whereas goodwill is tested annually for impairment  but not systematically amortized 
assuming no goodwill impairment  it is beneficial to the company s future earnings to have a lower amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets and higher amount of goodwill as opposed to having a higher amount considered to be identifiable intangible assets and a lower amount classified as goodwill 
for the company  the primary identifiable intangible asset typically recorded in connection with a whole bank or bank branch acquisition is the value of the core deposit intangible  whereas when the company acquires an insurance agency  the primary identifiable intangible asset is the value of the acquired customer list 
determining the amount of identifiable intangible assets and their average lives involves multiple assumptions and estimates and is typically determined by performing a discounted cash flow analysis  which involves a combination of any or all of the following assumptions customer attrition runoff  alternative funding costs  deposit servicing costs  and discount rates 
the company typically engages a third party consultant to assist in each analysis 
for the whole bank and bank branch transactions recorded to date  the core deposit intangible in each case has been estimated to have a ten year life  with an accelerated rate of amortization 
for the insurance agency acquisition  the identifiable intangible asset related to the customer list was determined to have a ten year life  with amortization occurring on a straight line basis 
subsequent to the initial recording of the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill  the company amortizes the identifiable intangible assets over their estimated average lives  as discussed above 
in addition  on at least an annual basis  goodwill is evaluated for impairment by comparing the fair value of the company s reporting units to their related carrying value  including goodwill the company s community banking operation is its only material reporting unit 
at its last evaluation  the fair value of the company s community banking operation exceeded its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit were ever to exceed its fair value  the company would determine whether the implied fair value of the goodwill  using a discounted cash flow analysis  exceeded the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss would be recorded in an amount equal to that excess 
performing such a discounted cash flow analysis would involve the significant use of estimates and assumptions 
the company reviews identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the company s policy is that an impairment loss is recognized  equal to the difference between the asset s carrying amount and its fair value  if the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
estimating future cash flows involves the use of multiple estimates and assumptions  such as those listed above 
the foregoing accounting policy was adopted by the company effective on january  in accordance with newly issued accounting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets 
for acquisitions occurring prior to january   the company generally did not separately identify its identifiable intangible assets from its goodwill  as all intangible assets were amortized under accounting standards then in effect 
according to the transition provisions of the accounting standards that changed the company s accounting policy to that described above  the entire amount of those combined intangible assets was accounted for entirely as non amortizable goodwill 
merger and acquisition activity over the past three fiscal years  the company has completed several acquisitions  which have resulted in significant amounts of intangible assets being recorded by the company  as detailed below 
as noted above  the accounting for intangible assets changed significantly in with the company being required under new accounting standards to cease the amortization of goodwill 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding intangible assets 
the company did not announce or complete any acquisitions in the company completed the following acquisitions during a on january   the company completed the acquisition of uwharrie insurance group  inc uwharrie  a montgomery county based property and casualty insurance agency 
uwharrie was subsequently merged into first bank insurance 
with eight employees  uwharrie served approximately  customers  primarily from its troy based headquarters  and had annual commissions of approximately  the primary reason for the acquisition was to gain efficiencies of scale with the company s existing property and casualty insurance business 
the acquisition resulted in the company recording an intangible asset of approximately  based on an independent appraisal   of the intangible asset recorded was determined to be attributable to the value of the noncompete agreement signed as part of the transaction and is being amortized over its two year life   was determined to be attributable to the value of the customer list and is being amortized on a straight line basis over ten years  and the remaining  was determined to be goodwill and thus is not being systematically amortized  but rather is subject to an annual impairment test 
b on january   the company completed the acquisition of carolina community bancshares  inc ccb  the parent company of carolina community bank  a south carolina community bank with three branches in dillon county  south carolina 
this represented the company s first entry into south carolina 
dillon county  south carolina is contiguous to robeson county  north carolina  a county where the company already operated four branches 
the company s primary reason for the acquisition was to expand into a contiguous market with facilities  operations and experienced staff in place 
in this transaction  the shareholders of ccb received shares of the company s stock and in cash for each share of ccb stock they owned at the time of closing 
the transaction was completed on january   with the company paying cash of million  issuing  shares of common stock that were valued at approximately million  and assuming employee stock options with an intrinsic value of approximately million 
as of the date of the acquisition  ccb had approximately million in loans  million in deposits and million in total assets 
in connection with the acquisition of ccb  the company recorded total intangible assets of million  of which  was determined to be the value of the core deposit base and is being amortized on an accelerated basis over ten years  and million was determined to be goodwill and thus is not being systematically amortized  but rather is subject to an annual impairment test 
c on october   the company completed the acquisition of four branches of rbc centura bank located in fairmont  harmony  kenansville  and wallace  all in north carolina 
as of the date of the acquisition  the branches had a total of approximately million in deposits and million in loans 
the primary reason for the acquisition was to expand into new markets and increase the company s customer base 
subject to certain limitations  the company paid a deposit premium of for the branches  which resulted in the company recording intangible assets relating to this purchase of million 
the identifiable intangible asset associated with the fair value of the core deposit base  as determined by an independent consulting firm  was valued at approximately million and is being amortized as expense on an accelerated basis over a ten year period 
the remaining intangible asset of million has been classified as goodwill  and thus is not being systematically amortized  but rather is subject to an annual impairment test 
the following table contains a condensed balance sheet that indicates the amount assigned to each major asset and liability as of the respective acquisition dates for the acquisitions described above 
uwharrie carolina rbc insurance community centura assets acquired group bank branches total in millions cash securities loans  gross allowance for loan losses premises and equipment other total assets acquired liabilities assumed deposits borrowings other total liabilities assumed value of cash paid and or stock issued to stock holders of acquiree n a intangible assets recorded the company completed one acquisition in as follows a on october   the company completed the purchase of a branch of rbc centura bank located in broadway  north carolina 
the company assumed the branch s million in deposits and million in loans 
the primary reason for this acquisition was to increase the company s presence in lee county  a market where the company already had two branches with a large customer base 
an intangible asset of million  all of which was allocated to goodwill  was recorded in connection with this acquisition 
there are many factors that the company considers when evaluating how much to offer for potential acquisition candidates in the form of a purchase price comprised of cash and or stock for a whole company purchase or a deposit premium in a branch purchase 
most significantly  the company compares expectations of future earnings per share on a stand alone basis with projected future earnings per share assuming completion of the acquisition under various pricing scenarios 
significant assumptions that affect this analysis include the estimated future earnings stream of the acquisition candidate  the amount of cost efficiencies that can be realized  and the interest rate earned lost on the cash received paid 
in addition to the earnings per share comparison  the company also considers other factors including but not limited to marketplace acquisition statistics  location of the candidate in relation to the company s expansion strategy  market growth potential  management of the candidate  potential integration issues including corporate culture  and the size of the acquisition candidate 
analysis of results of operations net interest income  the spread between earnings on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  constitutes the largest source of the company s earnings 
other factors that significantly affect operating results are the provision for loan losses  noninterest income such as service fees and noninterest expenses such as salaries  occupancy expense  equipment expense and other overhead costs  as well as the effects of income taxes 
overview compared to net income for the year ended december  amounted to  or per diluted share  a increase in net income and a increase in diluted earnings per share over the net income of  or per diluted share  reported for all per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the for stock split paid on november  total assets at december  amounted to billion  higher than a year earlier 
total loans at december  amounted to billion  a increase from a year earlier  and total deposits amounted to billion at december   an increase from a year earlier 
approximately million of the total deposit increase of million related to wholesale brokered deposits that the company gathered in order to help fund the high loan growth experienced during the increase in loans and deposits over the past twelve months resulted in an increase in the company s net interest income from to net interest income for the year ended december  amounted to million  a increase over the million recorded in the positive impact on net interest income from the increases in loans and deposits more than offset a lower net interest margin realized in compared to the company s net interest margin tax equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets for was compared to the in the company s net interest margin was negatively impacted by the thirteen interest rate cuts initiated by the federal reserve from to and the company s shift toward originating more adjustable rate loans compared to fixed rate loans to protect the company from anticipated increases in interest rates 
the federal reserve increased interest rates by basis points in the second half of which was responsible for the company s net interest margin increasing during the third and fourth quarters of after having decreased for the immediately preceding five consecutive quarters 
the company s provision for loan losses did not vary significantly in compared to  amounting to  in compared to  in the company s asset quality ratios remained sound in  with a net charge off ratio net charge offs divided by average loans of in compared to in  and a december  nonperforming asset to total asset ratio of  compared to at the prior year end 
for the year ended  noninterest income amounted to million  a increase from million in except for fees from presold mortgages  most components of noninterest income increased for the year ended compared to as a result of the company s overall growth  particularly the company s october acquisition of four bank branches with million in deposits  which impacted the company s noninterest income for all twelve months of compared to only three months in fees from presold mortgages decreased significantly in as a result of a decline in mortgage refinancing activity caused by higher mortgage interest rates 
fees from presold mortgages decreased from million in to million in the company realized securities gains and other gains of  in compared to  in noninterest expenses for the year ended december  amounted to million  a increase from the million recorded in the increase in noninterest expenses is primarily attributable to growth in the company s branch network  which increased by eight branches since october the company s effective tax rates were slightly lower for compared to  amounting to in compared to for the lower effective tax rate in was caused by several factors including higher amounts of state tax exempt income  higher amounts of low income housing investment tax credits  and the reversal of an  tax liability that was recorded in connection with a previous corporate acquisition 
overview compared to net income for the year ended december  amounted to  or per diluted share  a increase in net income and a increase in diluted earnings per share over the net income of  or per diluted share  reported for the twelve months ended december  the increase in net income in was primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income 
net interest income for the year ended december  amounted to million  an increase of million  or  over the million recorded in the increase in net interest income was caused primarily by growth in the company s loans and deposits 
average loans outstanding during were billion  or higher than in  while average deposits outstanding increased by in to billion 
the positive impact on net interest income from the increases in loans and deposits more than offset a slightly lower net interest margin realized in compared to the company s net interest margin tax equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets for the year ended december  was compared to the net interest margin realized for the slight decrease in net interest margin was caused primarily by the negative impact of the interest rate cuts initiated by the federal reserve in the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of the provision for loan losses did not vary significantly in compared to  amounting to  and  respectively 
the company s asset quality ratios were sound in both years  with a net charge off ratio net charge offs divided by average loans of in compared to in  and a december  nonperforming asset to total asset ratio of  compared to at the prior year end 
most components of noninterest income and noninterest expense also increased in as a result of the company s overall growth 
noninterest income for was also positively impacted by high refinancing activity driven by a low interest rate environment that increased the amount of fees from presold mortgages  the acquisition of uwharrie insurance group  which increased commissions from financial product sales  and securities gains 
the company s income taxes increased from  in to  in the increase in income tax expense was a result of higher income before income taxes 
the effective income tax rate for both years was approximately 
net interest income net interest income on a reported basis amounted to  in   in  and  in for internal purposes and in the discussion that follows  the company evaluates its net interest income on a tax equivalent basis by adding the tax benefit realized from tax exempt securities to reported interest income 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis amounted to  in   in  and  in table analyzes net interest income on a tax equivalent basis 
the company s net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased by in and in there are two primary factors that cause changes in the amount of net interest income recorded by the company growth in loans and deposits  and the company s net interest margin tax equivalent net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
as illustrated in table  in both and  net interest income was positively impacted by higher amounts of average loans and deposits outstanding 
in  the average amount of loans outstanding increased  and the average amount of deposits outstanding increased 
in  the average amount of loans outstanding increased  and the average amount of deposits outstanding increased 
the higher amounts of average loans and deposits outstanding in and were a result of both internal growth  as well as growth achieved in corporate acquisitions 
although the company did not complete any acquisitions in  the increases in the company s average loan and deposit amounts in compared to were impacted by acquisitions completed in  as the loans and deposits assumed in the acquisitions were outstanding for the full year in compared to only a partial year in from the date of the respective acquisitions 
for additional analysis regarding the nature of the company s loan and deposit growth see analysis of financial condition and changes in financial condition overview below 
table also illustrates that changes in interest rates resulted in reductions in interest income and interest expense in and in  interest rates earned paid were both lower due to a lower interest rate environment 
in  although the average prime rate was slightly higher than in  the average yields realized on earning assets and the average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities for the year were both lower than in the average yield on earning assets was lower in than in due to a growing percentage of adjustable rate loans  which carry lower initial rates than fixed rate loans see below for additional discussion  and lower renewal reinvestment rates earned on fixed rate earning assets that matured during that had been originated during periods of higher interest rates 
the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was lower in than in due to the interest rates on deposits that are set by management not being increased at the same time  or by the full amount  as increases in the prime rate of interest that occurred in also  interest expense on time deposits was otherwise lower as a result of time deposits that were originated prior to the increases in interest rates  with maturities subsequent to the dates of the rate changes 
the reduction in interest income for both years was more than the reduction in interest expense  and thus changes in interest rates negatively impacted the company s net interest income in both years 
however  the positive impact of having higher amounts of loans and deposits more than offset the negative impact that rates had on the company  resulting in the increases in net interest income experienced in and the company measures the spread between the yield on its earning assets and the cost of its funding primarily in terms of the ratio entitled net interest margin which is defined as tax equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets 
the company s net interest margin has declined in each of the past two years  amounting to in  in  and in the company s net interest margin was negatively impacted by the interest rate environment and a shift towards originating more adjustable rate loans compared to fixed rate loans to protect the company from an expected rise in interest rates 
the mostly declining interest rate environment in effect from until june   and the level to which it dropped  resulted in the company being unable to reset deposit rates by an amount that would offset the negative impact of the lower yields earned on the company s interest earning assets 
in the declining rate environment  the company s interest sensitive assets repriced sooner most on the day following the interest rate cut and by a larger percentage generally by the same number of basis points that the federal reserve discount rate was decreased than did the company s interest sensitive liabilities that were subject to repricing 
additionally  as fixed rate earning assets originated during periods of higher interest rates matured  they were generally replaced with lower yielding earning assets 
the company was unable to reset deposit rates by the full amount of the interest rate cuts because of their already near zero rates and because of competitive pricing pressures 
also  interest rates paid on time deposits are generally fixed and are not subject to automatic adjustment 
when time deposits mature  the company has the opportunity  at the customers discretion  to renew the time deposit at a rate set by the company 
because time deposits that are interest sensitive in a twelve month horizon mature throughout the twelve month period  any change in the renewal rate will affect only a portion of the twelve month period 
also  although changes in interest rates on renewing time deposits generally track rate changes in the interest rate environment  the company found it especially difficult to decrease rates on renewing time deposits by the corresponding decreases in the federal reserve discount rate because of competitive pressures in the company s market areas 
the shift in the company s loan mix from fixed rate loans to adjustable rate loans has occurred primarily over the past three years 
at december   the company s loan portfolio was comprised of fixed rate loans and adjustable rate loans 
since that time  the ratio gradually shifted as the company has originated more adjustable rate loans than fixed rate loans 
at december   the company s loan portfolio was comprised of adjustable rate loans and fixed rate loans 
the primary reason for this shift was that with interest rates at historically low levels  the company more attractively priced adjustable rate loans in order to avoid locking in fixed rate loans at a time when most economists believed that rates would inevitably rise 
although the company believes that this strategy was prudent given the historically low interest rate environment  it has had a negative effect on the company s recently realized net interest margins because adjustable rate loans carry lower initial rates than fixed rate loans of similar maturities 
additionally  the generally declining rate environment experienced from through june resulted in the company s adjustable rate loans repricing to lower levels following each rate cut 
another factor affecting the company s net interest margin over the past two years has been an increased reliance on time deposit greater than  and borrowings 
time deposits greater than  and borrowings are generally the highest cost sources of funds for the company and their increased usage has been necessary to fund high loan growth that has exceeded core retail deposit growth 
the ratio of the average amount of time deposits greater than  and borrowings to total funding total deposits plus borrowings increased from in  to in  to in in the second half of  the federal reserve increased interest rates by a total of basis points  which was largely responsible for the company s net interest margin increasing for each of last two quarters of  rising from in the second quarter of to in the third quarter of and to in the fourth quarter of see additional information regarding net interest income in the section entitled interest rate risk 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses charged to operations is an amount sufficient to bring the allowance for loan losses to an estimated balance considered appropriate to absorb probable losses inherent in the portfolio 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on the level of loan growth  an evaluation of the portfolio  current economic conditions  historical loan loss experience and other risk factors 
the provision for loan losses recorded by the company did not vary significantly over the past three years  amounting to  in compared to  in and  in internal loan growth was strong for each of those years  amounting to million in both and and million in there was no external acquired loan growth in  while in and there was acquired growth of million and million  respectively  for which a preexisting allocation for loan losses was already in place 
asset quality ratios were stable during each of the three years in the period ended december  see the section entitled allowance for loan losses and loan loss experience below for a more detailed discussion of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance is monitored and analyzed regularly in conjunction with the company s loan analysis and grading program  and adjustments are made to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income noninterest income recorded by the company amounted to  in   in  and  in as shown in table  core noninterest income  which excludes gains and losses from sales of securities  loans  and other assets  amounted to  in  a increase from  in the core noninterest income of  was higher than the  recorded in see table and the following discussion for an understanding of the components of noninterest income 
service charges on deposit accounts in amounted to  a increase compared to the  recorded in the amount of  was higher than the amount of  the primary factors that have increased the amount of service charges on deposits have been periodic rate increases  service charges earned from internally generated deposit growth  and service charges earned from acquired deposits 
deposit service charge rates are generally increased per year  while internal growth among deposit transaction accounts was in both and the deposits assumed in the acquisition of the four rbc centura branches on october  generated approximately  in service charges for the full year of compared to  realized during the partial period in subsequent to the acquisition 
this incremental income of  accounted for approximately of the increase in service charges on deposit accounts 
in comparing to  the  realized in from the four rbc centura branches along with the  in deposit service charges realized from ccb subsequent to its january  acquisition date accounted for approximately of the increase in service charges on deposit accounts in the company s income from service charges on deposit accounts in the fourth quarter of was essentially flat when compared to the fourth quarter of  which was a result of a higher customer deposit base  the positive effects of which were offset by the negative impact that higher short term interest rates that occurred in the second half of had on service charges that the company earned from its commercial depositors in the company s commercial account service charge rate structure  commercial depositors are given earnings credits negatively impacting service charges on their average deposit balances that are tied to short term interest rates 
for this reason  the company expects little or no growth in this category of income in other service charges  commissions and fees amounted to  in  a increase from the  earned in the amount of  was higher than the  recorded in this category of noninterest income includes items such as credit card interchange income related to merchants and customers  debit card interchange income  atm charges  safety deposit box rentals  fees from sales of personalized checks  and check cashing fees 
this category of income grew primarily because of increases in these activity related fee services as a result of credit and debit card promotions that increased card use and the overall growth in the company s total customer base  including growth achieved from corporate acquisitions 
fees from presold mortgages amounted to  in  a decrease from the amount of  the amount was a increase from the  recorded in fees from presold mortgages peaked in as a result of a high level of mortgage loan refinancings caused by a very low residential mortgage interest rate environment 
in  the high levels of mortgage loan refinancings slowed because many homeowners had already refinanced their mortgages in previous years  and there was a slight rise in residential mortgage interest rates 
commissions from sales of insurance and financial products amounted to  in   in  and  in this line item includes commissions the company receives from three sources sales of credit insurance associated with new loans  commissions from the sales of investment  annuity  and long term care insurance products  and commissions from the sale of property and casualty insurance 
the following table presents the contribution of each of the three sources to the total amount recognized in this line item in thousands commissions earned from sales of credit insurance sales of investments  annuities  and long term care insurance sales of property and casualty insurance total   the increase in commissions from sales of investments  annuities  and long term care insurance from to is primarily due to the hiring of additional staff in this area during as it relates to commissions earned from the sale of property and casualty insurance  the significant increase in this income in was a result of the acquisition of uwharrie insurance group  which was completed on january  see merger and acquisition activity above for additional discussion 
data processing fees amounted to  in   in  and  in as noted earlier  montgomery data makes its excess data processing capabilities available to area financial institutions for a fee 
at december   the company processed for five area banks 
these fees have increased as a result of an increase in the size and number of transactions generated by those clients 
the company has been notified by three of the five financial institutions that utilize this service that they intend to terminate their contracts with the company effective in the first half of each client is switching to a lower cost service provider 
fees from these three institutions amounted to  in montgomery data intends to continue to market this service to area banks  but does not currently have any near term prospects for additional business 
noninterest income not considered to be core amounted to net gains of  in   in  and  in the net gain of  included securities gains of  which were effected primarily in order to realize current income 
also in  the company sold a former bank branch building that resulted in a gain of approximately  the net gain of  primarily related to securities gains of  effected primarily to realize current income and an  gain from a sale of vacant land located beside one of the company s existing branches 
the net gain of  primarily related to miscellaneous securities gains of  noninterest expenses noninterest expenses for were  compared to  in and  in table presents the components of the company s noninterest expense during the past three years 
based on the recorded amounts noted above  noninterest expenses increased in and in the increases in noninterest expenses over the past two years have occurred in nearly every line item of expense and have been primarily as a result of the significant growth experienced by the company  both internally and by acquisition 
over the past two years  the number of the company s branches has increased from to  and the number of full time equivalent employees has increased from at december  to at december  additionally  from december  to december   the amount of loans outstanding increased and deposits increased 
the incremental expense associated with the january acquisition of ccb was approximately million for each of and the incremental expense associated with the acquisition of the four rbc centura branches in october was approximately  in and million in in  the company s incremental external costs associated with complying section of the sarbanes oxley act amounted to approximately  the company expects to incur an additional  in external costs related to section in the first quarter of and an additional  in the second quarter of the incremental costs relate to higher external audit fees and outside consultant fees 
these amounts do not include the value of the significant internal resources devoted to compliance 
income taxes the provision for income taxes was  in   in  and  in the effective tax rate for was approximately in compared to approximately in each of and the slightly lower effective tax rate in was caused by several factors including higher amounts of state tax exempt income  higher amounts of low income housing investment tax credits  and the reversal of an  tax liability that was recorded in connection with a previous corporate acquisition 
the section below entitled liquidity  commitments  and contingencies contains discussion regarding possible loss exposure related to taxes 
as described in that section  the company plans to discontinue certain elements of the company s operating structure  which is expected to increase the company s effective tax rate from approximately the experienced in recent years to approximately 
if the company s effective tax rate had been in  the company s net income would have been lower by approximately million 
table presents the components of tax expense and the related effective tax rates 
stock based compensation for the three years ended december   the company was not required to record an expense for the value of stock options granted to employees 
as discussed in more detail below in the next to last paragraph of the section entitled current accounting and regulatory matters  a new accounting standard statement r  as defined below will require the company to record the value of stock options as an expense in the income statement beginning july  note k to the consolidated financial statements contains pro forma net income and earnings per share information as if the company applied the fair value recognition provisions required by the new standard 
note k indicates that the company s stock based employee compensation expense would have been   and  for the three years ended december    and  respectively 
the significant increase in expense in compared to and is primarily due to the company granting  employee options in april with immediate vesting under the new standard  expense related to the fair market value of options is recognized when the options vest 
prior to that grant  all previous employee option grants had five year vesting periods vesting each year  and thus the amount of expense related to options was generally spread over the five year vesting period 
the compensation committee of the board of directors of the company granted the april options without any vesting requirements for two reasons the options were granted primarily as a reward for past performance and therefore had already been earned in the view of the committee  and to potentially minimize the impact that any change in accounting standards for stock options could have on future years reported net income 
the company expects that future employee stock option grants will revert to having five year vesting periods 
as noted above  beginning on july   the company will be required to expense  within its income statement  the value of stock option grants that vest from that date forward 
the company currently has outstanding stock options with a fair value of  that will vest on a pro rata basis between july  and december   with  vesting in the third quarter of and  vesting in the fourth quarter of in and  the company s stock based compensation expense related to options currently outstanding will be approximately  and  respectively 
new stock option grants that vest after july  will increase the amount of stock based compensation expense recorded by the company 
except for grants to directors see below  the company cannot estimate the amount of future stock option grants at this time 
in the past  stock option grants to employees have been irregular  generally falling into three categories to attract and retain new employees  to recognize changes in responsibilities of existing employees  and to periodically reward exemplary performance 
as it relates to director stock option grants  the company expects to continue to grant  stock options to each of the company s directors on june of each year until the expiration of the current stock option plan 
in  the amount of pro forma expense associated with the director grants was  analysis of financial condition and changes in financial condition overview over the past two years  the company has achieved high increases in its levels of loans and deposits through a combination of internal growth and growth from acquisitions 
the following table presents information regarding the nature of the company s growth in and balance at balance at total percentage growth  in thousands beginning internal growth from end of percentage excluding of period growth acquisitions period growth acquisitions loans    deposits noninterest bearing    deposits savings  now  and money market    deposits time     deposits time     total deposits    loans     deposits noninterest bearing     deposits savings  now  and money market     deposits time      deposits time      total deposits     as shown in the table above  the company experienced high internal growth in loans in and with internal growth of and  respectively 
growth from acquisitions increased the loan growth rate in to 
deposits increased in and in in  of the million in growth in the category deposits time  million related to brokered deposits that the company attracted in order to fund the strong loan growth experienced 
excluding the brokered deposits  the company s deposit growth in was 
in  internal deposit growth was  with deposits assumed in acquisitions boosting total deposit growth from to the company believes the significantly higher internal growth rates for loans compared to deposits over the past two years is largely attributable to the type of customers the company has been able to attract 
most of the company s loan growth has come from small business customers that need loans in order to expand their business  and have few deposits 
additionally  the company has found it difficult to compete for retail deposits in recent years 
the company frequently competes against banks in the marketplace that either are so large that they enjoy better economies of scale over the company and can thus offer higher rates  or are recently started banks that are focused on building market share  and not necessarily positive earnings  by offering high deposit rates 
the company enjoys advantages in the loan marketplace by having seasoned lenders in place that have the experience necessary to oversee the completion of a loan and the autonomy to be able to make timely decisions 
with loan growth exceeding deposit growth over each of the past two years  the company s liquidity has been reduced 
the company increased its borrowings from million at december  to million at december  to million at december  in order to help fund the excess loan growth 
additionally  the company entered the brokered deposit market for the first time in and gathered million in brokered deposits to help fund loan growth 
in  regulatory capital ratios declined slightly as asset growth exceeded capital growth 
in and  as a result of the negative impact that acquisition growth had on the company s regulatory capital ratios  the company raised capital in each of the fourth quarters of and by issuing million each year for a total of million in trust preferred debt securities  which qualify as regulatory capital for the company 
all of the company s capital ratios have significantly exceeded the minimum regulatory thresholds for all periods covered by this report 
although the company s market area  the central piedmont region of north carolina  has experienced recessionary times over most of the past several years  the company s asset quality ratios have remained fairly stable over the past three years with net charge offs to average loans ranging from basis points to basis points and nonperforming assets to total assets ranging from basis points to basis points 
distribution of assets and liabilities table sets forth the percentage relationships of significant components of the company s balance sheets at december    and the relative size of the components of the balance sheet has not varied significantly over the past two years with loans comprising of total assets and deposits comprising 
the most significant variance in table is the increase in in the percentage of time deposits of  or more  which increased from at december  to at december  the company aggressively attracted large time deposits in  including gathering the million in brokered deposits  in order to help fund the strong loan growth experienced that was not able to be fully funded with core retail deposits 
securities information regarding the company s securities portfolio as of december    and is presented in tables and the composition of the investment securities portfolio reflects the company s investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of income 
the investment portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk and credit risk in other categories of the balance sheet while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds  furnishing liquidity  and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits 
total securities available for sale and held to maturity amounted to million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
the decrease in securities from december  to december  was primarily attributable to called and maturing bonds  as well as a high level of principal repayments on mortgage backed securities due to the low interest rate environment 
instead of reinvesting the maturities paydowns back into securities  the proceeds were used to fund loan growth 
the increase in securities available for sale from december  to december  was primarily attributable to securities purchased with a portion of the million in funds received from the october rbc centura branch purchase 
the mix of the types of the company s securities was similar at december  compared to december  in comparing to  the mix of securities changed in due to the mix of new securities purchased with a portion of the million in funds received in the acquisition of the four rbc centura branches 
the company purchased primarily us government agency securities with these funds in order to assure a portfolio mix consistent with the company s investment policy  which limits the amount of mortgage backed securities and corporate bonds in which the company can invest 
the majority of the company s us government agency debt securities are issued by the federal home loan bank and carry one maturity date  often with an issuer call feature  while the mortgage backed securities have been primarily issued by freddie mac and fannie mae and vary in their repayment in correlation with the underlying pools of home mortgage loans 
the company s investment in corporate bonds is primarily comprised of trust preferred securities issued by other north carolina bank holding companies 
included in mortgage backed securities at december  were collateralized mortgage obligations cmos with an amortized cost of  and a fair value of  included in mortgage backed securities at december  were cmos with an amortized cost of  and a fair value of  included in mortgage backed securities at december  were cmos with an amortized cost of  and a fair value of  the cmos that the company has invested in are substantially all early tranche portions of the cmos  which minimizes long term interest rate risk to the company 
at december   a net unrealized gain of  was included in the carrying value of securities classified as available for sale  compared to a net unrealized gain of  at december  and a net unrealized gain of  at december  the lower unrealized gain position at december  compared to december  was caused primarily by a higher interest rate environment in effect at year end compared to year end higher interest rates negatively impact the value of fixed income securities 
another factor was the company s sale of a portion of its bond portfolio that had unrealized gains at december  the increase in the unrealized gain position from to was a result of the lower interest rate environment in effect at year end compared to year end management evaluated any unrealized losses on individual securities at each year end and determined them to be of a temporary nature and caused by fluctuations in market interest rates  not by concerns about the ability of the issuers to meet their obligations 
net unrealized gains  net of applicable deferred income taxes  of   and  have been reported as part of a separate component of shareholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income as of december    and  respectively 
the fair value of securities held to maturity  which the company carries at amortized cost  was more than the carrying value at december  and by  and  respectively 
management evaluated any unrealized losses on individual securities at each year end and determined them to be of a temporary nature and caused by fluctuations in market interest rates  not by concerns about the ability of the issuers to meet their obligations 
table provides detail as to scheduled contractual maturities and book yields on securities available for sale and securities held to maturity at december  mortgage backed and other amortizing securities are shown maturing in the time periods consistent with their estimated lives based on expected prepayment speeds 
the weighted average taxable equivalent yield for the securities available for sale portfolio was at december  the expected weighted average life of the available for sale portfolio using the call date for above market callable bonds  the maturity date for all other non mortgage backed securities  and the expected life for mortgage backed securities  was years 
the weighted average taxable equivalent yield for the securities held to maturity portfolio was at december  the expected weighted average life of the held to maturity portfolio using the call date for above market callable bonds and the maturity date for all other securities  was years 
as of december  and  the company held no investment securities of any one issuer  other than us treasury and us government agencies or corporations  in which aggregate book values and market values exceeded of shareholders equity 
loans table provides a summary of the loan portfolio composition at each of the past five year ends 
the loan portfolio is the largest category of the company s earning assets and is comprised of commercial loans  real estate mortgage loans  real estate construction loans  and consumer loans 
the company restricts virtually all of its lending to its county market area  which is located in the central piedmont region of north carolina  three counties in virginia and one county in south carolina 
the diversity of the region s economic base has historically provided a stable lending environment 
in  loans outstanding increased million  or  to billion 
all of the loan growth in was internally generated  as the company did not complete any acquisitions during the year 
in  loans outstanding increased million  or  to billion 
approximately million of the growth was from net internal loan growth  while million was assumed in acquisitions 
the majority of the and loan growth occurred in loans secured by real estate  with approximately million  or in  and million  or  in of the net loan growth occurring in real estate mortgage or real estate construction loans 
over the years  the company s loan mix has remained fairly consistent  with real estate loans mortgage and construction comprising approximately of the loan portfolio  commercial  financial  and agricultural loans comprising  and consumer installment loans comprising approximately of the portfolio 
at december   billion  or  of the company s loan portfolio was secured by liens on real property 
included in this total are million  or of total loans  in loans secured by liens on family residential properties and million  or of total loans  in loans secured by liens on other types of real estate 
at december   billion  or  of the company s loan portfolio was secured by liens on real property 
included in this total are million  or of total loans  in loans secured by liens on family residential properties and million  or of total loans  in loans secured by liens on other types of real estate 
the company s billion in real estate mortgage loans at december  can be further classified as follows for comparison purposes  the classification of the company s billion real estate loan portfolio at december  is shown in parenthesis o million  or of total loans vs 
million  or of total loans  are traditional residential mortgage loans in which the borrower s personal income is the primary repayment source 
o million  or of total loans vs 
million  or of total loans  are primarily dependent on cash flow from a commercial business for repayment 
o million  or of total loans vs 
million  or of total loans  are real estate construction loans 
o million  or of total loans vs

o million  or of total loans vs 
million  or of total loans  are primarily dependent on cash flow from agricultural crop sales 
table provides a summary of scheduled loan maturities over certain time periods  with fixed rate loans and adjustable rate loans shown separately 
approximately of the company s loans outstanding at december  mature within one year and of total loans mature within five years 
the percentages of variable rate loans and fixed rate loans as compared to total performing loans were and  respectively  as of december  the company intentionally makes a blend of fixed and variable rate loans so as to reduce interest rate risk 
as noted in the section above entitled net interest income  the company has experienced a significant shift in its loan mix over the past two years from fixed rate loans to variable rate loans 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans  loans past due or more days and still accruing interest  restructured loans and other real estate 
as a matter of policy the company places all loans that are past due or more days on nonaccrual basis  and thus there were no loans at any of the past five year ends that were days past due and still accruing interest 
table summarizes the company s nonperforming assets at the dates indicated 
nonaccrual loans are loans on which interest income is no longer being recognized or accrued because management has determined that the collection of interest is doubtful 
placing loans on nonaccrual status negatively impacts earnings because i interest accrued but unpaid as of the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is either deducted from interest income or is charged off  ii future accruals of interest income are not recognized until it becomes probable that both principal and interest will be paid and iii principal charged off  if appropriate  may necessitate additional provisions for loan losses that are charged against earnings 
in some cases  where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties  loans may be restructured to provide terms significantly different from the originally contracted terms 
nonperforming loans which includes nonaccrual loans and restructured loans as of december   and totaled   and  respectively 
nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans amounted to   and  at december    and  respectively 
the variances in nonperforming loans over the past two years have been primarily due to changes in nonaccrual loans  as restructured loans have not changed significantly 
the increase in nonaccrual loans from december  to december  related primarily to five loans totaling  placed on nonaccrual basis during the year 
each of these unrelated loans had an outstanding loan balance of between  and  and each loan was secured by real estate 
each of the five loans was removed from nonaccrual status in without material loss to the company 
three of the five loans were liquidated  while the other two loans were foreclosed upon and the collateral transferred to other real estate 
the decrease in nonaccrual loans from to was also impacted by the resolution of the company s largest nonaccrual loan relationship during this nonaccrual relationship amounted to  at december  in  the loan was reduced to zero through a combination of payments received  property foreclosures  and charge offs 
in total  the company received payments of  foreclosed on property with a value of  and charged off the remaining balance of  the company s largest nonaccrual relationship at december  amounted to  if the nonaccrual loans and restructured loans as of december   and had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination if held for part of the period  gross interest income in the amounts of approximately   and  for nonaccrual loans and   and  for restructured loans would have been recorded for  and  respectively 
interest income on such loans that was actually collected and included in net income in  and amounted to approximately   and  for nonaccrual loans prior to their being placed on nonaccrual status and   and  for restructured loans  respectively 
management routinely monitors the status of certain large loans that  in management s opinion  have credit weaknesses that could cause them to become nonperforming loans 
in addition to the nonperforming loan amounts discussed above  management believes that an estimated million of loans that were performing in accordance with their contractual terms at december  have the potential to develop problems depending upon the particular financial situations of the borrowers and economic conditions in general 
management has taken these potential problem loans into consideration when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at december  see discussion below 
loans classified for regulatory purposes as loss  doubtful  substandard  or special mention that have not been disclosed in the problem loan amounts and the potential problem loan amounts discussed above do not represent or result from trends or uncertainties that management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results  liquidity  or capital resources  or represent material credits about which management is aware of any information that causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms 
other real estate includes foreclosed  repossessed  and idled properties 
other real estate has not varied materially at any of the past three year ends  amounting to  at december    at december   and  at december  other real estate represented   and of total assets at the end of   and  respectively 
the company s management believes that the fair values of the items of other real estate  less estimated costs to sell  equal or exceed their respective carrying values at the dates presented 
allowance for loan losses and loan loss experience the allowance for loan losses is created by direct charges to operations 
losses on loans are charged against the allowance in the period in which such loans  in management s opinion  become uncollectible 
the recoveries realized during the period are credited to this allowance 
the company considers its procedures for recording the amount of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy 
see the heading critical accounting policies above for further discussion 
the factors that influence management s judgment in determining the amount charged to operating expense include past loan loss experience  composition of the loan portfolio  evaluation of probable inherent losses and current economic conditions 
the company uses a loan analysis and grading program to facilitate its evaluation of probable inherent loan losses and the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses 
in this program  risk grades are assigned by management and tested by the company s internal audit department and an independent third party consulting firm 
the testing program includes an evaluation of a sample of new loans  loans that management identifies as having potential credit weaknesses  loans past due days or more  nonaccrual loans and any other loans identified during previous regulatory and other examinations 
the company strives to maintain its loan portfolio in accordance with what management believes are conservative loan underwriting policies that result in loans specifically tailored to the needs of the company s market areas 
every effort is made to identify and minimize the credit risks associated with such lending strategies 
the company has no foreign loans  few agricultural loans and does not engage in significant lease financing or highly leveraged transactions 
commercial loans are diversified among a variety of industries 
the majority of loans captioned in the tables discussed below as real estate loans are primarily various personal and commercial loans where real estate provides additional security for the loan 
collateral for virtually all of these loans is located within the company s principal market area 
the allowance for loan losses amounted to  at december  compared to  as of december  and  at december  this represented   and  of loans outstanding as of december    and  respectively 
as noted in table  the company s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans coverage ratio amounted to at december   compared to at december  and at december  due to the secured nature of virtually all of the company s loans that are on nonaccrual status  the variance in the coverage ratio is not necessarily indicative of the relative adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses at the dates indicated 
the portion of these reserves that was allocated to specific loan types in the loan portfolio increased to  at december  from  at december  and  at december  the increase in the amount of the allocated allowance during is consistent with the increase in total loans outstanding during the year 
similarly  the increase in the amount of the allocated allowance during is consistent with the increase in total loans outstanding during the year 
in addition to the allocated portion of the allowance for loan losses  the company maintains an unallocated portion that is not assigned to any specific category of loans  but rather is intended to reserve for the inherent risk in the overall portfolio and the intrinsic inaccuracies associated with the estimation of the allowance for loan losses and its allocation to specific loan categories 
the amount of the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses did not vary materially at any of the past three year ends 
management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover probable loan losses on the loans outstanding as of each reporting date 
it must by emphasized  however  that the determination of the allowance using the company s procedures and methods rests upon various judgments and assumptions about economic conditions and other factors affecting loans 
no assurance can be given that the company will not in any particular period sustain loan losses that are sizable in relation to the amount reserved or that subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio  in light of conditions and factors then prevailing  will not require significant changes in the allowance for loan losses or future charges to earnings 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowances for loan losses and losses on foreclosed real estate 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowances based on the examiners judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
for the years indicated  table summarizes the company s balances of loans outstanding  average loans outstanding  and a detailed rollforward of the allowance for loan losses 
in addition to the increases to the allowance for loan losses related to normal provisions  the increases in the dollar amounts of the allowance for loan losses in and were also affected by amounts recorded to provide for loans assumed in corporate acquisitions 
in  the company recorded  to the allowance for loan losses related to loans assumed in two corporate acquisitions 
approximately  of the  related to million in loans assumed in the october rbc centura branch acquisition  while  related to the ccb acquisition 
the  addition related to ccb represented the book value of ccb s allowance for loan losses on the date of the acquisition 
in   was recorded for loans assumed in the broadway branch acquisition in which the company assumed approximately million in loans 
the company s net loan charge offs amounted to  in   in  and  in this represents   and of average loans during   and respectively 
the slightly higher amount of net charge offs in is largely attributable to the  charge off recorded in related to the disposition of a large nonaccrual relationship that is discussed above in the section entitled nonperforming assets 
deposits at december   deposits outstanding amounted to billion  an increase of million  or  from december  in  deposits grew from billion to billion  an increase of million  or 
although all of the deposit growth in was internally generated the company did not complete any acquisitions during the year  approximately million of the increase related to wholesale brokered deposits that the company gathered in order to help fund the high loan growth experienced during prior to  the company had never utilized brokered deposits 
in  million of the million increase in deposits was related to acquisitions the company s january acquisition of ccb with million in deposits and the october acquisition of four rbc centura branches with million in deposits 
the nature of the company s deposit growth is illustrated in the table on page the following table reflects the mix of the company s deposits at each of the past three year ends noninterest bearing deposits savings  now and money market deposits time deposits  time deposits  total deposits the slight shift in to from time deposits less than  to noninterest bearing deposits was primarily the result of the mix of the deposits acquired in  which had a high concentration of noninterest bearing deposits 
in  there was a significant increase in the percentage of time deposits greater than  the increase in this category was largely a result of the company offering competitive interest rates on this product and the million in wholesale brokered deposits gathered by the company 
both of the factors driving the increase in time deposits greater than  were necessitated by the combination of strong loan growth and modest core retail deposit growth experienced by the company in as noted earlier  competition for deposits in the company s market area is strong 
table presents the average amounts of deposits of the company and the average yield paid for those deposits for the years ended december    and as of december   the company held approximately million in time deposits of  or more 
table is a maturity schedule of time deposits of  or more as of december  this table shows that of the company s time deposits greater than  mature within one year 
at each of the past three year ends  the company had no deposits issued through foreign offices  nor did the company believe that it held any deposits by foreign depositors 
borrowings the company had borrowings outstanding of million at december  compared to million at december  as shown in table  average borrowings has increased over the past two years  amounting to million in  million in  and rising to million in the increases in borrowings over the past two years has been necessary for two reasons to help fund the company s high loan growth which has exceeded deposit growth and to enhance the company s regulatory capital ratios as noted below  the company s trust preferred security borrowings qualify as tier i capital for regulatory capital adequacy requirements 
at december   the company has three sources of readily available borrowing capacity an approximately million line of credit with the fhlb  of which million was outstanding at december  and million was outstanding at december   a million overnight federal funds line of credit with a correspondent bank  none of which was outstanding at december  or  and an approximately million line of credit through the federal reserve bank of richmond s frb discount window  none of which was outstanding at december  or the company s line of credit with the fhlb totaling approximately million can be structured as either short term or long term borrowings  depending on the particular funding or liquidity need and is secured by the company s fhlb stock and a blanket lien on most of its real estate loan portfolio 
the company had million outstanding under this line of credit at december   with million outstanding on an overnight basis and the other million maturing in million to million increments in each of the years from to the company s correspondent bank relationship allows the company to purchase up to million in federal funds on an overnight  unsecured basis 
the company had no borrowings outstanding under this line at december  or this line of credit was not drawn upon during any of the past three years 
the company also has a line of credit with the frb discount window 
this line is secured by a blanket lien on a portion of the company s commercial and consumer loan portfolio excluding real estate 
based on the collateral owned by the company as of december   the available line of credit is approximately million 
this line of credit was established primarily in connection with the company s yk liquidity contingency plan and has not been drawn on since inception 
the frb has indicated that it would not expect lines of credit that have been granted to financial institutions to be a primary borrowing source 
the company plans to maintain this line of credit  although it is not expected that it will be drawn upon except in unusual circumstances 
in addition to the lines of credit described above  in which the company had million outstanding as of december   the company also had a total of million in trust preferred security debt outstanding at december  the company issued million of this debt on october  and an additional million on december  these borrowings each have year final maturities and were structured as trust preferred capital securities that qualify as tier i capital for regulatory capital adequacy requirements 
these debt securities are callable by the company at par on any quarterly interest payment date five years after their issue date 
the interest rate on these debt securities adjusts on a quarterly basis at a rate of three month libor plus for the securities issued in and three month libor plus for the securities issued in average short term borrowings for each of the past five years were less than of total shareholders equity at all times during each period 
liquidity  commitments  and contingencies the company s liquidity is determined by its ability to convert assets to cash or to acquire alternative sources of funds to meet the needs of its customers who are withdrawing or borrowing funds  and its ability to maintain required reserve levels  pay expenses and operate the company on an ongoing basis 
the company s primary liquidity sources are net income from operations  cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and other short term investments 
the company s securities portfolio is comprised almost entirely of readily marketable securities which could also be sold to provide cash 
as noted above  in addition to internally generated liquidity sources  the company has the ability to obtain borrowings from the following three sources an approximately million line of credit with the fhlb  a million overnight federal funds line of credit with a correspondent bank  and an approximately million line of credit through the federal reserve bank of richmond s discount window 
the company s on balance sheet liquidity declined in both and as a result of the strong loan growth that outpaced deposit growth during each year 
the imbalance in loan growth compared to deposit growth increased the loan to deposit ratio from at december  to at december  to at december  the increasing loan to deposit ratio has resulted in the company relying more heavily on borrowings during each of the past two years in order to achieve internally targeted liquidity ratios 
average borrowings outstanding were million in  million in and million in despite the higher reliance on borrowings  the company s management believes its liquidity sources  including unused lines of credit  are at an acceptable level and remain adequate to meet its operating needs in the foreseeable future 
the company will continue to monitor its liquidity position carefully and will explore and implement strategies to increase liquidity if deemed appropriate in the normal course of business there are various outstanding contractual obligations of the company that will require future cash outflows 
in addition  there are commitments and contingent liabilities  such as commitments to extend credit  that may or may not require future cash outflows 
table reflects the contractual obligations and other commercial commitments of the company outstanding as of december  any of the company s million in outstanding borrowings with the fhlb may be accelerated immediately by the fhlb in certain circumstances  including material adverse changes in the condition of the company or if the company s qualifying collateral amounts to less than times the amount of borrowings outstanding 
at december   the company s qualifying collateral amounted to times the amount of borrowings outstanding 
in the normal course of business there are various outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities  such as commitments to extend credit  which are not reflected in the financial statements 
table also reflects other commercial commitments of the company outstanding as of december  this table reflects that as of december   the company had outstanding loan commitments of  the sum of credit cards and lines of credit and loan commitments line items 
of that amount   were at variable rates and  were at fixed rates 
included in outstanding loan commitments were unfunded commitments of  on revolving credit plans  of which  were at variable rates and  were at fixed rates 
in addition to the credit card and other loan commitments described above  at december  and  the company had  and  in standby letters of credit outstanding  respectively 
the company has no carrying amount for these standby letters of credit 
the nature of the standby letters of credit is a guarantee made on behalf the company s customers to suppliers of the customers to guarantee payments owed to the supplier by the customer 
the standby letters of credit have two to three year terms  and the payment of the guarantees would generally be triggered by a continued nonpayment of an obligation owed by the customer to the supplier 
the maximum potential amount of future payments undiscounted the company could be required to make under the guarantees in the event of nonperformance by the parties to whom credit or financial guarantees have been extended is represented by the contractual amount of the financial instruments discussed above 
in the event that the company is required to honor a standby letter of credit  a note  already executed with the customer  is triggered which provides repayment terms and any collateral requirements 
over the past ten years  the company has had to honor one standby letter of credit  which was repaid by the borrower without any loss to the company 
it has been the experience of the company that deposit withdrawals are generally replaced with new deposits  thus not requiring any net cash outflow 
based on that assumption  management believes that it can meet its contractual cash obligations and existing commitments from normal operations 
the company is not involved in any legal proceedings that  in management s opinion  could have a material effect on the consolidated financial position of the company  however  the following paragraph describes a potential exposure related to taxes 
based on consultations with the company s tax advisors  the company s organizational structure has been established in a way to minimize its tax liabilities 
state taxing authorities have recently announced that they will vigorously pursue taxpayers who have engaged in activities deemed to be income shifting  and the company is aware that state taxing authorities have recently challenged a bank holding company with a similar operating structure as the company that they deem to result in income shifting 
while the company believes its tax position is sound  it has decided to discontinue certain elements of its operating structure during to avoid controversy with state taxing authorities 
if the company s position with regard to its operating structure were to be challenged by state taxing authorities for past years and resulted in an assessment  the company estimates that its exposure could be million net of federal tax benefit  including interest and penalties 
if such an assessment were to occur  the company would vigorously contest the assessment based on the belief that it has fully complied with relevant tax laws 
accordingly  the company has not accrued a liability for this possibility 
as a result of discontinuing certain elements of the company s operating structure  the company estimates that its effective tax rate will increase from approximately in to approximately in if the company s effective tax rate had been in  the company s net income would have been lower by approximately million 
off balance sheet arrangements and derivative financial instruments off balance sheet arrangements include transactions  agreements  or other contractual arrangements in which the company has obligations or provides guarantees on behalf of an unconsolidated entity 
the company has no off balance sheet arrangements of this kind other than repayment guarantees associated with its trust preferred securities 
derivative financial instruments include futures  forwards  interest rate swaps  options contracts  and other financial instruments with similar characteristics 
the company has not engaged in significant derivatives activities through december  and has no current plans to do so 
interest rate risk including quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk item a 
net interest income is the company s most significant component of earnings 
notwithstanding changes in volumes of loans and deposits  the company s level of net interest income is continually at risk due to the effect that changes in general market interest rate trends have on interest yields earned and paid with respect to the various categories of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
it is the company s policy to maintain portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities with maturities and repricing opportunities that will afford protection  to the extent practical  against wide interest rate fluctuations 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is analyzed on a regular basis by management using standard gap reports  maturity reports  and an asset liability software model that simulates future levels of interest income and expense based on current interest rates  expected future interest rates  and various intervals of shock interest rates 
over the years  the company has been able to maintain a fairly consistent yield on average earning assets net interest margin 
over the past five calendar years the company s net interest margin has ranged from a low of realized in to a high of realized in 
during that five year period the prime rate of interest has ranged from a low of to a high of table sets forth the company s interest rate sensitivity analysis as of december   using stated maturities for all instruments except mortgage backed securities which are allocated in the periods of their expected payback and securities and borrowings with call features that are expected to be called which are shown in the period of their expected call 
as illustrated by this table  at december   the company had million more in interest bearing liabilities that are subject to interest rate changes within one year than earning assets 
this generally would indicate that net interest income would experience downward pressure in a rising interest rate environment and would benefit from a declining interest rate environment 
however  this method of analyzing interest sensitivity only measures the magnitude of the timing differences and does not address earnings  market value  or management actions 
also  interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
in addition to the effects of when various rate sensitive products reprice  market rate changes may not result in uniform changes in rates among all products 
for example  included in interest bearing liabilities subject to interest rate changes within one year at december  are deposits totaling million comprised of now  savings  and certain types of money market deposits with interest rates set by management 
these types of deposits historically have not repriced coincidentally with or in the same proportion as general market indicators 
thus  the company believes that in the near term twelve months  net interest income would not likely experience significant downward pressure from rising interest rates 
similarly  management would not expect a significant increase in near term net interest income from falling interest rates in fact  it has been the company s experience that each interest rate cut occurring during the past three years has negatively impacted at least temporarily the company s net interest margin 
generally  when rates change  the company s interest sensitive assets that are subject to adjustment reprice immediately at the full amount of the change  while the company s interest sensitive liabilities that are subject to adjustment reprice at a lag to the rate change and typically not to the full extent of the rate change 
the net effect is that in the twelve month horizon  as rates change  the impact of having a higher level of interest sensitive liabilities is substantially negated by the later and typically lower proportionate change these liabilities experience compared to interest sensitive assets 
however  the rate cuts totaling basis points that occurred in late and mid had a more pronounced and a longer lasting negative impact on the company s net interest margin than previous rate cuts because of the inability of the company to reset deposit rates by an amount because of their already near zero rates that would offset the negative impact of the rate cut on the yields earned on the company s interest earning assets 
additionally  as previously discussed  over the past two years  the company has originated significantly more adjustable rate loans compared to fixed rate loans 
adjustable rate loans generally carry lower initial interest rates than fixed rate loans 
for these reasons  the second quarter of marked the fifth consecutive quarter of declining net interest margins 
in the second half of  the federal reserve increased interest rates three times totaling basis points  which was largely responsible for the company s net interest margin reversing its downward trend and increasing from in the second quarter of to in the third quarter of and to in the fourth quarter of assuming no changes in interest rates in  the company would expect  as discussed above  its net interest margin to be negatively impacted as a result of time deposits maturing and repricing in that were originated in periods when rates were lower 
however  many economists have stated that they believe that interest rates will continue to rise in  and in fact the federal reserve raised interest rates by in february if rates were to increase in by approximately  the company expects that the negative impact of higher rates paid on maturing time deposits would be largely negated by increases in yields on earning assets  and that the company s net interest margin for the year will be continue to be in the recently realized range of 
however in determining this range  the company had to make certain assumptions about its ability to manage changes in rates paid on deposits  which will depend largely on actions taken by the company s competitors and could be significantly different from the assumptions made

return on assets and equity table shows return on assets net income divided by average total assets  return on equity net income divided by average shareholders equity  dividend payout ratio dividends per share divided by net income per share and shareholders equity to assets ratio average shareholders equity divided by average total assets for each of the years in the three year period ended december  capital resources and shareholders equity shareholders equity at december  amounted to million compared to million at december  the two basic components that typically have the largest impact on the company s shareholders equity are net income  which increases shareholders equity  and dividends declared  which decreases shareholders equity 
in  net income of  increased equity  while dividends declared of  reduced equity 
also  the company continued to actively manage its capital and number of common shares outstanding through stock repurchases 
in  the company repurchased a total of  shares of its common stock at an average price of  which reduced shareholders equity by million 
at december   the company had a remaining authorization from its board of directors to repurchase  shares of stock 
as discussed below  the company expects to repurchase fewer shares of stock in than it did in in order to prudently manage its capital ratios 
other items affecting shareholders equity in were proceeds of  received from common stock issued as a result of stock option exercises  proceeds of  received from the issuance of stock into the company s dividend reinvestment plan  a  increase to equity related to the tax benefit that the company realized due to exercises of nonqualified stock options  and other comprehensive loss of  which was comprised of the  decrease in the net unrealized gain  net of taxes  of the company s available for sale securities and an adjustment to the company s pension liability of  net of taxes 
in  net income of  increased equity  while dividends declared of  reduced equity 
two other items significantly impacted shareholders equity in in connection with the company s acquisition of ccb in january  the company issued shares of stock for each share of ccb stock outstanding  which resulted in the company issuing a total of  shares of stock valued at million  which increased shareholders equity 
also in  the company repurchased a total of  shares of its common stock at an average price of  which reduced shareholders equity by million

the company is not aware of any recommendations of regulatory authorities or otherwise which  if they were to be implemented  would have a material effect on its liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
the company and the bank must comply with regulatory capital requirements established by the frb and the fdic 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory  and possibly additional discretionary  actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the company s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company and the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the company s assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the company s and bank s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
these capital standards require the company and the bank to maintain minimum ratios of tier capital to total risk weighted assets tier i capital ratio and total capital to risk weighted assets total capital ratio of and  respectively 
tier capital is comprised of total shareholders equity  excluding unrealized gains or losses from the securities available for sale  less intangible assets  and total capital is comprised of tier capital plus certain adjustments  the largest of which for the company and the bank is the allowance for loan losses 
risk weighted assets refer to the on and off balance sheet exposures of the company and the bank  adjusted for their related risk levels using formulas set forth in frb and fdic regulations 
in addition to the risk based capital requirements described above  the company and the bank are subject to a leverage capital requirement  which calls for a minimum ratio of tier capital as defined above to quarterly average total assets leverage ratio of to  depending upon the institution s composite ratings as determined by its regulators 
the frb has not advised the company of any requirement specifically applicable to it 
table presents the company s regulatory capital ratios as of december    and in  as a result of the company forecasting that its strategic growth goals would likely result in the need for additional capital  the company issued million in debt structured as trust preferred capital securities that qualify as capital for regulatory capital adequacy requirements see borrowings above for further discussion 
as a result of the issuance of the trust preferred securities  the company s capital ratios increased significantly at december  compared to december  in  although the company s regulatory capital ratios at all times far exceeded regulatory minimums  the ratios decreased significantly as a result of the company s acquisitions  which increased assets and decreased tangible capital 
the company s issuance of an additional million in trust preferred securities in december partially offset the decrease in regulatory capital ratios resulting from the effects of the acquisitions 
in  the company s regulatory capital ratios declined slightly due to assets growing at a higher rate than did the company s equity 
assuming similar growth rates in  the company expects to repurchase less stock in than in recent years in order to maintain its capital ratios at approximately their same levels 
in addition to the minimum capital requirements described above  the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action also contains specific capital guidelines for a bank s classification as well capitalized 
the specific guidelines are as follows tier i capital ratio of at least  total capital ratio of at least  and a leverage ratio of at least 
the bank s regulatory ratios exceeded the threshold for well capitalized status at december   and the company s goal is to maintain its well capitalized status at all times 
based on the company s capital position at december  and the fact that there are no pending acquisitions or material capital expenditures planned  the company does not anticipate needing to raise capital in the foreseeable future 
the company estimates  based on criteria provided by trust preferred security pool underwriters  that it has the credit capacity to issue approximately million more in trust preferred securities 
the company also believes that it has the ability to raise capital in a secondary stock offering should the need arise 
see supervision and regulation under business above and note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of other matters that may affect the company s capital resources 
inflation because the assets and liabilities of a bank are primarily monetary in nature payable in fixed determinable amounts  the performance of a bank is affected more by changes in interest rates than by inflation 
interest rates generally increase as the rate of inflation increases  but the magnitude of the change in rates may not be the same 
the effect of inflation on banks is normally not as significant as its influence on those businesses that have large investments in plant and inventories 
during periods of high inflation  there are normally corresponding increases in the money supply  and banks will normally experience above average growth in assets  loans and deposits 
also  general increases in the price of goods and services will result in increased operating expenses 
current accounting and regulatory matters the company prepares its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with standards established by  among others  the financial accounting standards board the fasb 
because the information needed by users of financial reports is dynamic  the fasb frequently issues new rules and proposes new rules for companies to apply in reporting their activities 
the following paragraphs contain information regarding recently adopted accounting standards that affected the company and new standards that have not yet been adopted that have the potential to affect the company 
in january  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which was subsequently revised in december fin addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of certain variable interest entities 
the provisions of this interpretation became effective for the company on january  as it relates to variable interest entities created or purchased after that date 
in december  the fasb issued a revision to fin fin r  which clarified and interpreted certain of the provisions of fin  without changing the basic accounting model in fin the provisions of fin r were effective no later than march  the adoption of fin did not have an impact on the company s financial position or results of operations  as the company had no investments in variable interest entities that required consolidation under fin the application of fin r during resulted in the de consolidation of two trusts that the company established in order to issue million in trust preferred capital securities 
the de consolidation of the trusts resulted in the company recording the amount of the junior subordinated debentures between the company and the trust subsidiary in the amount of  previously  the junior subordinated debentures were eliminated in consolidation 
the impact of this change was to increase both securities held to maturity and borrowings by  each 
in november  the fasb ratified a consensus reached by its emerging issues task force eitf regarding quantitative and qualitative disclosures required by eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf issue no 
requires certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures as it relates to investments that have unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments and is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the additional disclosures required for the company are included in note in march  the eitf released consensus eitf 
eitf as released  codified the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
and required additional information about unrealized losses associated with debt and equity securities and also provided more detailed criteria that must be followed in evaluating whether to record losses on impaired debt and equity securities 
the disclosure requirements were applicable for annual reporting periods ending after june  and are presented in note the impairment accounting requirements were to have been effective for periods beginning after june  however  in september  the fasb indefinitely delayed the effective date of the requirement to record impairment losses caused by the effect of increases in interest rates or sector spreads 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised statement r  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
statement r revises employers disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement plans  but does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans 
statement no 
r requires additional disclosures about the assets  obligations  cash flows  and net periodic pension cost of defined benefit plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans 
most of the provisions of statement r became effective for financial statements with fiscal years after december   with certain provisions becoming effective for fiscal years ending after june  the additional disclosures required for the company are included in note in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
in december  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer 
sop provides guidance on the accounting for differences between contractual and expected cash flows from the purchaser s initial investment in loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer  if those differences are attributable  at least in part  to credit quality 
the scope of sop includes loans that have shown evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination  and includes loans acquired individually  in pools or as part of a business combination 
among other things  sop prohibits the recognition of the excess of contractual cash flows over expected cash flows as an adjustment of yield  loss accrual or valuation allowance at the time of purchase  requires that subsequent increases in expected cash flows be recognized prospectively through an adjustment of yield  and requires that subsequent decreases in expected cash flows be recognized as impairment 
in addition  sop prohibits the creation or carrying over of a valuation allowance in the initial accounting of all loans within the scope that are acquired in a transfer 
under sop  the difference between expected cash flows and the purchase price is accreted as an adjustment to yield over the life of the loans 
for loans acquired in a business combination that have shown deterioration of credit quality since origination  sop represents a significant change from the current purchase accounting practice whereby the acquiree s allowance for loan losses is typically added to the acquirer s allowance for loan losses 
sop becomes effective for loans or debt securities acquired in fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin number sab  application of accounting principles to loan commitments 
sab summarizes the views of the sec staff regarding the application of generally accepted accounting principles to loan commitments accounted for as derivatives  and its provisions were required for such loan commitments entered into subsequent to march  the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised statement r  share based payment 
statement r replaces fasb statement no 
statement  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees 
statement  as originally issued in  established as preferable a fair value based method of accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
however  statement permitted entities the option of continuing to apply the guidance in opinion  as long as the footnotes to financial statements disclosed what net income would have been had the preferable fair value based method been used 
statement r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
statement r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
currently  the only share based compensation arrangement utilized by the company is stock options 
the company will be required to apply statement r as of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  see stock based compensation above for further discussion  including the potential quantitative impact of adopting this statement 
in march  the frb issued a final rule concerning the regulatory capital treatment of trust preferred securities tps by bank holding companies 
after a five year transition period ending march   the aggregate amount of tps and certain other capital elements will be limited to of tier i capital elements net of goodwill  less any associated deferred tax liability 
amounts of restricted core capital elements in excess of these limits generally may be included in tier capital 
the company does not expect this rule to materially impact the company s capital ratios

forward looking statements the discussion in part i and part ii of this report contains statements that could be deemed forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of and the private securities litigation reform act  which statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements are statements that include projections  predictions  expectations or beliefs about future events or results or otherwise are not statements of historical fact 
such statements are often characterized by the use of qualifying words and their derivatives such as expect  believe  estimate  plan  project  or other statements concerning opinions or judgment of the company and its management about future events 
factors that could influence the accuracy of such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the financial success or changing strategies of the company s customers  the company s level of success in integrating acquisitions  actions of government regulators  the level of market interest rates  and general economic conditions
