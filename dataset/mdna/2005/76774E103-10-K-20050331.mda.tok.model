item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
business overview we develop  manufacture and market innovative products for cancer patients  including radiofrequency ablation systems for treating cancerous tumors as well as percutaneous vascular and spinal access systems 
in  we commercially launched our starburst xli family of disposable devices and significantly expanded our direct domestic sales organization and our international distribution network 
in  the xli family of disposable devices gained wide acceptance with our customers in the united states 
in  we introduced our next generation in infusion technology  the xli enhanced xlie disposable device 
the xlie device builds upon our established infusion expertise  making the ablation process easier and more efficient 
on july   we completed a merger with horizon medical products  inc horizon operated as a specialty medical device company focused on manufacturing and marketing vascular products  particularly oncology product lines including implantable vascular ports  tunneled catheters and stem cell transplant catheters used in cancer treatment protocols 
each horizon common stockholder received of a share of our common stock for each share of horizon common stock held 
we thereby issued approximately million shares of its common stock to acquire all issued and outstanding shares of horizon common stock  and further assumed all outstanding horizon options and warrants that  upon exercise  will result in the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock 
the fair value of shares we issued was approximately million based on a price per share of  our average closing price the day the proposed merger was announced may   the two business days preceding the announcement and the two business days following the announcement 
the fair value of options and warrants  all of which were fully vested when we assumed them  was determined to be approximately million using the black scholes valuation model 
costs incurred to effect the merger and included as a component of purchase price were million 
the total purchase price was approximately million 
the fair value of assets acquired  net of liabilities assumed  was approximately million  resulting in goodwill of million 
we believe the merger will lead to higher sales and greater profitability than either or both of the pre merger companies on a standalone basis due to a larger  more effective sales group  consolidation of manufacturing resulting in lower product costs  and reduced administrative expenses 
management relies on certain statistical measurements to assess trends in sales growth and the effectiveness of our selling strategies 
the following table  derived from our consolidated statements of operations and other unaudited data for the years ended december   and  sets forth some of these measurements years ended december  total sales in thousands percentage of sales united states percentage of sales international percentage of sales radiofrequency products percentage of sales specialty access catheters gross margin consolidation of horizon s results did not begin until the closing date of the merger  july  therefore  the percentages shown for historical periods are not indicative of future results 
in particular  the percentage of sales attributable to specialty access products is expected to be higher in future years that reflect twelve months of specialty access product results 
prior to completion of the horizon merger  our products were sold in the united states exclusively through our direct sales force and internationally through distribution partners 
horizon  in contrast  made use of domestic distribution partners in selected areas of the united states 
since completion of the merger  we have begun to 
table of contents distribute our radiofrequency ablation products through two of these domestic distribution partners 
however  direct sales will remain our predominant mode of domestic distribution for the foreseeable future 
our sales in the united states are more profitable than our sales in international markets because direct selling  which avoids distributor discounts  permits higher average selling prices for our products 
accordingly  we have made significant investments in our domestic sales force in an effort to increase sales growth in the united states  and we introduced our premium priced starburst xli and xlie families of disposable needles in this region earlier than in europe or other regions 
these actions have resulted in a growing percentage of sales derived from the domestic market 
the merger with horizon should permit wider and even more efficient coverage of the domestic market  further strengthening this trend 
in contrast  our international markets in europe and japan have relatively more restrictive reimbursement conditions than those in the united states  which combined with our distributor discounts  limit our average selling prices in these markets 
we expect sales growth in the united states to continue to outpace international growth because we believe the principle impact of the horizon merger will be upon the domestic market and because introduction of premium products to our international distributors will have a relatively small impact on growth due to pricing limitations 
prior to completion of the horizon merger  essentially all of our sales came from the sale of our disposable devices and radiofrequency generators used in the treatment of cancerous liver tumors 
the merger with horizon expanded our product offering and has resulted in additional sales  primarily from the specialty access catheter and port product lines used in cancer treatment protocols 
going forward  we expect that nearly of our sales will be derived from our rfa and sac disposable products  with the balance of our sales coming from hardware products 
during the third quarter of  integration of the two sales groups required training that adversely impacted sales growth 
however  sales in the fourth quarter of returned to historically normal rates 
we believe that in the broader product line and larger sales group resulting from the merger will enable us to increase the efficiency of our selling effort 
our manufacturing costs consist of raw materials  including generators and ancillary hardware components produced for us by third party suppliers  labor to produce our disposable devices and to inspect incoming  in process and finished goods  sterilization performed by an outside service provider and general overhead expenses 
our manufacturing costs are volume dependent  and our unit costs should decrease as our production volumes increase 
the ongoing integration of our manufacturing operations in our manchester  georgia location should result in lower costs in the future from the use of less expensive labor and economies of scale 
we also believe we have the opportunity to reduce the cost of our vendor supplied hardware products through higher order volumes or product redesign 
besides manufacturing costs  our cost of goods sold for and reflects amortization of intangible assets relating to product technology acquired in the merger and the settlement of patent litigation 
we expect these amortization charges to continue through further  our cost of goods sold also includes provisions to our reserve for obsolete inventory 
technology in our marketplace has evolved rapidly and we have  from time to time  recognized relatively high expenses related to obsolete inventory as our product line has changed 
we may experience similar product changes and related obsolete inventory provisions in the future 
our gross margins reflect our selling prices  our domestic international mix percentages  our product mix percentages  our production volumes  the costs we pay for vendor manufactured product and our provisions for obsolete inventory 
our gross margin for the was  compared to a gross margin of 
historically  the gross margin rate for our specialty access catheter products has been lower than that of our radiofrequency ablation products 
also  amortization of our product technology related intangible assets will negatively impact cost of goods sold 
we expect that our future gross margins will be somewhat lower than our historical gross margin rates because of inclusion of these products and expenses in our results 

table of contents in addition to the selling statistics discussed above  management relies on certain measurements to assess the effectiveness of our operations 
the following tables sets forth some of these measurements  derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the three years ended december   and and our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and years ended december  research and development expense selling  general and administrative expense restructuring charges total operating expenses december  cash and cash equivalents marketable securities  current and long term total cash and marketable securities if we are to become profitable  we must continue to manage our operating expenses 
our operating expenses consist of product development costs  clinical trial expenses  patent litigation expenses  sales and marketing expenses related to our selling efforts in the united states  europe and asia  and administrative expenses  including the costs associated with our status as a public company  professional service expenses and our provisions for uncollectible accounts 
changes in these expenses are determined by the breadth of our new product development portfolio  the number of headcount we maintain in our selling and administrative functions  the scope of our marketing efforts  the costs we incur in defense of our patents and intellectual property rights and the extent to which credit issues and economic conditions constrain our ability to collect our receivables 
research spending in was million  or lower than in research spending in is expected to increase modestly  driven by programs aimed at technical innovation of our radiofrequency ablation products and the introduction of new implantable ports and access catheters 
selling  general and administrative in was million  about million higher than in the primary reasons for the increase were the consolidation of horizon results and expenses incurred in the integration of the two companies 
also  the merger resulted in recognition of intangible assets relating to trademarks  customer relationships and our distribution contract with medtronic  amortization of which will result in charges to selling  general and administrative expense of million to million per year through we further note significant costs related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of however  headcount reductions  particularly in the domestic sales groups  were begun in the third quarter of these headcount reductions should result in expense levels for the combined company lower than the sum of expenses for the two companies prior to the merger 
we incurred restructuring expenses of million during the year ended december   consisting of severance related to the termination of employees to eliminate certain duplicative activities 
in addition to management of our operating expenses  we must continue to conserve our cash 
our combined total of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities was million as of december   compared to million at december  our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
we had approximately million in short term and long term debt as of december  we paid million of our outstanding debt  plus accrued interest  in february we may in the future need to raise additional cash through borrowing or sale of equity securities or to renegotiate the payment terms of our debt 

table of contents we incurred a net loss of million for year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  prior to considering the impact of the adoption of statement of accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  we believed that the efficiencies achieved by our merger with horizon and continued growth in sales of our products would permit us to achieve profitability for the year ended december  we have not yet been able to determine the impact of sfas no 
r on our future results  but we expect to incur significant charges as a result of adoption of the standard 
profitability further depends on  among other things  our success in expanding product usage in our current markets and in developing new markets  as well as the successful integration of horizon s operations 
to the extent current or new markets do not materialize in accordance with our expectations  our sales could be lower than expected and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we believe the following accounting policies have been critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
we believe users of our financial statements  including potential and current investors  will find an explanation of these policies important to understanding our discussions of financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
a more extensive review of all accounting policies considered to be significant in the preparation of our financial statements appears in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
trade accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we extend credit to our customers  who are primarily private companies in the united states  europe and asia 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and past transaction credit worthiness and generally require no collateral 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on our assessment of the likelihood of collection of individual accounts 
this allowance may prove to be inadequate if collections fail to meet current estimates  which could occur as a result of general economic conditions or the insolvency of specific key customers 
inventories and inventory reserves inventories are stated at the lower of cost using standard costs  which approximate actual costs on a first in  first out basis or market 
we maintain a reserve for obsolete  unmarketable or excess product based on assumptions regarding future demand  historical experience and market conditions 
we may be required to make further provisions to our reserve if market conditions prove less favorable than our current expectations  or if the introduction of new products renders existing products obsolete 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon receipt of a customer purchase order and subsequent product shipment provided no significant obligations remain and collection of the associated receivable is deemed reasonably assured 
except for our two distributors in the united states  our customers have no price protection and may only return undamaged product within thirty days of purchase 
our two distributors in the united states have no price protection  but it is our policy for these two customers to swap new product for undamaged returned product within days of purchase  subject to a limit of of their purchases in our preceding fiscal quarter 
based on our historical rate of product returns  we maintain a reserve for projected future product returns  provisions to this reserve are accounted for as a deduction from current period sales 
should changes in conditions  including the rate of product returns  or the status of obligations cause us to determine that our criteria for revenue recognition are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
payments for maintenance services are usually prepaid and the related maintenance revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the service contract term 
service contract terms range from to months 
through december   all of our billings have been denominated in us dollars  although we expect relatively minor billings in foreign currencies in future periods 

table of contents deferred tax valuation allowance deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
we have established a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to zero 
while we have considered potential future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the full valuation allowance  in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
subsequently  we would recognize tax expense at amounts approximating statutory rates 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for our goodwill under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the sfas no 
goodwill impairment model is a two step process 
first  it requires a comparison of the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units that have goodwill assigned to them 
in our case  operating in one business segment  the fair value of the reporting unit is equal to our market capitalization 
if fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
recoverability of the asset is measure by comparison of the asset s carrying amount to future net undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
if such asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the projected discounted future net cash flows arising from the asset 
we test goodwill for impairment during the third quarter of every fiscal year  and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment exists 
events that could  in the future  result in impairment include  but are not limited to  sharply declining sales for a significant product or in a significant geographic region 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets whenever events or changes in business conditions indicate that these carrying values may not be recoverable in the ordinary course of business 
when such an event occurs  our management determines whether there has been impairment by comparing the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows to the related asset s carrying value 
if an asset is considered impaired  the asset is written down to fair value  which is determined based either on discounted cash flows or appraised value  depending on the nature of the asset 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of sales represented by certain items in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and years ended december  sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring total operating expenses loss from operations interest expense interest and other income  net net loss 
table of contents the following table sets forth comparisons of key components of our sales results for the years ended december  and  providing additional information on the sales impact of the consolidation of our acquired specialty access catheter products 
growth domestic sales radiofrequency ablation products specialty access catheter products total domestic sales international sales radiofrequency ablation products specialty access catheter products total international sales total radiofrequency ablation sales total specialty access catheter products total sales years ended december  and for the year ended december   sales totaled million  an increase of or million from million in the merger with horizon added million to our sales  while sales of our radiofrequency ablation products grew million or over domestic sales of radiofrequency ablation products were higher in than in we believe that sales were limited by the impact of training and turnover in our sales group that resulted from the horizon merger 
international sales of radiofrequency ablation products grew over for the year ended december   domestic sales represented of total sales  compared to in radiofrequency ablation products accounted for of sales in  while specialty access catheter products accounted for of sales  although the results of the specialty access catheter products acquired in the horizon merger reflect only sales made from july  through december  cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was million as compared to million in  resulting in a gross margin for compared to a gross margin rate in as with our sales results  the increase in our cost of goods sold was primarily due to the merger with horizon and inclusion of the results of the acquired specialty access catheter products 
our cost of goods sold during the fourth quarter of reflected a negative impact of approximately million in inefficiencies resulting from the transfer of our radiofrequency product manufacturing operations from our mountain view  california location to our manchester  georgia location 
these inefficiencies will likely continue into the second quarter of  because we do not expect to achieve full production volumes or complete training of our manufacturing personnel in georgia until that point 
our cost of goods sold in was also affected by amortization of intangibles  including million in amortization of capitalized license fees associated with the settlement of our patent litigation dispute with boston scientific corporation and million in amortization of a product technology intangible asset recognized as part of the horizon merger 
the amortization expense of the product technology intangible asset will grow to million in  as we will amortize the asset for a full year  rather than only five months 
we expect such amortization charges to continue through research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million in this decrease was due to reduced new product development and clinical trial costs 
we expect an increase in research expenditures for  driven by developmental charges associated with technical innovation of our products  the expansion of our product line after the horizon merger and  to some extent  the implementation of sfas r 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million in most of the increase  about million  reflects higher sales  marketing and administrative expenses associated with our increased size after the horizon merger  including million in amortization of related intangibles 
however  about million of the increase was due to expenses associated with merger integration and sales training  and another million of the increase was due to legal  audit and consulting expenses associated with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of our bad debt expense was about million lower in than in  primarily reflecting reduced allowances relating to our domestic distributors 
in  we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase to as a result of including a full year of the operations acquired from horizon  compared to only five months in also  a further increase will result from implementation of sfas r 
we are not now able to precisely quantify the impact of sfas r on our results  but we believe it will significantly increase our selling  general and administrative expenses 
we incurred restructuring expenses of million during the year ended december   consisting of severance related to the termination of employees to eliminate certain duplicative activities  primarily in the areas of sales  accounting and operations 
we do not expect significant additional restructuring expenses in interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to zero during the year ended december  the interest expense in relates to debt assumed in the merger with horizon  the balance of which was million at december  we had no debt throughout in  despite payments made or to be made on our debt  interest expense on the remaining debt will be incurred for twelve months rather than only five months  as in for this reason  and because the interest rate on some of our remaining debt is scheduled to increase in  we expect our interest expense to increase to approximately million in interest income was essentially zero during the year ended december   down from million for the year ended december   because average daily cash balances fell during as we utilized cash for operations 
years ended december  and for the year ended december   sales totaled million  a decrease of from million in this result was due to a reduction of million  or  in year to year sales to our distributor in japan  where the reduction of in country inventory levels severely limited demand in elsewhere  our business grew 
domestic sales were higher in than in  as we increased our installed customer base 
international sales  excluding japan  grew by in  compared with  reflecting higher sales in the rest of asia and some european markets 
for the year ended december   domestic sales represented of total sales  compared to in sales of our disposable products grew by compared with results  although hardware sales  influenced by the decrease in shipments to japan  decreased 
for the year ended december   disposable sales accounted for of total revenue  compared to in cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was million as compared to million in  resulting in a gross margin for compared to a gross margin rate in cost of goods sold was affected by charges for obsolete inventory that totaled approximately million for  down from million in costs for the first two quarters of were further increased by temporary price increases of approximately million on our vendor sourced ancillary infusion pumps 
these temporary charges ceased by june of our cost of goods sold in also included million amortization of capitalized license fees associated with the settlement of our patent litigation dispute with boston scientific corporation 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million in this decrease was due to reduced new product development and clinical trial costs 
also  there were no charges for amortization of deferred stock based compensation in  compared to million of such charges for 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million in about million of this decrease is due to lower selling expenses  on lower headcount  reflecting organizational changes in our domestic sales group 
another million in reduced expense resulted from lower provisions to our allowance for uncollectible accounts  as our collection experience with our international customers stabilized 
also  there were no charges for amortization of deferred stock based compensation in  compared to million of such charges for other marketing and general administrative expense areas increased by million in over interest income was million for the year ended december   down from million in  because average daily cash balances fell during as we utilized cash for operations 
we had no interest expense for  compared with  for liquidity and capital resources prior to august  we financed our operations principally through private placements of convertible preferred stock  raising approximately million net of expenses 
on august   we completed our initial public offering of million common shares at a price of per share  raising approximately million net of expenses 
all outstanding convertible preferred shares were converted to common shares at that time 
to a lesser extent  we also financed our operations through equipment financing and other loans that were fully repaid as of december  in january of  we raised an additional million  net of expenses  through a private placement of our common shares 
in november of  we raised an additional million  net of expenses  through a second private placement of our common shares 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  million of marketable securities and million of working capital 
for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was million principally due to our net loss of million  offset by non cash charges of million  including depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation and provisions to reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable and inventory 
stock based compensation for totaled  primarily from issuance of options to non employees 
approximately million in cash was provided in by changes in working capital accounts  including million in reduced inventory  million in reduced prepaid and other current assets  a million in reduced accounts receivable and million in higher accounts payable and current accrued liabilities 
during  million was provided by investing activities  with net sales of marketable securities providing million offset by million used in purchase of property and equipment 
further  the acquisition of horizon used million in cash  the excess of professional service expenses incurred in the merger over horizon s cash as of the merger date 
financing activities for the year provided million in cash  including the million we raised in our november private placement of common stock and million related to the issuance of common stock in conjunction with the exercise of stock options 
we used million to make payments on our debt 

table of contents we have  from time to time  financed equipment through capital and operating leases 
also  in the course of the horizon merger  we acquired debt  the balance of which was million as of december  as of december   we had no future minimum payments due under capital leases 
future minimum payments due under operating leases  including the operating lease we have entered regarding our new headquarters space in fremont  california  and debt agreements were as follows in thousands operating leases debt total year ending december  year ending december  year ending december  year ending december  year ending december  year ending december  and thereafter total of future minimum operating lease payments our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including our research and development expenditures  expenses related to selling  general and administrative operations and working capital to support business growth 
our net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  in  we will be required to make million in debt payments  million of this amount was made in february our balance of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on december  was million 
although it is difficult for us to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty  we believe that our current balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next months 
during or after this period  if cash generated by operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities  obtain an additional credit facility or renegotiate debt repayment terms 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us or  if available  that such financing will be available on terms favorable to us and our stockholders  or that we will be successful in renegotiating debt repayment terms 
failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed  to make timely debt payments  or to achieve our growth or profitability objectives may require us to curtail operations  perhaps to a significant extent 
private placement of securities on november   we entered into stock and warrant purchase agreements  with sf capital partners ltd  baystar capital  walker smith capital and its affiliates and capital ventures international 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreements  we sold an aggregate of  shares of its unregistered common stock at a per share price of and warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of its common stock which are initially exercisable at a price of per share  netting approximately million after issuance fees and expenses 
the issuance was deemed to be exempt from registration under the securities act in reliance upon section thereof as transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering

table of contents income taxes as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  available to offset future regular taxable income 
we have fully reserved our deferred tax assets  however  because realization of favorable tax assets in future returns is very uncertain 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire between and  and the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire between and  if not utilized 
the tax reform act of limits the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of the company  and our utilization of our carryforwards could be restricted

 chapter sfas no 
clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning in the second quarter of fiscal we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  which replaces sfas no 
sfas no 
r requires public companies to recognize an expense for share based payment arrangements including stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
the statement eliminates a company s ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb  and generally requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
sfas no 
r requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant  and to recognize the cost over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
sfas no 
r is effective for us in the quarter ending september  upon adoption of sfas r  companies are allowed to select one of three alternative transition methods  each of which has different financial reporting implications 
management is currently evaluating the transition methods  valuation methodologies and other assumptions for employee stock options in light of sfas no 
r 
current estimates of option values using the black scholes method may not be indicative of results from the valuation methodologies we ultimately implement upon adoption of sfas no 
r 
although we have not yet fully quantified the impact this standard will have on our financial statements  it is likely that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
factors that may affect future results in addition to the other information in this report  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business and prospects we may be unable to integrate our operations successfully and realize all of the anticipated benefits of our merger with horizon medical products 
our merger with horizon involves the integration of two companies that previously have operated independently  which is a complex  costly and time consuming process 
the difficulties of combining the companies operations include  among other things coordinating geographically disparate organizations  systems and facilities  
table of contents integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds  consolidating corporate and administrative functions  consolidating research and development  and manufacturing operations  coordinating sales and marketing functions  retaining key employees  and preserving research and development  collaboration  distribution  marketing  promotion and other important relationships of the companies 
the process of integrating our operations with horizon s has caused and could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of the combined company s business and the loss of key personnel 
the diversion of our management s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the integration of our operations with those of horizon medical products could harm our business  results of operations  financial condition or prospects after the merger 
we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
failure to remediate these weaknesses could impact the reliability of our financial reporting 
to date  we have identified material weaknesses in our procurement process which did  prior to adjustment  or could otherwise  result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements 
as a result of these material weaknesses  we have determined that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december  see our disclosure in status of management s report on internal control over financial reporting included under item a for further discussion of these material weaknesses 
because of the significant delays we have encountered in executing against our internal section project plan  it is possible that we will not be able to timely deliver the required management report on internal control over financial reporting may  if we are not so able to report by this extended due date  we will no longer be current in our exchange act reporting obligations and the liquidity of our common stock for certain of our selling stockholders will be adversely impacted 
in an exemptive order dated november   the securities and exchange commission provided an extension on the due date for management s and the independent registered accounting firm s reports on internal control over financial reporting for certain filers until may  we are eligible for this extended due date and will elect to use it 
however  because of the significant delays we have encountered in executing against our internal section project plan  it is possible that we will not be able to timely deliver the required management report by the extended due date 
if we are not able to deliver this report by may   we will no longer be current in our exchange act reporting obligations 
as a result  selling stockholders would be unable to use any registration statements on form s and on form s that we had filed in order for them to sell their shares of our common stock 
furthermore  selling stockholders would be unable to rely upon rule of the securities act in order to sell their shares of our common stock 
the liquidity of our common stock for these selling stockholders will be reduced 

table of contents we will be heavily dependent on the rita system and our line of specialty access catheters in order to achieve our sales goals and our profitability targets 
failure to achieve and grow market acceptance for either product line could harm our business 
the majority of our sales will come from the sale of the rita system and our line of specialty access catheters 
our financial performance will depend upon physician adoption and patient awareness of these products 
if we are unable to convince physicians to use these products  we may not be able to generate sales because we do not have alternative products 
we have a history of losses and may never achieve profitability 
we incurred net losses of million in  million in  million in  million in  million in and million in at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
to become profitable we must increase our sales and continue to limit the growth of our operating expenses 
if our sales do not grow  or if expenses grow excessively  we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
because we face significant competition from companies with greater resources than we have  we may be unable to compete effectively 
the market for our products is intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
in the market for radiofrequency ablation products  we compete directly with two companies both domestically and internationally radiotherapeutics corporation  a division of boston scientific  and radionics  inc  a division of tyco healthcare  which is a division of tyco international 
boston scientific and tyco international are publicly traded companies with substantially greater resources than we have 
both radiotherapeutics and radionics sell products that use radiofrequency energy to ablate soft tissue 
furthermore  in april  we entered into a license agreement with boston scientific  its affiliates and licensors  pursuant to which we granted boston scientific rights to manufacture and sell products using our infusion technology after october  as a result  boston scientific may develop and sell some competing products that would  in the absence of this license agreement  infringe our patents 
in the market for specialty access catheters and ports  we compete directly with cr bard inc cr bard is a publicly traded company with substantially greater resources than we have 
we are also aware of several companies in international markets that sell products that compete directly with ours 
these companies are affecting our international market share and may erode that share in the future 
in addition  one of these companies  berchtold corporation  has received fda clearance for using radiofrequency energy to ablate soft tissue 
alternative therapies could prove to be superior to the rita radiofrequency ablation system or implantable vascular products  and physician adoption of our products could be negatively affected 
in addition to competing against other companies offering products that use radiofrequency energy to ablate soft tissue or implantable vascular products  we also compete against companies developing  manufacturing and marketing alternative therapies that address solid cancerous and benign tumors 
if these alternative therapies prove to offer treatment options that are perceived to be superior to our system or to have less severe side effects than those resulting from our system  physician adoption of our products could be negatively affected and our sales could decline 

table of contents we currently lack long term data regarding the safety and efficacy of our radiofrequency ablation products and may find that long term data does not support our short term clinical results or that further short or long term studies do not support the safety and efficacy of our radiofrequency ablation products in various applications 
if the safety or efficacy of our radiofrequency ablation products is questioned  our sales could decline 
our radiofrequency ablation products are supported by clinical follow up data in published clinical reports or scientific presentations covering periods from five months to five years after radiofrequency ablation 
if additional studies in liver cancer or in other applications fail to confirm or demonstrate the effectiveness of our radiofrequency ablation products  our sales could decline 
if longer term patient follow up or clinical studies indicate that our procedures cause unexpected  serious complications or other unforeseen negative effects  we could be subject to significant liability 
further  because some of our data has been produced in studies that were retrospective  not randomized  or included small patient populations and because  in certain circumstances  we rely on clinical data developed by independent third party physicians  our clinical data may not be reproduced in wider patient populations 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights or if we are found to infringe the rights of others  we may lose market share to our competitors and our business could suffer 
our success depends significantly on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our products  and yet we may be unable to do so 
a number of companies in our market  as well as universities and research institutions  have issued patents and have filed patent applications that relate to the use of radiofrequency energy to ablate soft tissue or to the design or manufacture of implantable vascular products 
under certain circumstances these could result in lawsuits against us 
our pending united states and foreign patent applications may not issue or may issue and be subsequently successfully challenged by others 
in addition  our pending patent applications include claims to material aspects of our products that are not currently protected by issued patents 
both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive 
in the event a competitor infringes on our patent or other intellectual property rights  enforcing those rights may be difficult and time consuming 
even if successful  litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against challenge could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention 
we may not have sufficient resources to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against a challenge 
in addition  confidentiality agreements executed by our employees  consultants and advisors may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  we could lose market share to our competitors and our business could suffer 
our dependence on international revenues  which account for a significant portion of our total revenues  could harm our business 
because our future profitability will depend in part on our ability to increase product sales in international markets  we are exposed to risks specific to business operations outside the united states 
these risks include the challenge of managing international sales without direct access to the end customer  lower average selling prices for our products  due to distributor discounts  the risk of inventory build up by our distributors which could negatively impact sales in future periods  obtaining reimbursement for procedures using our devices in some foreign markets  the burden of complying with complex and changing foreign regulatory requirements  longer accounts receivable collection time  
table of contents significant currency fluctuations  which could cause our distributors to reduce the number of products they purchase from us because the cost of our products to them could increase relative to the price they could charge their customers  reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries  and contractual provisions governed by foreign laws 
we are substantially dependent on two distributors in our international markets  and if we lose either distributor or if either distributor significantly reduces its product demand  our international and total sales could decline 
we are substantially dependent on a limited number of significant distributors in our international markets  and if we lose these distributors and fail to attract additional distributors  our international sales could decline 
itx corporation  formerly known as nissho iwai corporation  is our primary distributor in asia 
although it accounted for only of our international sales in  it accounted for of our international sales in mdh mdh forniture ospedaliere  our distributor in italy  accounted for of our international in and of our international sales in international sales accounted for of our total sales in  and these two distributors represented of that total 
for the year ended december   international sales accounted for of our total sales and these distributors represented of that total 
the loss of either distributor or a significant decrease in unit purchases by either distributor could cause our sales to decline substantially 
if we are unable to attract additional international distributors  our international and total sales may not grow 
our relationships with third party distributors could negatively affect our sales 
we sell our products in international markets and selected domestic markets through third party distributors over whom we have limited control  and  if they fail to adequately support our products  our sales could decline 
in the past  we have terminated agreements with distributors and although we contracted with replacement distributors  we expended significant time and resources in doing so  and our sales in the affected markets suffered during the transition period that lasted approximately nine months 
if our distributors or we terminate other distributor agreements  we could incur similar or more burdensome expenses  we could expend significant time and resources in finding replacement distributors  and our sales could decrease during any related transition period 
we are aware that some of our distributors have built up inventory of our products 
as a result  future sales to these distributors could be negatively impacted 
sales to our japanese distributor in and and to a domestic distributor in the three months ended september  were so affected 
in addition  while our distributors have no price protection and may only return undamaged products per our return policies  if we permit the return of products in excess of our provision for returns  we will have to adjust our revenues relating to these products 
this may also impact our revenue recognition policy on future distributor sales 
in  we significantly increased our allowance for doubtful accounts to address the risk associated with longer collection periods that have arisen principally with our european distributors 
although the deterioration we experienced in international collections in stabilized in  and remained stable in  we may encounter new difficulties with collections that require further increases in our allowance for doubtful accounts in the future  and we may require specific accounts to post letters of credit or pay in advance to minimize our credit risk 
further  we may  in the future  terminate relationships with some of the domestic distributors utilized by horizon prior to the merger  making collection of accounts receivable with these customers difficult 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts sufficiently reflects this possibility  but additional provisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are could be required 
additional future increases in our allowance for doubtful accounts would reduce our profits 

table of contents if customers in markets outside the united states experience difficulty obtaining reimbursement for procedures using our products  international sales could decline 
certain of the markets outside the united states in which we sell our products require that specific reimbursement codes be obtained before reimbursement for procedures using our products can be approved 
as a result  in countries where specific reimbursement codes are strictly required and have not yet been issued  reimbursement has been denied on that basis 
if our distributors or we are unable to either obtain the required reimbursement codes or develop an effective strategy to resolve the reimbursement issue  physicians in foreign markets may be unwilling to purchase our products  negatively impacting our international revenues 
our business is dependent upon reimbursement from government programs  such as medicare and medicaid  and we may face limitations on such third party reimbursement  which could harm our operating results 
in the united states  our products are purchased primarily by hospitals and medical clinics  which then bill various third party payors  such as medicare  medicaid and other government programs and private insurance plans  for the healthcare services provided to patients 
government agencies  private insurers and other payors determine whether to provide coverage for a particular procedure and reimburse hospitals for medical treatment at a fixed rate based on the diagnosis related group  or drg  established by the united states centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms 
the fixed rate of reimbursement is based on the procedure performed and is unrelated to the specific devices used in that procedure 
if a procedure is not covered by a drg  payors may deny reimbursement 
in addition  third party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that the device used in a treatment was unnecessary  inappropriate or not cost effective  experimental or used for a non approved indication 
there can be no assurance that reimbursement for implantation of our vascular access ports and catheter products will continue at current levels  or that future reimbursement policies of third party payors will not adversely affect our ability to sell our vascular products on a profitable basis 
failure by hospitals and other users of our products to obtain reimbursement from third party payors  or changes in government and private third party payors policies toward reimbursement for procedures employing our products  would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on key employees in a competitive market for skilled personnel and without additional employees we cannot grow or achieve profitability 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management team  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  as well as key staff in the areas of finance  operations and research and development 
our future success will depend in part on the continued service of our staff and our ability to identify  hire and retain additional personnel 
the markets for qualified management personnel in northern california  where our headquarters are located  and georgia  where are primary operating facilities are located  are competitive and expected to remain so 
because the environment for good personnel is so competitive  costs related to compensation may increase significantly 
if we are unable to attract and retain both the management team and key personnel we need to support and grow our business  our business will suffer 
we are subject to  and may in the future be subject to  costly and time consuming product liability actions 
we manufacture medical devices that are used on patients in both minimally invasive and open surgical procedures and  as a result  we are and may in the future be subject to product liability lawsuits 
any product liability claim brought against us  with or without merit  could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates or the inability to secure coverage in the future 
in addition  we could have to pay any amount awarded by a court in excess of policy limits 
finally  even a meritless or unsuccessful product liability claim could be time consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of management s attention from managing our core business 

table of contents any failure in our physician training efforts could result in lower than expected product sales 
it is critical to our sales effort to train a sufficient number of physicians and to instruct them properly in the procedures that utilize our products 
we have established formal physician training programs and rely on physicians to devote adequate time to understanding how and when our products should be used 
if physicians are not properly trained  they may misuse or ineffectively use our products 
such use may result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes  patient injury and related liability or negative publicity that could have an adverse effect on our product sales 
we may incur significant costs related to a class action lawsuit due to the likely volatility of our stock 
our stock price is likely to fluctuate owing to market uncertainty about our ability to successfully integrate the operations of horizon and manage our cash during the process of integration 
our stock price may also fluctuate for a number of other reasons including our ability to repay debt  our ability to successfully commercialize our products  our ability to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of conclusions that our internal control over financial reporting are ineffective  announcements regarding patent litigation or the issuance of patents to us or our competitors  quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations  announcements of technological or competitive developments by us or our competitors  product liability claims  regulatory developments regarding us or our competitors  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors  changes in estimates of our financial performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts  and general market conditions  particularly for companies with small market capitalizations 
securities class action litigation is often brought against a company after a period of volatility in the market price of its stock 
if our future quarterly operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the price of our common stock would likely decline 
stock price fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our common stock is low 
any securities litigation claims brought against us could result in substantial expense and divert management s attention from our core business 
we have limited experience manufacturing our disposable devices in substantial quantities  and if we are unable to hire sufficient additional personnel or to purchase additional equipment or are otherwise unable to meet customer demand  our business could suffer 
also  we are consolidating our manufacturing operations at our manchester  georgia location  and  prior to september   personnel at that location had essentially no experience in manufacturing our radiofrequency ablation disposable devices 
to be successful  we must manufacture our products in substantial quantities in compliance with regulatory requirements at acceptable costs 
if we do not succeed in manufacturing quantities of our disposable devices that meet customer demand  we could lose customers and our business could suffer 
at the present time  we have limited high volume manufacturing experience 
our manufacturing operations are currently focused on the in house assembly of our disposable devices 
as we increase our manufacturing volume and the number of product designs for our disposable devices  the complexity of our manufacturing processes will increase 
because our manufacturing operations are primarily dependent upon manual assembly  if demand for our system increases we 
table of contents will need to hire additional personnel and may need to purchase additional equipment 
if we are unable to sufficiently staff and equip our manufacturing operations  particularly considering our plans to consolidate our manufacturing operations in our manchester  georgia location by the second quarter of  or are otherwise unable to meet customer demand for our products  our business could suffer 
we will relocate our headquarters to a new facility in we will incur moving expenses  and if we become unable to meet customer demand through disruption of manufacturing operations  our business could suffer 
we are planning to relocate our headquarters facility in april  and to complete transition of our manufacturing operations to our manchester  georgia location by that time 
in so doing  we will incur normal and customary moving costs and may experience an interruption in our manufacturing operations 
if we become unable to meet customer demand for our products  our business could suffer 
we are dependent on two suppliers as the only sources of a component that we use in our radiofrequency ablation disposable devices  and any disruption in the supply of this component could negatively affect our business 
until  there was only one supplier available to provide us with a component that we include in our disposable devices 
during the quarter ended september   we qualified a second supplier 
however  a disruption in the supply of this component is still possible and could negatively affect revenues 
if we were unable to remedy a disruption in supply of this component within twelve months  we could be required to redesign the handle of our disposable devices  which could divert engineering resources from other projects or add to product costs 
in addition  a new or supplemental filing with applicable regulatory authorities may require clearance prior to our marketing a product containing new materials 
this clearance process may take a substantial period of time  and we may be unable to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for any new material to be used in our products on a timely basis  if at all 
we are dependent on one supplier as our only source of an accessory device used in conjunction with our starburst xli and xlie lines of disposable devices  and any disruption in the supply of this device could negatively affect our sales 
in the past  we have experienced shortages in the supply of accessory infusion pumps used in conjunction with our starburst xli and starburst xlie lines of disposable radiofrequency devices 
we currently have one supplier for our accessory infusion pumps and  although we believe this supplier to be reliable  future disruptions in supply are possible 
in that event  our business could suffer through lower sales or higher costs 
we are dependent on two third party contractors for the supply of our generators  and any failure to deliver generators to us could result in lower than expected sales 
we are dependent on two third party suppliers to produce our generators 
while we have agreements with both of these suppliers  any delay in shipments of generators to us could result in our failure to ship generators to customers and could negatively affect sales 
complying with the fda and other domestic and foreign regulatory authorities is an expensive and time consuming process  and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties 
we are subject to a host of federal  state  local and foreign regulations regarding the manufacture and marketing of our products 
in particular  our failure to comply with fda regulations could result in  among other things  seizures or recalls of our products  an injunction  substantial fines and or criminal charges against our employees and us 
the fda s medical device reporting regulations require us to report any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury  or in which our products malfunctioned in a way that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction recurred 

table of contents sales of our products outside the united states are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary from country to country 
the time required to obtain approvals from foreign countries may be longer than that required for fda approval or clearance  and requirements for foreign licensing may differ from fda requirements 
for example  some of our newer rfa products have not received approval in japan 
any failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for our new products in foreign countries could negatively affect revenues 
product introductions or modifications may be delayed or canceled as a result of the fda regulatory process  which could cause our revenues to be below expectations 
unless we are exempt  we must obtain the appropriate fda approval or clearance before we can sell a new medical device in the united states 
obtaining this approval or clearance can be a lengthy and time consuming process 
to date  all of our products have received clearances from the fda through premarket notification under section k of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
however  if the fda requires us to submit a new premarket notification under section k for modifications to our existing products  or if the fda requires us to go through a lengthier  more rigorous examination than we now expect  our product introductions or modifications could be delayed or canceled which could cause our revenues to be below expectations 
the fda may determine that future products will require the more costly  lengthy and uncertain premarket approval process 
in addition  modifications to medical device products cleared via the k process may require a new k submission 
we have  in the past  made minor modifications to the rita system and to our implantable vascular products 
using the guidelines established by the fda  we have determined that some of these modifications do not require us to file new k submissions 
if the fda disagrees with our determinations  we may not be able to sell the rita system or our implantable vascular products until the fda has cleared new k submissions for these modifications  or it may require us to recall previously sold products 
in addition  we intend to request additional label indications  such as approvals or clearances for the ablation of tumors in additional organs  including lung  uterus and breast  for our current products 
the fda may either deny these requests outright  require additional extensive clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared product as a condition of approval or clearance 
therefore  obtaining necessary approvals or clearances for these additional applications could be an expensive and lengthy process 
in addition  in the course of the fda process leading to clearance or approval for a new indication  the fda may request an advisory panel meeting or meetings to discuss the clinical data  the appropriate study design or other criteria for clearance or approval 
in the event that the advisory panel advises fda that the clinical data are inadequate or the study design or other criteria are inappropriate  and the fda concurs  the fda clearance or approval process could be lengthened and anticipated revenues from that new indication would be delayed 
we may acquire technologies or companies in the future  which could result in the dilution of our stockholders and disruption of our business  and reduce our revenues 
we are continually evaluating business alliances and external investments in technologies related to our business 
acquisitions of companies  divisions of companies  businesses or products entail numerous risks  any of which could materially harm our business in several ways  including diversion of management s attention from our core business objectives and other business concerns  failure to integrate efficiently businesses or technologies acquired in the future with our pre existing business or technologies  potential loss of key employees from either our pre existing business or the acquired business  dilution of our existing stockholders as a result of issuing equity securities  and assumption of liabilities of the acquired company 
some or all of these problems may result from future acquisitions or investments 
furthermore  we may not realize any value from such acquisitions or investments 

table of contents we may need to raise additional capital in the future resulting in dilution to our stockholders 
we may need to raise additional funds for our business operations and to execute our business strategy 
we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or to obtain an additional credit facility 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights that are senior to holders of common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
any additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed or to make timely debt payments may require us to curtail operations  perhaps to a significant extent 
our executive officers and directors could exert significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval 
our executive officers and directors  and their respective affiliates  own approximately of our outstanding common stock as of january  these stockholders may  as a practical matter  be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combinations 
this concentration of voting stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition or other change of control that a stockholder may consider favorable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to interest rate risk at december  and december  is related to our investment portfolio 
we had no interest rate sensitive borrowings as of december  or december   although as of december   we have borrowings with interest rates that will increase by fixed amounts as of certain dates during fixed rate investments and borrowings may have their fair market value adversely impacted from changes in interest rates 
floating rate investments may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall  and floating rate borrowings  should we acquire any  will lead to additional interest expense if interest rates increase 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations  and our interest expense may be above our expectations 
further  we may suffer losses in investment principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the united states government and its agencies and in high quality corporate issuers 
the average contractual duration of our investments in was less than one year 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that there is no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
our outstanding long term debt is fixed rate and not subject to rate fluctuation  although our senior notes feature scheduled rate increases in january and july of the fair value of our debt will increase or decrease as interest rates decrease or increase  respectively 
all of our sales and purchases have historically been denominated in united states dollars 
in the future  we may begin to make sales in other currencies such as the euro 
we currently have no significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk and such risk in the future is expected to be minimal
