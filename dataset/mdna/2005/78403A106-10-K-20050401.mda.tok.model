overview historical background 
we originally incorporated as caldera systems  inc  a utah corporation as previously defined  caldera systems  on august   and reincorporated as a delaware corporation on march  in march  we completed an initial public offering of our common stock 
on may   we formed a new holding company in delaware under the name of caldera international  inc as previously defined  caldera international to acquire substantially all of the assets and operations of the server and professional services groups of the santa cruz operation now known as tarantella  inc 
in connection with this acquisition  caldera systems became a wholly owned subsidiary of caldera international 
former holders of shares and options to purchase shares of caldera systems received an equal number of shares and options to purchase shares in caldera international 
on may   our stockholders approved our corporate name change to the sco group  inc recent developments 
as described in the section entitled recent sales of unregistered securities above in part ii  item of this form k  we issued shares and granted options under our equity compensation plans without complying with registration or qualification requirements under federal securities laws and the securities laws of certain states 
as a result  certain plan participants have a right to rescind their purchases of shares under the equity compensation plans or recover damages if they no longer own the shares or hold unexercised options  subject to applicable statutes of limitations 
although we are evaluating the possible actions we may take in response to these securities law compliance issues  we may make a rescission offer to certain plan participants entitled to rescission rights subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals 
if our potential rescission offer is made and accepted by all plan participants holding certain espp shares and all shares acquired from the exercise of stock options  or such participants otherwise make rescission claims against us  we could be required to make aggregate payments to these plan participants of up to  this amount is based on espp shares and shares issued upon the exercise of stock options that have been retained by plan participants as of october  and excludes interest and other charges we may be required to pay 
we may face additional rescission liability to plan participants holding unexercised stock options in california  georgia and possibly other states  and regulatory authorities also may require us to pay fines or impose other sanctions on us 
on february   we received a notice from the staff of the nasdaq stock market indicating that we are subject to potential delisting from the nasdaq smallcap market for failure to comply with nasdaq s requirement to file this form k for the fiscal year ended october  in a timely fashion 
receipt of the notice did not result in immediate delisting of our common stock 
nasdaq stated that  unless we requested a hearing on nasdaq s delisting notice  our securities would be delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market at the opening of business on february  we requested a hearing with the nasdaq listing qualifications panel on this matter  which stayed the delisting pending the hearing and a determination by the nasdaq listing qualifications panel 
the hearing occurred on march  at the hearing  we outlined for the panel our plan for filing this form k and our quarterly report on form q for the first quarter of the current fiscal year the form q  which also was not filed in a timely fashion 
on march   we received another notice from the staff of the nasdaq stock market regarding our potential delisting as a result of our failure to file the form q in a timely fashion 
the notice informed us that the panel will consider the filing delinquency of our form q in addition to the filing delinquency of this form k in rendering its decision regarding our listing status 
we will continue to be listed on the nasdaq smallcap market under the symbol scoxe pending the issuance of the panel s decision 
on october   we entered into an engagement agreement the engagement agreement with boies  schiller flexner llp  kevin mcbride and berger singerman the law firms 
the engagement agreement supercedes and replaces the original engagement agreement that was entered into in february the engagement agreement governs the relationship between us and the law firms in connection with their representation of us in our current litigation between us and ibm  novell  red hat  autozone and daimlerchrysler the sco litigation  through the end of the current litigation between us and ibm 
this litigation is described in more detail under part i  item of this form k 
our purpose in entering into this engagement agreement was to limit the cash expenditures needed to pursue the sco litigation 
the engagement agreement provides for the payment of approximately  for certain previously accrued expenses totaling  at october  and all future attorney fees in connection with the sco litigation through the end of the current litigation between us and ibm and the escrow of at least  for the payment of any expert  consulting and other expenses 
as of october   this  was classified as a component of restricted cash 
we paid the  subsequent to october  future legal fees covered under the engagement agreement will require us to pay to the law firms  per quarter for each successive quarter beginning september  and ending december  for a total amount of  of which  will be paid in fiscal year in the first quarter of fiscal year  we made the quarterly payments for september as well as december for a total of  the payment of these fees has had and will continue to have a material impact on our cash position 
in addition to the cash expenditures mentioned above  we must also pay one or more contingency fees upon any amount we or our stockholders may receive as a recovery from our litigation  our intellectual property licensing or a sale of our company 
the contingency fee amounts payable to the law firms will be  subject to certain credits and adjustments  as follows percent of any aggregate recovery amounts received up to  plus percent of any aggregate recovery amounts above  but less than or equal to  plus percent of any aggregate recovery amounts in excess of  the engagement agreement specifically provides that  except for the compensation obligations specifically described above  we will not be obligated to pay any legal fees  whether hourly  contingent or otherwise  to the law firms  or any other law firms that may be engaged by the law firms  in connection with the sco litigation through the end of the current litigation between us and ibm  including any appeals 
business focus we generate revenue from sales of product and services from our unix business and from sales of scosource ip licenses and vendor licenses from our scosource business 
unix business 
our unix business serves the needs of small to medium sized businesses  including replicated site franchisees of fortune companies  by providing reliable  cost effective unix operating systems and software products to power computers running on intel architecture 
our largest source of unix business revenue is derived from existing customers through our worldwide  indirect  leveraged channel of partners which includes distributors and independent solution providers 
we have a presence in a number of countries that provide support and services to customers and resellers 
the other principal channel for selling and marketing our unix products is through existing customers that have a large number of replicated sites or franchisees 
we access these corporations through their information technology or purchasing departments with our asms in the united states and through our reseller channel in countries outside the united states 
in addition  we also sell our operating system products to oems 
our sales of unix products and services during the last several fiscal years have been primarily to pre existing unix customers and not newly acquired customers 
our unix business revenue depends significantly on our ability to market and sell our products to existing customers and to generate upgrades from existing customers 
the following table shows the operating results of the unix business for fiscal years  and in thousands revenue cost of revenue gross margin sales and marketing research and development general and administrative other total operating expenses loss from operations other costs include amortization of intangibles  stock based compensation  loss on disposition and write offs of long lived assets  loss on investments and severance and exit costs 
revenue from our unix business decreased by  or percent  for fiscal year compared to fiscal year and decreased by  or percent  for fiscal year compared to fiscal year the revenue from this business has been declining over the last several fiscal years primarily as a result of increased competition from alternative operating systems  particularly linux 
if revenue from our unix business continues to decline and we are unable to generate positive cash flow  our unix business will be adversely impacted 
in an effort to try to reach profitability in our unix business  we have decreased our operating costs and increased our gross margin percentage in each of the last three fiscal years 
operating costs for our unix business decreased from  for fiscal year to  for fiscal year  and then further decreased to  for fiscal year these cost reductions have primarily been attributable to reduced headcount and continued operational efficiencies generated in our unix business as well as from the consolidation of certain facilities 
during fiscal year  we incurred a charge for severance and exit costs of  and incurred a loss on disposition and write off of long lived assets of  both of these charges negatively impacted our loss from operations for fiscal year in our unix business  we have reduced the number of full time equivalent employees from as of october   to as of october  to as of october  we have taken these headcount reductions and reduced other discretionary spending while still maintaining a worldwide presence 
based on our cost cutting actions  we anticipate that our unix business will generate positive cash flow during fiscal year the decline in our unix business revenue may be accelerated if industry partners withdraw their support as a result of our scosource initiatives 
the decline in our unix business and our scosource initiatives may cause industry partners  developers and hardware and software vendors to choose not to support or certify to our unix operating system products 
this would lead to an accelerated decline in revenue from our unix business 
an important initiative for our unix business for the fiscal year will be the release of a new version of our openserver operating system in the first half of calendar year this new version will provide increased system reliability  backward compatibility with existing applications and software  increased application and hardware support  integration with widely used internet applications and increased system performance 
these enhancements will not have a direct impact on our short term openserver revenue because of the long adoption cycle for new operating system purchases and our long operating system product sales cycle  but we believe that they will help prolong our openserver revenue stream for future quarters 
scosource business 
during the fiscal year  we became aware that our unix code and derivative works had been inappropriately included in the linux operating system 
we believe the inclusion of our unix code and derivative works in linux has been a major contributor to the decline in our unix business because users of linux generally do not pay for the operating system but pay only minimal fees  if any  for service and maintenance 
the linux operating system competes directly with our openserver and unixware products and has taken significant market share from these products 
in an effort to protect our unix intellectual property  we initiated our scosource business 
these initiatives now include seeking to enter into license agreements with unix vendors and offering scosource ip licenses to linux and other end users allowing them to continue to use our unix source code and derivative works found in linux 
our scosource efforts resulted in the execution of two significant vendor license agreements during fiscal year  but we did not enter into any significant vendor license agreements in fiscal year our revenue for fiscal year was significantly lower than revenue generated in fiscal year we believe and allege revenue and related revenue opportunities for fiscal year were adversely impacted by our outstanding dispute with novell over our unix copyright ownership  which may have caused potential customers to delay or forego licensing until an outcome in this legal matter has been reached 
during fiscal year  we began assigning direct resources to the scosource business for sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative 
there were no direct costs associated with selling  marketing  research and development and general and administration for the fiscal year and our scosource business did not exist during fiscal year the following table shows the results of operations for the scosource business in thousands revenue cost of revenue gross margin deficit sales and marketing research and development general and administrative other total operating expenses income loss from operations revenue from our scosource business decreased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year during fiscal year  the revenue generated was primarily attributable to two large vendor licenses  and we did not close any similar transactions during fiscal year revenue in fiscal year was primarily attributable to sales of our scosource ip licenses 
cost of revenue increased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  which was primarily attributable to increased legal fees incurred in connection with our sco litigation 
operating expenses for sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative increased in fiscal year over fiscal year as certain employees were dedicated to this business initiative in fiscal year the other expense in fiscal year of  was attributable to a contingency fee payable to the law firms incurred in connection with the october issuance of our now retired series a convertible preferred stock 
this fee was not for attorney s fees for legal services which fees have been recorded as cost of scosource licensing revenue 
our future success with our scosource initiatives and future revenue from scosource initiatives will depend on our ability to protect our unix intellectual property 
because of the uncertainties related to our scosource business  we are unable to estimate the amount and timing of future scosource licensing revenue 
this uncertainty represents a significant risk and challenge for us  both in the short and long term 
if we do receive revenue from this source  it may be sporadic and fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
our scosource initiatives are unlikely to produce a stable or predictable revenue stream for the foreseeable future 
we are unlikely to generate significant revenue from our scosource business unless and until we prevail in our sco litigation 
additionally  the success of these initiatives may depend on the strength of our intellectual property rights and contractual claims regarding unix  including the strength of our claim that unauthorized unix source code and derivative works are contained in linux 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states and our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations requires us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current trends  future projections  and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following to be our critical accounting estimates because they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and they require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies and estimates include the following revenue recognition  deferred income taxes and related valuation allowances  fair value of derivative financial instrument and our now retired series a convertible preferred stock  severance and exit costs  impairment of long lived assets  and allowances for doubtful accounts 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of accounting position sop  as modified by sop revenue recognition in accordance with these pronouncements is complex due to the nature and variability of our sales transactions 
we recognize products revenue upon shipment if a signed contract exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and product returns are reasonably estimable 
the majority of our revenue transactions relate to product only sales 
on occasion we have revenue transactions that include multiple elements such as products  maintenance  technical support services and other services 
for software agreements that have multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each component of the contract based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
vsoe is established when such elements are sold separately 
we recognize revenue when the criteria for product revenue recognition set forth above have been met 
if vsoe of all undelivered elements exists  but vsoe does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the license fee is recognized as revenue in the period when persuasive evidence of an arrangement is obtained assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
we recognize revenue allocated to undelivered products when the criteria for revenue recognition set forth above have been met 
estimates used in revenue recognition include the determination of credit worthiness of our customers  verification of sales out reporting to end users through our two tier distribution channel and the estimation of potential returns 
in addition to these estimates  we also provide reserves against revenue based on historical trends and experience 
to the extent our estimates are incorrect  or we are not able to maintain vsoe  our recognized revenue could be adversely impacted and would harm our results of operations 
additionally  if our business conditions change or our revenue contracts begin to contain more multiple elements  our revenue recognition in future periods may be impacted because a larger component of revenue may be deferred 
deferred income taxes and related valuation allowance 
the amount  and ultimate realization  of our deferred income tax assets depends  in part  upon the tax laws in effect  our future earnings and other future events  the effects of which cannot be determined 
we have provided a valuation allowance of  against our entire net deferred tax asset as of october  the valuation allowance was recorded because of our history of net operating losses and the uncertainties regarding our future operating profitability and taxable income 
fair value of derivative financial instrument and our retired series a convertible preferred stock 
in october  we issued  shares of our redeemable series a convertible preferred stock 
the terms of the preferred stock included conversion and a number of redemption provisions that represented a derivative financial instrument under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
we determined that the conversion feature was an embedded derivative financial instrument 
as of october   through the assistance of an independent valuation firm  we determined the initial fair value of the derivative was classified as a current liability  and the value of the preferred stock was  we were required to account for the conversion feature as an embedded derivative since the preferred stock instrument did not entitle the holders to equity features such as voting rights and board representation 
as of october   the fair value of the derivative was  and the decrease in fair value of  was recorded as income as a change in fair value of derivative in other income in the statement of operations for fiscal year during fiscal year  the fair value of the derivative decreased and we recorded a total of  as income as a change in fair value of the derivative in other income 
on february   we completed an exchange transaction in which each outstanding series a share was exchanged for one share of redeemable series a convertible preferred stock 
we received no additional proceeds in the exchange 
the exchange transaction eliminated the derivative related to the series a shares that was initially recorded as a current liability on our balance sheet and eliminated the charge in our quarterly statements of operations for the change in the fair value of the derivative related to the series a shares 
through the assistance of an independent valuation firm  we determined the fair value of the series a shares to be  as of february  we recorded a dividend in the second quarter of fiscal year of  which reduced earnings available to common stockholders  related to the difference between the fair value of the series a shares and the carrying value of the previously issued series a shares and related derivative 
this dividend was only one component of the total dividends recorded in fiscal year the estimated fair value of the series a shares as of february  was calculated using a binomial model 
specific assumptions used included years to maturity  percent equivalent bond yield  risk free rate of percent and volatility of percent 
had different assumptions been used  the valuation result could have been different than reported  and that difference could have been material 
as described elsewhere in this filing  we repurchased all outstanding series a shares on july  as of october   no series a shares remain outstanding 
severance and exit costs 
since fiscal year  we have undertaken significant restructuring activities to reduce our ongoing cost of operations 
all restructurings that occurred prior to fiscal year were accounted for in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
for restructuring activities initiated beginning with fiscal year  we have accounted for the one time termination benefits  contract termination costs and other associated costs in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
other severance benefits have been accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
employers accounting for postemployment benefits 
and sfas no 
employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit plans and for termination benefits 
each restructuring has required us to make estimates and assumptions related to losses on vacated facilities  provisions for termination benefits  outplacement costs and other costs 
pursuant to the relevant accounting literature  we may record an accrual for amounts associated with a restructuring that are not paid in the current period 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of the accruals based on changes in estimates 
we may incur future charges for new restructuring activities 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we evaluate  at each balance sheet date  whether events and circumstances have occurred which indicate possible impairment 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated cumulative undiscounted cash flows of the related asset or group of assets is less than the carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair market value of the long lived asset 
we performed an impairment analysis as of april  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and determined that the goodwill and intangible assets related to the vultus technology  which we acquired from vultus  inc vultus in june  had been impaired 
we concluded that an impairment triggering event occurred during the second quarter of fiscal year as we had a reduction in force that impacted our ability to move the vultus initiative forward on a stand alone basis and an anticipated partnership that would have solidified the vultus revenue and cash flow did not materialize 
consequently  we concluded that no significant future cash flows related to our vultus assets would be realized 
as a result of these analyses  we wrote down the carrying value of our goodwill related to the vultus acquisition from  to and wrote down intangible assets related to our vultus acquisition from  to based on continued declines in our operating results  we performed an additional impairment analysis as of october  and determined that the fair value of our remaining intangible assets was in excess of the current carrying values and that no impairment had occurred 
judgment from management is required to determine if a triggering event has occurred and in forecasting future operating results 
write downs of intangible assets may be necessary if the future fair value of these assets is less than carrying value 
if the operating trends for our unix or scosource businesses continue to decline we may be required to record an impairment charge in a future period related to the carrying value of our long lived assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we offer credit terms on the sale of our products to a majority of our customers and require no collateral from these customers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical collection experience and expected collectibility of all accounts receivable and have applied these policies consistently throughout the last three fiscal years 
our allowance for doubtful accounts  which is determined based on our historical experience and a specific review of customer balances  was  as of october  our past experience has resulted in minimal differences from the actual amounts provided for bad debts and our recorded estimates 
however  our actual bad debts in future periods may differ from our current estimates and the differences may be material  which may have an adverse impact on our future accounts receivable and cash position 
results of operations the following table presents our results of operations for the fiscal years ended october   and in thousands years ended october  statement of operations data revenue products scosource licensing services total revenue cost of revenue products scosource licensing services total cost of revenue gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative severance and exit costs amortization of intangibles loss on disposition and impairment of long lived assets write off of investments stock based compensation compensation to law firms total operating expenses income loss from operations equity in income losses of affiliates other income expense  net provision for income taxes net income loss dividends on redeemable convertible preferred stock net income available loss applicable to common stockholders fiscal years ended october   and revenue change change revenue revenue for fiscal year decreased by  or percent  from fiscal year this decrease was primarily attributable to significantly lower scosource licensing revenue in the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year as well as a continued decline in our unix business 
revenue for fiscal year increased by  or percent  from fiscal year  and this increase was primarily attributable to vendor license fees generated from our scosource licensing initiatives offset by decreases in unix products and services revenue 
revenue generated from our unix business and scosource business is as follows change change unix revenue percent of total revenue scosource revenue n a percent of total revenue the decrease in revenue in the unix business of  for fiscal year compared to fiscal year and the decrease of  for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily attributable to continued competition from other operating systems  particularly linux 
we anticipate that for fiscal year our total unix revenue will decline from unix revenue generated in fiscal year the decrease in scosource licensing revenue of  in fiscal year from fiscal year was primarily attributable to minimal vendor licensing revenue in fiscal year compared to significant vendor licensing revenue generated in fiscal year as a result of two large vendor licenses 
sales of our unix products and services during fiscal year were primarily to pre existing customers 
our unix business revenue depends significantly on our ability to market our products to existing customers and to generate upgrades from existing customers 
our unix revenue may be lower than currently anticipated if we are not successful with our existing customers or if we lose the support of any of our existing hardware and software vendors or our key industry partners withdraw their marketing and certification support or direct their support to our competitors 
this may occur as a result of the decline of our unix business and our scosource initiatives 
products revenue change change products revenue percent of total revenue our products revenue consists of software licenses for unix products such as openserver and unixware  as well as sales of unix related products 
products revenue also includes revenue derived from oems  distribution partners and large accounts 
we rely heavily on our two tier distribution channel and any disruption in our distribution channel could have an adverse impact on future revenue 
the decrease in products revenue of  from fiscal year compared to fiscal year and the decrease of  from fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily attributable to decreased sales of openserver and unixware products primarily resulting from increased competition in the operating system market  particularly linux 
we believe that this competition from linux will continue in fiscal year and future periods 
our products revenue was derived primarily from sales of our openserver and unixware products 
other products revenue consists mainly of product maintenance and other unix related products 
revenue for these products was as follows change change openserver revenue percent of products revenue unixware revenue percent of products revenue other products revenue percent of products revenue the decreases in revenue for openserver  unixware and other products are all primarily the result of increased competition  particularly from linux operating system providers 
scosource licensing revenue change change scosource licensing revenue n a percent of total revenue we initiated our scosource business for the purpose of protecting our intellectual property rights in our unix source code and derivative works 
scosource licensing revenue was  in fiscal year  down significantly from revenue of  generated in fiscal year we did not generate any revenue from this source in fiscal year the scosource revenue in fiscal year was primarily attributable to scosource ip license sales and the scosource licensing revenue in fiscal year was primarily attributable to fees associated with two significant vendor licenses 
we believe and allege that our decrease in revenue in fiscal year was in part attributable to our outstanding dispute with novell over our unix copyright ownership  which may have caused potential customers to delay or forego licensing until an outcome in this legal matter has been reached 
we are unable to predict the amount and timing of future scosource licensing revenue  and  when generated  we expect that such revenue will be sporadic 
services revenue change change services revenue percent of total revenue services revenue consists primarily of annual and incident technical support fees  engineering services fees  professional services and consulting fees  and education fees 
these fees are typically charged and invoiced separately from unix products sales 
the decrease in services revenue of  or percent  from fiscal year as compared to fiscal year as well as the decrease in services revenue in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year of  or percent  was in part due to the decrease in products revenue as well as fewer customers renewing services agreements 
the majority of our support and professional services revenue continues to be derived from services for unix based operating system products 
our future level of services revenue depends in part on our ability to generate unix products revenue from new customers as well as to renew annual support and services agreements with existing unix customers 
cost of products revenue change change cost of products revenue percentage of products revenue cost of products revenue consists of manufacturing costs  royalties to third party vendors  technology costs and overhead costs 
cost of products revenue decreased by  or percent  in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year and decreased by  or percent  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year this decrease in cost of products revenue was primarily attributable to lower products revenue  lower manufacturing costs  decreased royalties to third party vendors and lower amortized technology costs 
for fiscal year  we expect the dollar amount of our cost of products revenue to be less than in fiscal year and  as a percentage of products revenue  to be consistent with the percentage achieved during fiscal year cost of scosource licensing revenue change change cost of scosource licensing revenue n a percentage of scosource licensing revenue cost of scosource licensing revenue includes legal and professional fees incurred in connection with our sco litigation  the salaries and related personnel costs of scosource employees  and an allocation of corporate costs 
cost of scosource licensing revenue increased by  or percent  during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the increase in costs in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily attributable to increased legal costs incurred in connection with our sco litigation 
with the completion of the engagement agreement with the law firms representing us in our sco litigation as described elsewhere in this filing  we anticipate that the dollar amount of our cost of scosource licensing for fiscal year will be lower than fiscal year however  future legal fees may include contingency payments made to the law firms as a result of a settlement  judgment  certain licensing fees or a sale of our company  which could cause cost of scosource licensing revenue for fiscal year to be higher than fiscal year cost of services revenue change change cost of services revenue percentage of services revenue cost of services revenue includes the salaries and related personnel costs of employees delivering services revenue as well as third party service agreements 
cost of services revenue decreased by  or percent  for fiscal year compared to fiscal year and decreased by  or percent  for fiscal year compared to fiscal year this decrease was attributable to reduced employee and related costs and the elimination of certain third party support contracts 
for fiscal year  we expect the dollar amount of our cost of services revenue to be less than that incurred in fiscal year and that cost of services revenue as a percentage of services revenue will be lower in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year sales and marketing change change sales and marketing expense percentage of total revenue sales and marketing expenses consist of the salaries  commissions and other personnel costs of employees involved in the revenue generation process  as well as advertising and corporate allocations 
the decrease in sales and marketing expense of  or percent  from fiscal year to fiscal year and the decrease from fiscal year to fiscal year of  or percent  was primarily attributable to reductions in sales and marketing employees  reduced travel expenses  less commissions and lower advertising costs 
sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue increased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year as a result of lower revenue in the fiscal year 
our sales and marketing full time equivalent employees decreased from as of october   to as of october   to as of october  for fiscal year  we anticipate that the dollar amount of sales and marketing expense will decrease from fiscal year research and development change change research and development expense percentage of total revenue research and development expenses consist of the salaries and benefits of software engineers  consulting expenses and corporate allocations 
research and development expense decreased by  or percent  from fiscal year compared to fiscal year during fiscal year our engineering efforts were focused on the release of unixware and the continued development of the next release for our openserver product 
these development efforts required us to maintain our research and development infrastructure which limited our ability to cut costs in this area as significantly as we have done in other areas 
the decrease in research and development expense in fiscal year of  or percent  compared to fiscal year was primarily attributable to work force reductions 
research and development expense as a percentage of revenue increased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year as a result of lower revenue in fiscal year our research and development full time equivalent employees decreased from for fiscal years ended october  and to as of october  for fiscal year  we anticipate that the dollar amount of research and development expenses will decrease from fiscal year general and administrative change change general and administrative expense percentage of total revenue general and administrative expenses consist of the salaries and benefits of finance  human resources  and executive management and expenses for professional services such as legal and accounting services and corporate allocations 
general and administrative expense increased by  or percent  during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to increased legal costs as a result of corporate and regulatory legal matters not classified as cost of scosource licensing revenue and increased fees from other professional service providers 
the decrease in general and administrative expense from fiscal year to fiscal year of  or percent  was primarily attributable to staff centralization 
general and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenue increased in fiscal year as a result of increased costs and lower revenue 
our general and administrative full time equivalent employees decreased from as of october   to as of october   to as of october  for fiscal year  we anticipate that the dollar amount of general and administrative expenses will decrease from fiscal year however  due to the new compliance and reporting regulations under the sarbanes oxley act and other new regulatory requirements  general and administrative expenses may vary as we implement policies and procedures to comply with these new requirements 
severance and exit costs change change severance and exit costs percentage of total revenue during fiscal years  and  we recorded severance and exit costs totaling   and  respectively 
the severance and exit costs for fiscal years  and were comprised of termination payments made to employees in connection with reductions in headcount  closure of certain facilities and adjustments to previously recorded amounts as actual payments made were less than recorded accruals 
the variation in severance and exit costs from fiscal year compared to fiscal year and from fiscal year compared to fiscal year is a result of the number of terminated employees and the size and number of facilities closed 
the detail of the severance and exit costs for fiscal years  and  are as follows in thousands fiscal balance at november  additions adjustments utilization balance at october  one time severance ongoing severance and other facilities total fiscal balance at november  additions adjustments utilization balance at october  one time severance ongoing severance and other facilities total the facilities adjustment of  was the result of successfully negotiating out of lease commitments in connection with our winding down of sco group  ltd 
in the united kingdom 
fiscal balance at november  additions adjustments utilization balance at october  severance and other facilities total the facilities adjustment of  was the result of successfully re negotiating an existing lease commitment 
amounts to be paid for severance and exit costs are included as accrued liabilities 
amortization of intangibles change change amortization of intangibles percentage of total revenue during fiscal years  and  we recorded   and  respectively  for the amortization of intangible assets with finite lives 
the decrease of  or percent  from fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily attributable to reduced amortization expense recorded on certain assets acquired from vultus that were written down to during fiscal year and therefore were not amortized for the last half of fiscal year the increase of  in fiscal year over fiscal year was attributed to amortization expense on assets acquired from vultus 
loss on disposition and impairment of long lived assets change change loss on disposition and write down of long lived assets percentage of total revenue during fiscal years  and  we recorded a write down of long lived assets of   and  respectively 
the loss on disposition and write down of long lived assets recorded in fiscal year primarily related to goodwill and intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of vultus in june we concluded that an impairment triggering event occurred during fiscal year as we had a reduction in force that impacted our ability to move the vultus initiative forward on a stand alone basis and because an anticipated partnership that would have solidified the vultus revenue and cash flow opportunities did not materialize 
consequently  we have concluded that no significant future cash flows related to our vultus assets will be realized 
the loss on disposition and write down of long lived assets recorded in fiscal years and were primarily attributable to assets written off in connection with restructurings that occurred during each fiscal year 
write offs of investments change change write offs of investments n a percentage of total revenue management routinely assesses our investments for impairments and adjusts the carrying amounts to estimated realizable values when impairment has occurred 
during fiscal year  we did not have any write offs of investments 
during fiscal year  in connection with the restructuring of our investment in and relationship with vista 
com  inc vista  we recorded a write off of our vista investment and incurred a charge of  we had been accounting for our investment in vista under the equity method of accounting 
during fiscal year  we determined that the current carrying value of  related to our investment in lineo  inc lineo would not be recovered and was written off 
this write off was due to a significant deterioration in the operating results of lineo and declines in general economic conditions 
this investment had been accounted for under the cost method

all payments to the law firms for legal fees incurred in connection with the sco litigation have been classified as cost of scosource licensing revenue 
equity in income losses of affiliate we account for our ownership interests in companies in which we own at least percent and less than percent using the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method  we record our portion of the entities net income or net loss in our consolidated statements of operations 
as of october   the carrying value of our investments was related to our percent ownership in a chinese company 
during fiscal years  and  we recorded   and  respectively  that related to net income losses in these entities 
the income reported in fiscal year was attributable to our portion of the net income generated by the above mentioned chinese company 
the losses in the and fiscal years were primarily attributable to losses generated from vista 
other income expense  net other income expense consisted of the following components for fiscal years  and in thousands interest income interest expense change in fair value of derivative other expense  net total other income expense  net interest income increased by  from fiscal year to fiscal year and decreased by  from fiscal year to fiscal year the changes in interest income are the result of changes in our cash and available for sale securities balances 
interest expense decreased by  from fiscal year compared to fiscal year as a result of interest expense recorded in the fiscal year on our outstanding note payable to the santa cruz operation 
this note payable was paid during fiscal year the income recorded on the change in fair value of derivative for fiscal year and fiscal year related to the decrease in fair value of this instrument and marking it to market at each balance sheet date 
the derivative financial instrument was eliminated during the second quarter of fiscal year provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was  in fiscal year   in fiscal year and  in fiscal year the increase in the provision for income taxes of  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily attributable to accruals for withholding taxes that are estimated to be paid in connection with the operations of our indian operations 
other than the accrual previously mentioned  our provision for income taxes is primarily related to earnings in foreign subsidiaries 
as of october   we had net operating loss carry forwards for us federal and state income tax reporting purposes of approximately  that expire at various dates between and we had net deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carry forwards and other temporary differences between book and tax deductions  totaling approximately  as of october  we also had net deferred tax liabilities of approximately  related to taxes on foreign earnings 
a valuation allowance in the amount of  the difference between our deferred tax assets and liabilities  has been recorded as of october  as a result of uncertainties regarding the ultimate realizability of the net deferred tax asset balance 
dividends related to series a and series a convertible preferred stock in october  we issued  shares of our series a convertible preferred stock for  per share 
in connection with completing the february  exchange of shares of series a convertible preferred stock for outstanding series a shares  we removed the carrying value of the series a shares and related derivative and recorded the fair value of the series a shares issued in the exchange transaction 
the difference between these two amounts was  and was recorded as a non cash dividend in fiscal year with the completion of the repurchase transaction with baystar capital ii  lp baystar during fiscal year  as a result of which no series a shares remain outstanding  we will not be required to continue to accrue or pay any dividends on the series a shares 
as a result of completing the repurchase transaction with baystar  we recorded a capital contribution in the amount of  which represented the difference in the carrying value of the series a shares and accrued dividends less the fair value of the  shares of common stock and the  in cash 
if the repurchase had not occurred  dividends on the series a shares would have been paid after october   the first anniversary of the original series a private placement  quarterly at a rate of percent per annum  subject to annual increases of percent per annum  not to exceed percent per annum 
we will no longer accrue dividends on preferred stock because the series a shares were repurchased 
no dividends were paid on the series a or series a shares

as a result of the factors listed above and elsewhere in the forward looking statements and factors that may affect future results and financial condition and risk factors section of this form k  it is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may fall below management s expectations as well as the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if revenue falls below management s expectations in any quarter and we are unable to reduce expenses  our operating results will be lower than expected 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and equivalents balance decreased from  as of october  to  as of october  during this same time period  our investment in available for sale securities increased from  to  total cash and equivalents and available for sale securities were  as of october  we also have  classified as a component of restricted cash set aside to cover expert and other costs related to our sco litigation 
during fiscal year  we expended a significant amount of cash for our intellectual property litigation and for our unix business 
during fiscal year  we generated positive cash flow for the first time in our operating history 
this was primarily achieved through significant license revenue generated from our scosource business 
we also received cash in fiscal year from the sale of  shares of our now retired series a convertible preferred stock 
we intend to use the cash and equivalents and available for sale securities as of october  to maintain our unix business and pursue our sco litigation 
we believe that we will have sufficient cash resources to fund our current operations for the next months 
our net cash used in operations during fiscal year was  and was attributable to a net loss of  non cash items of  and changes in operating assets and liabilities of  our working capital decreased from  as of october  to  as of october  our net cash provided by operations during fiscal year was  cash provided by operations was attributable to net income of  non cash items totaled  and changes in operating assets and liabilities of  our long term liabilities decreased from  to  during fiscal year cash used in operations during fiscal year was  and was primarily attributable to the net loss of  partially offset by non cash items of  and cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of  our investing activities have historically consisted of equipment purchases  investing in strategic partners and the purchase and sale of available for sale securities 
during fiscal year  cash used in investing activities was  which was primarily a result of purchases  net of sales  of available for sale securities of  purchases of equipment of  and the purchase of the remaining minority interest in our japanese subsidiary of  during fiscal year  cash used in investing activities was  which was primarily a result of our purchase of available for sale securities of  equipment purchases of  and our investment in non marketable securities of  during fiscal year  cash provided by investing activities was  which was primarily generated from the sale of  of available for sale securities  offset by an investment in a non marketable security of  cash paid for the purchase of equipment of  and payment of  to the santa cruz operation 
our financing activities used  of cash in fiscal year the primary uses of cash were  used for the repurchase and retirement of shares of our series a convertible preferred stock   for the purchase of shares of our common stock on the open market and  paid in connection with the issuance of the series a in exchange for outstanding series a shares 
these uses of cash were offset by proceeds generated from the exercise of options to acquire common stock of  and proceeds of  received from the sale of common stock through the espp 
our financing activities provided  of cash during the fiscal year and consisted primarily of net proceeds of  generated from our issuance of  now retired series a shares 
additional financing activities included proceeds received from the exercise of stock options of  proceeds from the purchase of shares of common stock by our employees through our espp of  and proceeds from the issuance of warrants of  our financing activities used  of cash during fiscal year and consisted primarily of a  payment to retire the note payable to the santa cruz operation and  for the purchase of shares of our common stock held by two investors 
these payments were offset by  of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and  received from employees who purchased shares of our common stock through our employee stock purchase program 
our net accounts receivable balance decreased from  as of october  to  as of october   primarily as a result of lower invoicing and revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year the majority of our accounts receivable are current and our allowance for doubtful accounts was  as of october   which represented approximately percent of our gross accounts receivable balance 
this percentage of gross accounts receivable is consistent with our experience in prior periods  and we expect this trend to continue 
our write offs of uncollectible accounts during fiscal years and were not significant 
on october   we entered into the engagement agreement the law firms 
the engagement agreement supercedes and replaces the original engagement agreement that was entered into in february the engagement agreement governs the relationship between us and the law firms in connection with their representation of us in the sco litigation  through the end of the current litigation between us and ibm 
this litigation is described in more detail under part i  item of this form k 
our purpose in entering into this engagement agreement was to limit the cash expenditures needed to pursue the sco litigation 
the engagement agreement provides for the payment of approximately  for certain previously accrued expenses  totaling  as of october   and all future attorney fees in connection with the sco litigation through the end of the current litigation between us and ibm and the escrow of at least  for the payment of any expert  consulting and other expenses 
as of october   this  was classified as a component of restricted cash 
we paid the  subsequent to october  future legal fees covered under the engagement agreement will require us to pay to the law firms  per quarter for each successive quarter beginning september  and ending december  for a total amount of  of which  will be paid in fiscal year in the first quarter of fiscal year  we made the quarterly payments for september as well as december for a total of  the payment of these fees has had and will continue to have a material impact on our cash position 
in addition to the cash expenditures mentioned above  we must also pay one or more contingency fees upon any amount we or our stockholders may receive as a recovery from our litigation  our intellectual property licensing or a sale of our company 
the contingency fee amounts payable to the law firms will be  subject to certain credits and adjustments  as follows percent of any aggregate recovery amounts received up to  plus percent of any aggregate recovery amounts above  but less than or equal to  plus percent of any aggregate recovery amounts in excess of  the engagement agreement specifically provides that  except for the compensation obligations specifically described above  we will not be obligated to pay any legal fees  whether hourly  contingent or otherwise  to the law firms  or any other law firms that may be engaged by the law firms  in connection with the sco litigation through the end of the current litigation between us and ibm  including any appeals 
we have entered into operating leases for our corporate offices located in the united states and our international sales offices 
we have commitments under these leases that extend through fiscal year the following table summarizes our contractual operating lease obligations and our required payments to the law firms as of october  total less than year years more than years operating lease obligations payments to law firms total obligations as of october   we did not have any long term debt obligations  purchase obligations  other long term liabilities or material capital lease obligations 
our ability to cut costs to offset revenue declines in our unix business is limited because of contractual commitments to maintain and support our existing unix customers 
this decline in our unix business may be accelerated if industry partners withdraw their support as a result of our scosource initiatives 
our scosource initiatives may cause industry partners  developers and hardware and software vendors to choose not to support or certify to our unix operating system products 
this would lead to an accelerated decline in our unix products and services revenue 
if our unix products and services revenue is less than expected  our liquidity will be adversely impacted 
as discussed elsewhere above in part ii  item of this form k and in the section entitled recent sales of unregistered securities above in part ii  item of this form k  we issued shares and granted options under our equity compensation plans without complying with registration or qualification requirements under federal securities laws and the securities laws of certain states 
as a result  certain plan participants have a right to rescind their purchases of shares under the equity compensation plans or recover damages if they no longer own the shares or hold unexercised options  subject to applicable statutes of limitations  and we may make a rescission offer to certain of such plan participants subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals 
additionally  regulatory authorities may require us to pay fines or they may impose other sanctions on us  and we may face other claims by participants other than rescission claims 
if our potential rescission offer is made and accepted by plan participants holding shares acquired under the equity compensation plans or otherwise entitled to recover damages from us in respect of such shares they have sold  or such plan participants otherwise make rescission claims against us  we could be required to make aggregate payments to these plan participants of up to  in the aggregate  excluding interest and other possible fees  based upon shares outstanding under the equity compensation plans as of october  we may also face additional rescission liability to plan participants holding unexercised stock options in california  georgia and possibly other states 
regulatory authorities may require us to pay fines or impose other sanctions on us 
although we believe that it is reasonably possible that some plan participants holding unexercised options may accept a rescission offer or potentially attempt to enforce a rescission right  we are unable to estimate the number of participants who might pursue rescission or the potential rescission liability we may have to them 
since any loss is considered reasonably possible but not estimable  we have not recorded a liability for this contingency 
we may also be required to pay interest and penalties up to statutory limits in connection with plan participants making rescission claims or in connection with any rescission offer 
we believe that it is reasonably possible that we may be required to pay interest and penalties  but are not able to estimate an amount 
in the event that cash required to fund operations and strategic initiatives exceeds our current cash resources and cash generated from operations  we will be required to reduce costs and perhaps raise additional capital 
we may not be able to reduce costs in a manner that does not impair our ability to maintain our unix business and pursue our scosource initiatives 
we may also not be able to raise capital for any number of reasons including those listed under the section risk factors below 
if additional equity financing is available  it may not be available to us on attractive terms and may be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
in addition  if our stock price declines  we may not be able to access the public equity markets on acceptable terms  if at all 
our ability to effect acquisitions for stock would also be impaired

adoption of the provisions of sfas r is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  we have not yet evaluated the potential impact that the adoption of sfas r will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations

pursue scosource licensing opportunities and protect our intellectual property rights  our intention to continue to maintain our core unix business in fiscal year by continuing our research and development efforts  our belief that our openserver and unixware products will continue to provide a revenue stream in fiscal year and our belief that revenue from such products will continue to decline  our expectation that our sales channel should continue to provide reliable unix operating systems for small to medium sized business customers  our intention to focus our development resources on our next openserver product and maintaining our current unixware products  our intention to focus development resources on augmenting our current unix products with other products that

our scosource initiatives will depend on our ability to protect our intellectual property  our intention to vigorously defend legal claims and counterclaims brought against us by others  our intention

continue to pursue our intellectual property claims and that we have sufficient cash reserves to fund our current operations for the next months  our expectation that maintaining our strategic alliances with solution providers in fiscal year will be critical to the success of our unix business and the success of our next openserver product  our intention to keep our relationships with key partners in certain vertical markets  our expectation of entering into future vendor license agreements with developers  manufacturers  distributors and end users of operating systems  our expectation that product enhancements to improve our unix technology will extend the life and improve the functionality of our unix products and our belief that such improvements will not result in significant revenue increases  our belief that such product enhancements to our unix technology will help prolong our openserver revenue stream for future quarters  our intention to continue to review the status of our existing unix license agreements with unix vendors in fiscal year  our intention to continue to pursue our ip licensing initiative against those that may be violating our unix copyrights  our expectation that our unix business will generate positive cash flow during fiscal year  our belief that our allowance and bad debts for accounts receivable will remain consistent with our prior experience  the strength of our intellectual property rights and contractual claims regarding unix generally and specifically the strength of our claim that unauthorized unix source code and derivatives of unix source code are contained in linux  our expectation that total unix revenue for fiscal year will decline from unix revenue generated in fiscal year our belief that competition from linux will continue in fiscal year and future periods  our expectation that we will continue to be unable to predict the amount and timing of scosource licensing revenue  and when generated  the revenue will be sporadic  our expectation that future services revenue will depend in part on our ability to generate unix products revenue from new customers as well as the renewal of annual support and services agreements from existing unix customers  our expectation for fiscal year that the dollar amount of our cost of products revenue will be lower than fiscal year our expectation for fiscal year that the dollar amount of our cost of scosource licensing revenue will be lower than fiscal year  our expectation for fiscal year that the dollar amount of our cost of services revenue will be lower than fiscal year our expectation for fiscal year that the dollar amount of our sales and marketing expenses will be lower than fiscal year  our expectation for fiscal year that the dollar amount

year  our belief that our legal costs related to our intellectual property litigation will decrease in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  exclusive of any contingent payments  our belief that our facilities are adequate for our business  and our belief that certain legal actions to which we are a party will not have a material adverse effect on us 
we wish to caution readers that our operating results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those discussed or anticipated  including the success of our scosource initiatives  competition from other operating systems  particularly linux  the amount and timing of scosource licensing revenue  our ability to enhance our unix operating systems and maintain our unix business  and the factors set forth in the subsection entitled risk factors below 
we also wish to advise readers not to place any undue reliance on the forward looking statements contained in this report  which reflect our beliefs and expectations only as of the date of this report 
we assume no obligation to update or revise these forward looking statements to reflect new events or circumstances or any changes in our beliefs or expectations  other than as required by law 
risk factors we do not have a history of profitable operations 
our fiscal year ended october  was the first full year we were profitable in our operating history 
our profitability in fiscal year resulted primarily from our scosource licensing initiatives 
for fiscal year  we incurred a net loss from operations of  and our accumulated deficit as of october  was  if we do not receive scosource licensing revenue in future quarters and our revenue from the sale of our unix products and services continues to decline  we will need to further reduce operating expenses to generate positive cash flow 
we may not be able to further reduce operating expenses without damaging our ability to support our existing unix business 
additionally  we may not be able to achieve profitability through additional cost cutting actions 
our unix products and services revenue has declined over the last several years primarily as a result of increased competition from alternative operating systems  particularly linux 
in our quarterly results of operations  we recognize revenue from agreements for support and maintenance contracts and other long term contracts that have been previously invoiced and are included in deferred revenue 
our future unix revenue may be adversely impacted and may continue to decline if we are unable to replenish these deferred revenue balances with long term maintenance and support contracts or replace them with other sustainable revenue streams 
if we are unable to generate positive cash flow and profitable operations  our operations will be adversely impacted 
we may not prevail in our sco litigation  which may adversely affect our business 
we continue to pursue our sco litigation as described in more detail in item of part i of this form k and believe very strongly in the merits of our cases 
in our action against ibm  we seek damages for claims generally relating to our allegation that ibm has inappropriately used and distributed our unix source code and derivative works in connection with its efforts to promote the linux operating system 
ibm has responded to our claims and brought counterclaims against us asserting generally that we do not have the right to assert claims based on our ownership of unix intellectual property against ibm or others in the linux market 
discovery is continuing in the case  and several motions are currently pending before the court 
if we do not prevail in our action against ibm  or if ibm is successful in its counterclaims against us  our business and results of operations would be materially harmed and we may not be able to continue in business 
the litigation with ibm and others will be costly  and our costs for legal fees have been and will continue to be substantial and may exceed our capital resources 
additionally  the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected as a result of developments in our legal action against ibm that may be  or may be perceived to be  adverse to us 
as a result of our sco litigation and our other scosource initiatives  several participants in the linux industry and others affiliated with ibm or sympathetic to the linux movement have taken actions attempting to negatively affect our business and our scosource efforts 
linux proponents have taken a broad range of actions against us  including  for example  attempting to influence participants in the markets in which we sell our products to reduce or eliminate the amount of our products and services they purchase from us 
we expect that similar efforts likely will continue 
there is a risk that participants in our marketplace will negatively view our action against ibm  novell  daimlerchrysler  and autozone and our other scosource initiatives  and we may lose support from such participants 
any of the foregoing could adversely affect our position in the marketplace  our results of operations and our stock price and our ability to stay in business 
we have also experienced several denial of service attacks on our website  which have prevented web users from accessing our website and doing business with us for a period of time 
if such attacks continue or if our customers and strategic partners are also subjected to similar attacks  our business and results of operations could be materially harmed 
in addition  some of the more significant participants in the linux industry have made efforts to ease linux end users concerns that their use of linux may subject them to potential copyright infringement claims from us 
as a further response to our scosource initiatives and claim that our unix source code and derivative works have inappropriately been included in linux  novell has publicly asserted its belief that it owns certain copyrights in our unix source code  and it has filed copyright applications with the united states copyright office related to unix 
novell also claims that it has a license to unix from us and the right to authorize its customers to use unix technology in their internal business operations 
specifically  novell has also claimed to have retained rights related to legacy unix svrx licenses  including the license with ibm 
novell asserts it has the right to take action on behalf of sco in connection with such licenses  including termination and waiver rights 
novell has purported to veto our termination of the ibm  sequent and sgi licenses 
we have repeatedly asserted that we obtained the unix business  source code  claims and copyrights when we acquired the assets and operations of the server and professional services groups from the santa cruz operation now tarantella  inc in may  which had previously acquired all such assets and rights from novell in september pursuant to an asset purchase agreement  as amended 
in january  in response to novell s actions  we brought suit against novell for slander of title seeking relief for novell s alleged bad faith effort to interfere with our copyrights and contract rights related to our unix source code and derivative works and our unixware products 
our lawsuit against novell is also described in more detail in item of part i of this form k 
notwithstanding our assertions of full ownership of unix related intellectual property rights  as set forth above  including copyrights  and even if we are successful in our legal action against novell and end users such as autozone and daimlerchrysler  the efforts of novell and the other linux proponents described above may cause linux end users to be less willing to purchase from us our scosource ip licenses authorizing their use of our intellectual property contained in the linux operating system  which has and may continue to adversely affect our revenue from our scosource initiatives 
these efforts of linux proponents also may increase the negative view some participants in our marketplace have regarding our sco litigation and regarding our scosource initiatives and may contribute to creating confusion in the marketplace about the validity of our claim that the unauthorized use of our unix source code and derivative works in linux infringes on our copyrights 
increased negative perception and potential confusion about our claims in our marketplace could impede our continued pursuit of our scosource initiatives and negatively impact our business 
our failure to timely file this form k  and our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended january  as previously defined  the form q  could result in the delisting of our common stock on the nasdaq smallcap market 
we received notice on february  from the nasdaq stock market that  due to the delay in filing this form k  we were not  as of such date  in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing set forth in marketplace rule c  and that our common stock is  therefore  subject to delisting at the opening of business on february  we requested and participated in a hearing with the nasdaq listing qualifications panel on march  at the hearing  we outlined for the panel our plan for filing this form k and the form q  which also was not filed in a timely fashion 
on march   we received a notice from the nasdaq stock market regarding our potential delisting as a result of our failure to file the form q in a timely fashion 
the notice informed us that the panel will consider the filing delinquency of our form q in addition to the filing delinquency of this form k in rendering its decision regarding our listing status 
we will continue to be listed on the nasdaq smallcap market under the symbol scoxe pending the issuance of the panel s decision 
although we have filed this form k  we have not yet filed the form q  and there can be no assurance that nasdaq will not act to delist our common stock from the nasdaq smallcap stock market 
our engagement agreement with the law firms will require us to spend a significant amount of cash during fiscal year and could harm our liquidity position 
as of october   we had a total of  in cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities and an additional  as restricted cash to be used in our operations and pursue the sco litigation 
as a result of the engagement agreement between us and the law firms  as described elsewhere in this filing  we anticipate using cash of approximately  in the defense of our intellectual property litigation during fiscal year  which would leave us approximately  in cash for our business operations 
we expect that our unix business will generate sufficient cash in fiscal year to cover our internal costs related to our scosource initiatives and intellectual property litigation 
however  if our unix business does not generate cash or we spend additional cash on the sco litigation or additional matters  our cash position would be negatively impacted  and our ability to pursue our unix business objectives and our sco litigation would be harmed 
our future scosource licensing revenue is uncertain 
we initiated the scosource licensing effort in fiscal year to review the status of unix licensing and sublicensing agreements 
this effort resulted in the execution of two significant vendor license agreements during fiscal year and generated  in revenue 
during fiscal year  our scosource licensing revenue declined significantly and was only  due to a lack of historical experience and the uncertainties related to scosource licensing revenue  we are unable to estimate the amount and timing of future scosource licensing revenue  if any 
if we do receive revenue from this source  it may be sporadic and fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
our scosource initiatives are unlikely to produce stable  predictable revenue for the foreseeable future 
additionally  the success of these initiatives may depend on the strength of our intellectual property rights and contractual claims regarding unix  including the strength of our claim that unauthorized unix source code and derivatives are prevalent in linux 
we may lose the support of industry partners leading to an accelerated decline in our unix products and services revenue 
the decline in our unix business and our scosource initiatives may cause industry partners  developers and hardware and software vendors to choose not to support or certify to our unix operating system products 
this would lead to an accelerated decline in our unix products and services revenue and would adversely impact our results of operations and liquidity 
our claims relating to our unix intellectual property may subject us to additional legal proceedings 
in august  red hat brought a lawsuit against us asserting that the linux operating system does not infringe on our unix intellectual property rights and seeking a declaratory judgment for non infringement of copyrights and no misappropriation of trade secrets 
in addition  red hat claims we have engaged in false advertising in violation of the lanham act  deceptive trade practices  unfair competition  tortious interference with prospective business opportunities  and trade libel and disparagement 
although this case is currently stayed pending the resolution of our suit against ibm  we intend to vigorously defend this action 
however  if red hat is successful in its claim against us  our business and results of operations could be materially harmed 
in addition  regulators or others in the linux market and some foreign regulators have initiated or in the future may initiate legal actions against us  all of which may negatively impact our operations and future operating performance 
fluctuations in our operating results or the failure of our operating results to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors may negatively impact our stock price 
fluctuations in our operating results or our failure to meet the expectations of analysts or investors  even in the short term  could cause our stock price to decline significantly 
because of the potential for significant fluctuations in our scosource licensing revenue in any particular period  you should not rely on comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of future performance 
factors that may affect our results include our ability to successfully negotiate and complete licensing and other agreements related to our intellectual property  the interest level of resellers in recommending our unix business solutions to end users  the introduction  development  timing  competitive pricing and market acceptance of our products and services and those of our competitors  changes in general economic conditions  such as recessions  that could affect capital expenditures in the software industry  results of  or developments in our sco litigation  changes in business attitudes toward unix as a viable operating system compared to other competing systems  especially linux  the contingency and other legal fees we may pay to the law firms representing us in our efforts to establish our intellectual property rights  and changes in attitudes of customers and partners due to the decline in our unix business and our aggressive position against the inclusion of our unix code and derivative works in linux 
we also experience fluctuations in operating results in interim periods in europe and the asia pacific regions due to seasonal slowdowns and economic conditions in these areas 
seasonal slowdowns in these regions typically occur during the summer months 
as a result of the factors listed above and elsewhere  it is possible that our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in any particular period 
this could cause our stock price to decline 
if revenue falls below our expectations and we are unable to quickly reduce our spending in response  our operating results will be lower than expected 
our stock price may fall in response to these events 
we operate in a highly competitive market and face significant competition from a variety of current and potential sources  many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial and technical resources than we do  thus  we may fail to compete effectively 
in the operating system market  our competitors include ibm  red hat  novell  hewlett packard  sun  microsoft and other linux distributors 
these and other competitors are aggressively pursuing the current unix operating system market 
many of these competitors have access to substantially greater resources than we do 
the major competitive alternative to our unix products is linux 
the expansion of our competitors offerings may restrict the overall market available for our unix products  including some markets where we have been successful in the past 
our future success may depend in part on our ability to continue to meet the increasing needs of our customers by supporting existing and emerging technologies 
if we do not enhance our products to meet these evolving needs  we may not remain competitive and be able to grow our business 
additionally  because technological advancement in the unix operating system market and alternative operating system markets is progressing at an advanced pace  we will have to develop and introduce enhancements to our existing products and any new products on a timely basis to keep pace with these developments  evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements 
our failure to meet any of these and other competitive pressures may render our existing products and services obsolete  which would have an adverse impact on our revenue and operations 
the success of our unix business will depend on the level of commitment and certification we receive from industry partners and developers 
in recent years  we have seen hardware and software vendors as well as software developers turn their certification and application development efforts toward linux and elect not to continue to support or certify to our unix operating system products 
if this trend continues  our competitive position will be adversely impacted and our future revenue from our unix business will decline 
the decline in our unix business may be accelerated if industry partners withdraw their support from us for any reason  including our scosource initiatives 
if the market for unix continues to contract  our business will be harmed 
our revenue from the sale of unix products has declined over the last several years 
this decrease in revenue has been attributable primarily to increased competition from other operating systems  particularly linux 
our sales of unix products and services are primarily to existing customers 
if the demand for unix products continues to decline  and we are unable to develop unix products and services that successfully address a market demand  our unix revenue will continue to decline  industry participants may not certify to our operating system and products  we may not be able to attract new customers or retain existing customers and our business and results of operations will be adversely affected 
because of the long adoption cycle for operating system purchases and the long sales cycle of our operating system products  we may not be able to reverse these revenue declines quickly 
we rely on our indirect sales channel for distribution of our products  and any disruption of our channel at any level could adversely affect the sales of our products 
we have a two tiered distribution channel 
the relationships we have developed with resellers allow us to offer our products and services to a much larger customer base than we would otherwise be able to reach through our own direct sales and marketing efforts 
some solution providers also purchase solutions through our resellers  and we anticipate they will continue to do so 
because we usually sell indirectly through resellers  we cannot control the relationships through which resellers  solution providers or equipment integrators purchase our products 
in turn  we do not control the presentation of our products to end users 
therefore  our sales could be affected by disruptions in the relationships between us and our resellers  between our resellers and solution providers  or between solution providers and end users 
also  resellers and solution providers may choose not to emphasize our products to their customers 
any of these occurrences could diminish the effectiveness of our distribution channel and lead to decreased sales 
our engagement agreement with the law firms representing us to enforce our intellectual property rights may reduce our ability to raise additional financing 
our engagement agreement with the law firms could inhibit our ability to raise additional funding if needed 
although under the engagement agreement our obligations to the law firms are limited to approximately  related to certain previously accrued and all future attorney fees and the escrow of  for the payment of any expert  consulting and other expenses to pursue the sco litigation  the agreement provides that the law firms will receive a contingency fee that may range from to percent of the proceeds from specified events related to the protection of our intellectual property rights 
events triggering a contingency fee may include settlements or judgments related to the sco litigation  certain licensing fees  subject to certain exceptions  and a sale of our company 
future payments payable to the law firms under this arrangement will be significant 
the law firms right to receive such contingent payments could cause prospective investors to choose not to invest in our company or limit the price at which new investors would be willing to provide additional funds to our company 
our foreign based operations and sales create special problems  including the imposition of governmental controls and taxes and fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could hurt our results 
we have foreign operations  including development facilities  sales personnel and customer support operations in europe  latin america and asia 
these foreign operations are subject to certain inherent risks  including potential loss of developed technology through piracy  misappropriation  or more lenient laws regarding intellectual property protection  imposition of governmental controls  including trade restrictions and other tax requirements  fluctuations in currency exchange rates and economic instability  longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries  and seasonal reductions in business activity 
in addition  certain of our operating expenses are denominated in local currencies  creating risk of foreign currency translation losses that could harm our financial results and cash flows 
when we generate profits in foreign countries  our effective income tax rate is increased 
in latin america and asia in particular  several countries have suffered and may be especially susceptible to recessions and economic instability  which may lead to increased governmental ownership or regulation of the economy  higher interest rates  increased barriers to entry such as higher tariffs and taxes  and reduced demand for goods manufactured in the united states  resulting in lower revenue 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  our indian office was given a withholding tax assessment from the government of india income tax department 
the tax department assessed a percent withholding tax on certain revenue transactions in india that the tax department deemed royalty revenue under the income tax act 
we have filed an appeal with the tax department and believe that our packaged software does not qualify for treatment as royalties and therefore would not be subject to withholding tax 
however  we may be unsuccessful in our appeal against the tax department and be obligated to pay the assessed taxable amounts 
if other countries in which we have international operations  such as india  continue to develop and begin enforcing their tax regimes  we may be subject to withholding or other taxes 
if we are unable to retain key personnel in an intensely competitive environment  our operations could be adversely affected 
we need to retain our management  technical  and support personnel 
competition for qualified professionals in the software industry is intense  and departures of existing personnel could be disruptive to our business and might result in the departure of other employees 
the loss or departure of any officers or key employees could harm our ability to implement our business plan and could adversely affect our operations 
our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued service and coordination of our management team  particularly darl c 
mcbride  our president and chief executive officer 
we have issued shares and options under our equity compensation plans that were not exempt from registration or qualification under federal and state securities laws  and  as a result  we may incur liability to repurchase such shares and options and may face additional potential claims under federal and state securities laws 
we have issued certain shares and granted options under the equity compensation plans without complying with registration or qualification requirements under federal securities laws and the securities laws of certain states 
as a result  certain plan participants that have acquired shares issued under the equity compensation plans have rescission rights against us  subject to applicable statutes of limitations  and we may  subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals  make a rescission offer to certain of such plan participants 
additionally  regulatory authorities may require us to pay fines or they may impose other sanctions on us  and we may face other claims by plan participants other than rescission claims 
if our potential rescission offer is made and accepted by plan participants holding shares acquired under the equity compensation plans or otherwise entitled to recover damages from us in respect of such shares they have sold  or such plan participants otherwise make rescission claims against us  we could be liable to make aggregate payments to these plan participants of up to  in the aggregate  excluding interest and other possible fees  based upon shares outstanding under the plans as of october  we may face additional rescission liability to plan participants holding unexercised stock options in california  georgia and possibly other states 
additionally  federal securities laws do not provide that a rescission offer will terminate a plan participant s right to rescind a sale of stock that was not registered as required  and our possible rescission offer may not terminate a plan participant s right to rescind a sale of stock that was not registered as required under federal law 
if we do not make the planned rescission offer to all plan participants  or any or all of the offerees reject the rescission offer  we may continue to be subject to rescission risk under federal and state securities laws 
our stock price is volatile 
the trading price for our common stock has been volatile  ranging from a low closing sales price of in mid february  to a high closing sales price of per share in october  to a current sales price of on march  the share price has changed dramatically over short periods 
we believe that the changes in our stock price are affected by changing public perceptions concerning the strength of our intellectual property claims and other factors beyond our control 
public perception can change quickly and without any change or development in our underlying business or litigation position 
an investment in our stock is subject to such volatility and  consequently  is subject to significant risk 
there are risks associated with the potential exercise of our outstanding options 
as of march   we have issued and outstanding options to purchase up to approximately  shares of common stock with an average exercise price of per share 
the existence of such rights to acquire common stock at fixed prices may prove a hindrance to our efforts to raise future equity and debt funding  and the exercise of such rights will dilute the percentage ownership interest of our stockholders and may dilute the value of their ownership 
the possible future sale of shares issuable on the exercise of outstanding options could adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock 
further  the holders of the outstanding rights may exercise them at a time when we would otherwise be able to obtain additional equity capital on terms more favorable to us 
the resale of common shares by baystar may have an adverse impact on the market value of our stock and the existing holders of our common stock 
we previously had an effective registration statement on form s relating to the sale or distribution by baystar as a selling stockholder of the  shares of common stock issued to baystar in connection with our repurchase completed in july of all series a shares previously held by baystar 
when we failed to file this form k in a timely fashion  we became ineligible to use form s  our registration statement ceased to be effective and baystar s ability to resell shares pursuant to that registration statement terminated 
we are currently in the process of preparing a new registration statement for the resale of baystar s shares on form s upon that registration statement being declared effective by the sec  baystar will again be able to resell its shares 
we will not receive any proceeds from the sales of the shares covered by such registration statement 
the shares that may be sold or distributed pursuant to such registration statement  upon being declared effective by the sec  will represent approximately percent of our issued and outstanding common stock 
the sale of the block of stock to be covered by such registration statement  or even the possibility of its sale  may adversely affect the trading market for our common stock and reduce the price available in that market 
our stock price could decline further because of the activities of short sellers 
our stock has attracted the interest of short sellers 
the activities of short sellers could further reduce the price of our stock or inhibit increases in our stock price 
the right of our board of directors to authorize additional shares of preferred stock could adversely impact the rights of holders of our common stock 
our board of directors currently has the right  with respect to the  shares of our preferred stock  to authorize the issuance of one or more additional series of our preferred stock with such voting  dividend and other rights as our directors determine 
the board of directors can designate new series of preferred stock without the approval of the holders of our common stock 
the rights of holders of our common stock may be adversely affected by the rights of any holders of additional shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future  including without limitation  further dilution of the equity ownership percentage of our holders of common stock and their voting power if we issue preferred stock with voting rights 
additionally  the issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
our stockholder rights plan could make it more difficult for a hostile bid for the company or a change of control transaction to succeed at current market prices for our stock 
we have adopted a stockholder rights plan rights plan 
the power given to the board of directors by the rights plan may make it more difficult for a change of control of our company to occur or for the company to be acquired when the acquisition is opposed by our board of directors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
we have foreign offices and operations in europe and asia 
as a result  a portion of our revenue is derived from sales to customers outside the united states 
our international revenue is denominated in us dollars  euros and united kingdom pounds 
most of the operating expenses related to our foreign based operations are denominated in foreign currencies and therefore operating results are affected by changes in the us dollar exchange rate in relation to foreign currencies such as the euro  among others 
if the us dollar further weakens compared to the euro  our operating expenses for foreign operations will be higher when translated back into us dollars 
our revenue can also be affected by general economic conditions in the united states  europe and other international markets 
our results of operations may be affected in the short term by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have in the past utilized foreign currency forward exchange contracts for market exposures of underlying assets and liabilities 
we do not use forward exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
our accounting policies for foreign exchange contracts are based on our designation of each contract 
the criteria we use for designating each contract include such contract s effectiveness in risk reduction and one to one matching of forward exchange contracts to underlying assets and liabilities 
gains and losses on currency forward contracts that are firm commitments are deferred and recognized in income in the same period that the underlying transactions are settled 
gains and losses on currency forward contracts that are designated and effective for existing transactions are recognized in income in the same period as losses and gains on the underlying transactions are recognized and generally offset 
gains and losses on any instruments not meeting the above criteria are recognized in income in the current period 
as of october   we had no outstanding instruments classified as hedges 
interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our cash management strategy is to invest available funds in a manner that assures maximum safety and liquidity and maximizes yield within such constraints 
we believe that a hypothetical movement in interest rates  either up or down  would not have a material adverse impact on our cash and equivalent sand available for sale securities 
we do not borrow money for short term investment purposes 
investment risk 
we have invested in equity instruments of privately held and public companies in the technology industry for business and strategic purposes 
investments are accounted for under the cost method if our ownership is less than percent and we are not able to exercise influence over operations 
our investment policy is to regularly review the assumptions and operating performance of these companies and to record impairment losses when events and circumstances indicate that these investments may be impaired 
as of october   our investments balance was approximately  and was related to our investment in a percent owned chinese company 
the stock market in general  and the market for shares of technology companies in particular  has experienced price fluctuations 
in addition  factors such as new product introductions by our competitors or developments in the litigation related to our scosource initiatives may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
furthermore  quarter to quarter fluctuations in our results of operations may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
these conditions could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially over short periods of time
