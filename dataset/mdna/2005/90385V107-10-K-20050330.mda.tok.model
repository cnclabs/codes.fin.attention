item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a developer and supplier of critical subsystems for the semiconductor capital equipment industry  focusing  primarily  on gas delivery systems 
we generate revenue primarily from the sale of these gas delivery systems and other subassemblies by providing our customers with a full range of services for the development  design  prototyping  engineering  manufacturing and testing of our subassembly products 
because our customers are primarily oems of semiconductor capital equipment  the success of our business and our ability to generate future revenues depends on oems continuing to outsource the manufacturing of gas delivery systems and other subassemblies for their semiconductor capital equipment 
while most of the largest oems have already outsourced a significant portion of their gas delivery systems  other subassemblies  such as frames  chamber top plates and process modules are being increasingly outsourced by our oem customers 
we have recently begun to expand our product base using our existing expertise by taking on other subassembly business as these products are identified for outsourcing 
in the second quarter of we began to build frame assemblies for one of our customers and in the fourth quarter of we increased our sales of frame assemblies and also shipped our first top plate assembly products 
we are also pursuing other product markets such as process modules  liquid delivery systems and catalytic steam generation systems 
in  we also expanded our business into asia by leasing a new manufacturing facility and completing the construction of a new  square foot clean room in shanghai  china 
through this facility  we intend to service our existing customers and pursue relationships with new asian customers 
we expect to begin shipping products from our shanghai facility in march in addition to growing our business organically  we also regularly consider strategic acquisitions that we believe will enable us to expand our geographic reach  secure new customers  diversify into complementary product markets and broaden our technological capabilities and product offerings 
fp ultra clean  llc  an entity controlled by francisco partners  lp  owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
pursuant to the terms of a stockholder s agreement with fp ultra clean  llc  our board of directors may not take certain significant actions without the approval of fp ultra clean  llc as long as it owns at least of our outstanding common stock  including mergers  acquisitions or sales of assets outside the ordinary course of business  the issuance of securities and the incurrence or refinancing of indebtedness in excess of million 
cyclical business our business and operating results depend in significant part upon capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductors  which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical  with recurring periods of over supply of semiconductor products that have had a severe negative effect on the demand for capital equipment used to 
table of contents manufacture semiconductors 
during these periods  we have experienced significant fluctuations in customer orders for our products 
our sales were million in  million in and million in beginning in the third quarter of  we started to experience a weakening in new orders and customer requests for cancellations and postponements of existing orders that continued throughout the remainder of and is likely to continue into at least the first half of in periods where supply exceeds demand for semiconductor capital equipment  we generally experience significant reductions in customer orders for our products 
sharp decreases in demand for semiconductor capital equipment may lead our customers to cancel order forecasts  change production quantities from forecasted volumes or delay production  which may negatively impact our gross profit  as we may be unable to quickly reduce costs and may be required to hold inventory longer than anticipated 
in periods where demand for semiconductor capital equipment exceeds supply  we generally need to quickly increase our production of gas delivery systems  requiring us to order additional inventory  effectively manage our component supply chain  hire additional employees and expand  if necessary  our manufacturing capacity 
customer concentration a relatively small number of oem customers have historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenue  and we expect this trend to continue 
applied materials  inc  lam research corporation and novellus systems  inc as a group accounted for of our sales in  of our sales in  and of our sales in during we began shipping gas delivery systems to two new customers 
basis of presentation our financial statements include the accounts of the successor company  ultra clean holdings  inc and its subsidiaries  since inception including for the years ended december  and and for the period from november  through december  and the accounts of the predecessor of our business  ultra clean technology service and systems  inc  prior to november  effective january   we adopted a week fiscal year ending on the friday nearest to december for presentation purposes  we present each fiscal year as if it ended on december using the year end  fiscal year ended on december  representing weeks 
fiscal year ended on december  all references to years refer to fiscal years 
in the discussion of our financial statements for the year ended december  in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we refer to the financial statements for as combined for comparative purposes 
these combined financial results for represent the sum of the financial data for ultra clean technology systems and service  inc predecessor for the period from january  through november  and the financial data for ultra clean holdings  inc ultra clean for the period from its inception to december  we further refer to the period from our inception through december  as the november  through december  period  because we had no operations in the period from october   our date of incorporation  to november   the closing date of the ultra clean acquisition 
these combined financial results are for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent what our financial position would have actually been in such periods had the ultra clean acquisition occurred prior to november  critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure at the date of our financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to sales  inventories  intangible assets  stock compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we consider certain 
table of contents accounting policies related to the ultra clean acquisition  revenue recognition  inventory valuation  accounting for income taxes  valuation of intangible assets and goodwill and stock options to employees to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each 
ultra clean acquisition in connection with the ultra clean acquisition  we allocated the purchase price associated with the acquisition to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed and in process research and development based on their estimated fair values 
we engaged a third party appraisal firm to assist us in determining the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
such valuations required us to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
estimates associated with the accounting for the ultra clean acquisition were made based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain 
the critical estimates we used in allocating the purchase price and valuing certain intangible assets include but were not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists  distribution agreements  acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop in process research and development into commercially viable products and brand awareness and market position of acquired products and assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in the combined product portfolio 
our estimates of fair value were based upon assumptions that we believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
revenue recognition our revenue is concentrated in a few oem customers in the semiconductor capital equipment and flat panel display industry 
our standard arrangement for our customers includes a signed purchase order or contract  no right of return of delivered products and no customer acceptance provisions 
revenue from sales of products is recognized when we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer  we ship the products  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  and collection is probable 
revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of the product 
in arrangements which specify title transfer upon delivery  revenue is not recognized until the product is delivered 
in addition  if we have not substantially completed a product or fulfilled the terms of the agreement at the time of shipment  revenue recognition is deferred until completion 
determination of criteria in the third and fourth bullet points above is based on our judgment regarding the fixed nature of the amounts charged for the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts 
we assess collectability based on the creditworthiness of the customer and past transaction history 
we perform on going credit evaluations of  and do not require collateral from  our customers 
we have not experienced collection losses in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one customer could make it more difficult for us to assess collectability 
inventory valuation we value our inventories at the lesser of standard cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
we assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts on a periodic basis 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of our estimated usage is written down to its estimated market value less costs to sell  if less than its cost 
the inventory write downs are recorded as an inventory valuation allowance established on the basis of obsolete inventory or specific identified inventory in excess of established usage 
inherent in our estimates of market value in determining inventory valuation are 
table of contents estimates related to economic trends  future demand for our products and technological obsolescence of our products 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required 
if the inventory value is written down to its net realizable value  and subsequently there is an increased demand for the inventory at a higher value  the increased value of the inventory is not realized until the inventory is sold either as a component of a gas delivery system or as separate inventory 
accounting for income taxes income taxes are provided for using an asset and liability approach 
the determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets  which is made up primarily of tax deductions  assumes we will be able to generate sufficient future income to fully realize these deductions 
in determining whether the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired  we make judgments with respect to whether we are likely to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize these assets 
we have not recorded any valuation allowance to impair our tax assets because  based on the available evidence  we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize all of our deferred tax assets in the future 
if we do not generate sufficient future income  the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired  resulting in an additional income tax expense 
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill we periodically evaluate our intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets include goodwill  purchased technology and tradename 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
the provisions of sfas no 
also require an annual goodwill impairment test or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill  the provisions of sfas no 
require the application of a fair value based test at the reporting unit level 
we operate in one segment and have one reporting unit 
therefore  all goodwill is considered enterprise goodwill and the first step of the impairment test prescribed by sfas no 
requires a comparison of our fair value to our book value 
if the estimated fair value is less than the book value  sfas no 
requires an estimate of the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of the business  in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business 
this estimate requires valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as in process research and development and developed technology 
potential goodwill impairment is measured based upon this two step process 
we performed the annual goodwill impairment test as of december  and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
stock options to employees we have elected to follow the intrinsic value based method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and the related interpretations in accounting for employee stock options rather than adopting the alternative fair value accounting provided under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
therefore  we do not record any compensation expense for stock options we grant to our employees where the exercise price equals the fair market value of the stock options on the date of grant and the exercise price  number of shares eligible for issuance under the options and vesting period are fixed 
we comply with the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 which require that we disclose our pro forma net income or loss and net income or loss per common share as if we had expensed the fair value of the options 
in calculating such fair values  we use assumptions of estimated option life  dividend policy and interest rates 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revision to sfas no 
sfas r 
under sfas r  we will be required to record this compensation expense in our results of operations 
sfas r is effective for the beginning of the first fiscal reporting period that 
table of contents begins after june  we anticipate the adoption of sfas r will have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations beginning in the third quarter of results of operations the following table sets forth statements of operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of revenue 
year ended december  combined sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative stock and other deferred compensation in process research and development total operating expenses income from operations interest expense and other  net income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss the combined financial results for represent the sum of the financial data for ultra clean technology systems and service  inc predecessor for the period from january  through november  and the financial data for ultra clean holdings  inc for the period from november  inception to december  the combined financial data for is presented to facilitate comparison with other annual periods 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  overview net sales for the year ended december  as compared to net sales for the prior year grew by million or 
the year over year increase was primarily attributable to the significant increase in sales during the first half of compared to the end of in the middle of the third quarter of fiscal  however  we experienced a reduction in demand for our products by most of our customers due to a general softening in demand throughout the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
thus  sales in the second half of  compared to the first half of  declined and our gross profit also declined  primarily due to lower sales and manufacturing volumes 
through cost reduction actions  however  including reducing our workforce by in the third quarter and a portion of our workforce taking mandatory time off during the fourth quarter of  the decline in gross profit was somewhat mitigated 
operating expenses in compared to increased by million  or 
administrative costs related to becoming a public company  increased sales and business activity  and startup expenses relating to our new shanghai  china facility contributed to this increase 
also  we incurred approximately million in 
table of contents expenses due to a potential acquisition  discussions with which were terminated during the third quarter of sales we generate revenue from the sale of gas delivery systems and other subassemblies 
for the year ended december  sales increased  or million to million from million for the year ended december  an increase in end user demand for semiconductors during resulted in increased demand in the semiconductor capital equipment industry and therefore increased demand for our gas delivery systems 
in addition  we began shipping frame assemblies in the second quarter of and top plate assemblies in the fourth quarter of these new product shipments contributed million to revenue in the semiconductor capital equipment industry is highly concentrated and we are therefore highly dependent upon a small number of customers 
applied materials  lam research and novellus are our three largest customers and each has greater than of our total sales 
as a percentage of total revenue  sales to our three largest customers were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
gross profit cost of goods sold consists primarily of purchased materials  labor and overhead  including depreciation  associated with the design and manufacture of products sold 
gross profit for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million 
gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in gross profit from the year ended december  was primarily attributable to sharply higher sales and production of gas delivery systems 
in addition  the increased production resulted in significantly higher factory utilization and therefore we were able to absorb more fixed costs and costs of operations  resulting in higher gross profit as a percentage of sales 
we also implemented several cost containment measures during the second half of  including work force reductions and mandatory time off 
research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of activities related to new component testing and evaluation  test equipment and fixture development  product design  and other product development activities 
research and development expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million 
the increase in spending was due to an increase in engineering activity associated with new product design  test equipment and other product development activities including a new product design and customer specific design modifications for our next generation catalytic steam generator 
as a percentage of sales  however  research and development expense decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  this decrease in research and development expense as a percentage of sales was attributable to the steep increase in total net sales 
sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and commissions paid to our sales and service employees  salaries paid to our engineers who work with our sales and service employees to help determine the components and configuration requirements for new products and other costs related to the sales of our 
table of contents products 
sales and marketing expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million 
this increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily attributable to approximately million in additional compensation paid to our sales and service employees due to the higher revenue generated  and the balance of the increase was due to increased travel expense  approximately million in costs associated with evaluation units and product samples  and increased sales activities by our engineers 
sales and marketing expense as a percentage of sales decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  due to the significantly higher sales in compared to general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and overhead of our administrative staff  and professional fees 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  we experienced higher general and administrative expense in  primarily due to approximately million in costs attributable to the addition of new administrative employees as a result of our significantly higher levels of manufacturing activity  approximately million in costs related to legal  accounting  consulting  insurance and other fees associated with our becoming a public company  and approximately million for costs associated with the startup activities of our new facility in shanghai  china 
also included in general and administrative expense in was million for costs associated with our consideration of an acquisition that we decided not to pursue during the third quarter 
during we expect general and administrative expense to be slightly higher than due to public company costs running over four quarters compared to three quarters in and due to additional expenses for sarbanes oxley certification 
stock and other deferred compensation stock and other deferred compensation expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million in this increase was primarily attributable to the vesting of our series a senior notes following our initial public offering 
we expect the adoption of sfas r in the second half of to materially increase stock compensation expense 
interest expense  net interest expense for the year ended december  reduced to million from million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
this decrease in interest expense was attributable to the extinguishment of our series a senior notes issued in the fourth quarter of in connection with the ultra clean acquisition 
this extinguishment of debt occurred after our initial public offering in the first quarter of provision for income taxes provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in taxable income for the year ended december  the effective tax rate for was compared to in the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was slightly less than the statutory rate of primarily as a result of a tax benefit from exempt income which was almost entirely offset by foreign operations  state income taxes and non deductible expenses 
for the year ended december   the effective tax rate was higher than the statutory rate due to the mix of state taxable income and losses in texas combined with a consolidated net income of approximately breakeven 

table of contents year ended december  compared with year ended december  sales sales for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
this decrease in sales was due to the continued downturn in the semiconductor capital equipment industry during the first three quarters of  which resulted in decreased demand and sales of our gas delivery systems 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in gross profit for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to sharply higher sales of gas delivery systems in the fourth quarter  during which time we were able to increase production without substantially increasing the number of employees 
we recorded an immaterial charge for excess and obsolete inventory for the year ended december   compared to a charge of million for the year ended december  we implemented several cost containment measures during the fourth quarter of and the first three quarters of  including workforce reductions and mandatory time off 
research and development expense research and development expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
research and development expense as a percentage of sales increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  this increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable to the development of additional test fixtures for a wider range of products and to additional design activity required by two of our major customers 
sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
sales and marketing expense as a percentage of sales increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  this increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily attributable to our expansion into new product lines at one of our major customers 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  we experienced higher general and administrative expense in  primarily due to costs of million associated with the ultra clean acquisition 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december  included million in professional fees paid to third party financial advisors for services they performed for us  approximately million in bonus accrual associated with our management bonus and profit sharing plans and approximately million associated with deferred compensation amortization resulting from restricted stock and employee debt which originated at the time of the ultra clean acquisition 
in process research and development expense in process research and development expense for the year ended december  was million  resulting from one project related to the development of technology and a related product that simplified the generation of steam for use in the semiconductor manufacturing process the catalytic steam generator 
our 
table of contents development efforts were completed in december actual costs incurred to complete this project were not significantly different from the initial estimate 
value ascribed to the project was based on the cost method and represented the cost of personnel  material  equipment and finance charges that would have been incurred to replicate the project to its development stage at the date of acquisition 
we had no in process research and development expenses for the year ended december  interest expense  net interest expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
this increase in interest expense was attributable to interest payable on our series a senior notes held by fp ultra clean  llc and some of our key employees which were issued in the fourth quarter of in connection with the ultra clean acquisition 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million compared to million income tax benefit for the year ended december  this increase in provision for income taxes was primarily attributable to the increase in taxable income for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the state tax rate was higher than the statutory rate due the mix of taxable income and losses in texas combined with a consolidated net income approximating break even

fiscal quarter first second third fourth fiscal year in thousands sales gross margin net income sales gross margin net income loss our sales increased sharply during the first half of sequential quarterly growth was and for the first and second quarters ended march and june   respectively 
however  in the middle of the third quarter ended september   there was a decline in demand for our products by most of our customers 
this resulted in a sequential quarterly reduction in sales of million  or in the third quarter of compared to the second quarter ended june  furthermore  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  net sales declined to million which was a sequential decline of million or from the third quarter of these revenue reductions were due to a general softening in demand throughout the semiconductor capital equipment industry which is likely to continue into at least the first half of as a result of the lower sales in the second half of  our gross profit decreased by million or in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter of and decreased million or in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter of these reductions in gross margin were due primarily to lower sales and manufacturing volumes 
through cost reduction actions  including reducing our workforce by and a portion of our workforce taking mandatory time off  our gross margin of for the third quarter of 
table of contents was equal to the gross margin for the second quarter of and our gross margin in the fourth quarter of declined only moderately from the third quarter of to 
notwithstanding the volatility in sales during  we remained profitable in each of the four quarterly periods 
net profit after tax as a percentage of revenue was   and during the four quarterly periods of  respectively 
our sales sharply increased during the fourth quarter of  as compared to each of the first three quarters of  as a result of significant growth in the semiconductor industry 
in order to support this increased demand  we added a significant number of manufacturing personnel and additional test equipment in the fourth quarter of liquidity and capital resources historically  we have required capital principally to fund our working capital needs  satisfy our debt obligations  maintain our equipment and purchase new capital equipment 
as of december   we had cash of million as compared to million as of december  for the year ended december   we generated cash from operating activities of million  primarily attributable to generating net income before depreciation and amortization of million 
this increase was partially offset by funding increases in accounts receivable  inventory and prepaid expenses and other 
we increased inventories to support our increased sales activities in  which also resulted in increased payables 
for the year ended december   we generated cash from operating activities of million  primarily attributable to net income from operations and carrying a higher level of payables compared with the year ended december  these increases were offset by funding increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was million  primarily for the purchase of equipment  leasehold improvements and computers  of which  investment in our clean room and other facilities at our shanghai  china facility accounted for million 
for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was million and consisted  primarily  of the purchase of computer hardware and an engineering software application 
for the year ended december  we generated cash from financing activities of million 
net cash proceeds from our march  initial public offering were million after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses  including a million advisory fee paid to francisco partners 
we used the net proceeds from the offering to redeem million of our series a senior notes held by fp ultra clean  llc and million held by some of our key employees  plus accrued interest 
as of december   all of our series a senior notes had been redeemed 
for the year ended december   we used cash in financing activities of million for principal payments on our capital lease obligations 
we anticipate that our operating cash flow  together with available borrowings under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements  capital lease obligations  expansion plans and technology development projects for at least the next twelve months 
the adequacy of these resources to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth  the cyclical expansion or contraction of the semiconductor capital equipment industry and capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our products 
revolving credit facility ultra clean technology systems and service  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  entered into a revolving credit facility with union bank of california in july providing for borrowings of up to million based upon a defined borrowing base 
we never utilized the revolving credit facility in or on september  this credit facility expired 

table of contents on november   we entered into a new revolving loan and security agreement providing for loans of up to million with a million sub limit for letters of credit with the union bank of california 
the loans bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to per annum plus libor or the reference rate established from time to time by union bank 
interest on the loans is payable monthly  and the revolving facility matures on june  at any time prior to the revolving maturity date  we may elect to convert up to million of outstanding revolving borrowings into a three year term loan with quarterly payments of principal and interest 
the term loan will bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to per annum plus libor or plus the reference rate 
obligations under the agreement are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets and are guaranteed by our domestic subsidiaries and substantially all of their assets 
there were no amounts outstanding under this line of credit at december  in february we utilized million of the million sub limits for letters of credit in our credit facility with union bank to guarantee a working capital loan with a local chinese bank for our shanghai subsidiary 
capital expenditures we spent million on capital expenditures for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  we anticipate that our requirements for additional capital expenditures in will be approximately million but our requirements are subject to change depending upon industry conditions 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of december   in thousands for the year ended december  total purchase obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total operating lease expense reflects the fact that the lease for our headquarters facility in menlo park  california expires on july  with a minimum nine month month to month option at expiration see properties above and the lease for our manufacturing facilities in austin  texas expire on august  and september  we expect to renew our menlo park lease prior to expiration or lease other facilities

as a result  we have no indebtedness for borrowed money 
therefore  our exposure to market risk related to interest rates is limited 
if and when we enter into future borrowing arrangements or borrow under our existing revolving credit facility  we may seek to manage exposure to interest rate changes by using a mix of debt maturities and variable and fixed rate debt  together with interest rate swaps where appropriate  to fix or lower our borrowing costs 
we do not make material sales outside the united states or have material purchase obligations outside of the united states with the exception of china 
furthermore  the chinese currency fluctuates in direct proportion to the united states dollar 
therefore  we do not generally have exposure to foreign currency exchange risks
