item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of actual events and or future results of operations may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements  as a result of the factors described here  and in the documents incorporated herein by reference  including  those factors described under factors that may affect future results and market price of stock 
overview we are a leading provider of outsource sales and marketing programs for service contracts for technology companies  which represents almost of our revenues 
our cost effective programs generate service revenue and promote customer retention for our clients 
core services include professional telesales  direct marketing  hosted ecommerce and order management  including invoicing and collecting from our clients customers 
additional services include customer database hosting and enhancement  technology integration with client systems 
our services to technology clients are designed to increase the revenue from their support contracts and to enhance their customer relationships 
these services are available individually or  more typically  as an integrated solution 
our business primarily consists of marketing and selling our clients products and services to their business customers 
we provide our services primarily under pay for performance arrangements in which our revenue is based on our ability to sell our clients products and services to their customers 
accordingly  if a particular client s products and services fail to appeal to its customers for reasons beyond our control  such as preference for a competing product or service  our revenue from the sale of the client s products and services may decline 
our clients can also purchase complementary services  such as additional database management and supplementary marketing programs  on a fee basis 
new clients may require us to make significant up front investments  including hiring additional staff and creating the necessary infrastructure to deliver our services 
these costs are typically incurred some time before significant revenue is generated 
we may charge for certain of these costs  however  these costs could have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and operating results  depending on market acceptance of new service combinations and pricing options 
the majority of our revenues are derived from marketing and selling our client s service contracts 
because of this  our quarterly and annual revenues may fluctuate based on the total service contracts available for renewal or conversion in that period 
as a result of this as well as general conditions in the united states  our net revenue has declined in the past and may do so again 
if the economic conditions in the united states worsen or if a wider or global economic slowdown occurs  we may experience a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
during unfavorable economic periods  it may be more difficult to sign new clients or expand relationships with existing clients 
in addition  during unfavorable economic periods  spending on existing and new technology may decrease  resulting in downgrades of service contracts or fewer new service contracts  which may have a material adverse impact on our business 
this impact may be offset as technology companies may compensate for decreased spending on new technology and technology upgrades with expanded service contracts on their existing technology 
our quarterly and annual operating results may continue to fluctuate in the future based on a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
we believe that period to period comparisons of operating results should not be relied upon as predictive of future performance 
our operating results are expected to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict 
our historical revenue has tended to fluctuate based on seasonal buying patterns of our clients and their customers 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by technology companies  particularly given that we operate in new and rapidly evolving markets  and face an uncertain economic environment 
we may not be successful in addressing such risks and difficulties 
see factors that may affect future results and market price of stock 

table of contents critical accounting policies estimates our significant accounting polices are described in note of notes to financial statements 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are critical  either because they relate to financial statement line items that are key indicators of our financial performance eg  revenue and or because their application requires significant management judgment  are described in the following paragraphs 
management has discussed the development of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and they have reviewed the disclosures of such policies and management s estimates in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
use of estimates the preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to establish accounting policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  investments  commissions and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes include revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  and impairment of long lived assets 
we have other equally important accounting policies and practices  however  once adopted  these other policies either generally do not require us to make significant estimates or assumptions or otherwise only require implementation of the adopted policy not a judgment as to the application of policy itself 
despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and assumptions  actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition and financial statement presentations during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reevaluated our application of emerging issues task force no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf  to the presentation of our revenues generated from the sale of our client s products and services 
based on our evaluation  we have changed the manner in which we report revenues earned from certain client contracts in the statement of operations to the net basis 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we reported such revenues on a gross basis 
in order to provide consistency in all periods presented  revenues and costs of revenues for all prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
such reclassifications had no effect on previously reported results of operations  total assets or accumulated deficit 
the effect of such reclassification on the company s net revenue for the years ended december  and are as follows in thousands years ended december  net revenue  as previously reported impact of reclassification to reflect net revenue presentation net revenue  as reclassified 
table of contents revenue from the sale of service contracts and maintenance renewals is recognized when a purchase order from the client s customer is received  the service contract or maintenance agreement is delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  the collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  and no significant post delivery obligations remain unfulfilled 
revenue from product sales is recognized at the time of shipment of the product directly to the client s customer 
revenue from services we perform is recognized as the services are accepted 
revenue from fee based activities is recognized once these services have been delivered 
our revenue recognition policy involves significant judgments and estimates about collectibility 
we assess the probability of collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history and or the creditworthiness of our clients customers  which is based on current published credit ratings  current events and circumstances regarding the business of our client s customer and other factors that we believe are relevant 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we defer revenue recognition until such time as collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash payment 
in the fourth quarter of  we also reclassified our direct costs associated with promoting and selling our clients products and services from sales and marketing expense to costs of services 
sales and marketing expenses now primarily represent our corporate sales and marketing efforts to secure new clients 
this change in presentation has been made for all financial periods presented herein 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients customers to make required payments of amounts due to us 
the allowance is comprised of specifically identified account balances for which collection is currently deemed doubtful 
in addition to specifically identified accounts  estimates of amounts that may not be collectible from those accounts whose collection is not yet deemed doubtful but which may become doubtful in the future are made based on historical bad debt write off experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  and was  and  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets we review all of our long lived assets  consisting principally of fixed assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and a significant change in our market capitalization relative to our net book value 
an asset or a group of assets is determined to be impaired if the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets are less than their carrying value 
if impairment exists  it is measured as the difference between the carrying value of the asset or group of assets and their estimated fair values 
fair values are determined using third party valuations  discounted cash flow analyses or other generally accepted methods 
estimating future cash flows attributable to a particular asset or group of assets is difficult  and requires the use of significant judgment 
significant concentrations we generated a significant portion of our net revenues from the marketing and selling of products and services for a limited number of clients 
in  and  sales to customers of dell  hp  nortel and sybase each accounted for more than of our net revenues 
in   and  sales to customers of the previously mentioned clients collectively accounted for   and  respectively  of net revenues and the largest individual client accounted for   and of our net revenues in   and  
table of contents respectively 
with the acquisition of sunset direct  we expect the percentage of net revenue generated from our largest customers to decrease from over to approximately in we have outsource services agreements with our clients that expire at various dates ranging from july through april many of our client agreements contain automatic renewal clauses 
these clients may  however  terminate their contracts for cause in accordance with the provisions of each contract 
in most cases  a client must provide us with advance written notice of its intention to terminate 
the termination or non renewal of outsource agreements with any one of our significant clients could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we expect that a small number of clients will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenue 
in addition  our technology clients operate in industries that are experiencing consolidation  which may reduce the number of our existing and potential clients

the timing of payments to this client were changed from our standard day terms to a staggered payment schedule 
sales for the first month of a quarter are now required to be paid in the third month of that current quarter and sales for the second and third month of that quarter are remitted in the first month of the following quarter

we anticipate that our existing capital resources  cash flow expected to be generated from future operations  including the newly acquired sunset direct operations  and availability of external equity and debt financing sources will enable us to maintain our current level of operations  our planned operations and our planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
however  if we do not achieve our plans we may need to raise additional cash to fund operations 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements for the funding of operations  material non recurring capital expenditures and potential acquisitions through a combination of cash flow expected to be generated by operations  long term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of additional equity securities by us 
off balance sheet arrangements leases as of december   our off balance sheet arrangements include operating leases for our facility and certain property and equipment that expire at various dates through these arrangements allow us to obtain the use of the equipment and facilities without purchasing them 
if we were to acquire these assets  we would be required to obtain financing and record a liability related to the financing of these assets 
leasing these assets under operating leases allows us to use these assets for our business while minimizing the obligations and up front cash flow related to purchasing the assets 
during  we recorded rent expense related to these leases of  rent expense in will increase as a result of the acquisition of sunset direct

these obligations primarily relate to certain agreements with our officers  directors and employees  under which we may be required to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out of their employment relationship 
the terms of such obligations vary 
generally  a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated 
because the obligated amounts of these types of agreements often are not explicitly stated  the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated 
historically  we have not been obligated to make any payments for these obligations  and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on our balance sheets as of december  contractual obligations capital leases we lease certain property under capital leases that expire at various dates through the effective annual interest rates on our capital lease obligations range from to  with an average of

fin r requires disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate  but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the consolidation requirements apply to existing entities in the first reporting period that ends after march  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our results of consolidated operations or financial position 
in december  the staff of the sec issued sab  revenue recognition  which supersedes sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab s primary purpose is to rescind the accounting guidance contained in the sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements that was superseded as a result of the issuance of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
additionally  sab rescinds the sec s related revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers issued with sab that had been codified in sec topic  revenue recognition

the ajca introduces a special tax deduction on qualified production activities 
fas clarifies that this tax deduction should be accounted for as a special tax deduction in accordance with statement pursuant to the ajca  the company will not be able to claim this tax benefit until the first quarter of fiscal we do not expect the adoption of these new tax provisions to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows

 accounting for stock based compensation and generally requires the cost associated with employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments be measured based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognized in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services in exchange for the award 
sfas no

sfas no 
r is effective for the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period after june  the quarter ended september  for the company and applies to all outstanding and unvested share based payment awards at a company s adoption date 
we expect that the adoption of this standard will increase our net loss and loss per share  however it will have no impact on cash flow 
although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas  we are evaluating the requirements under sfas r including the valuation methods and support for the assumptions that underlie the valuation of the awards and the transition methods modified prospective transition method or the modified retrospective transition method

sfas eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
this statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges in fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
factors that may affect future results and market price of stock we have incurred recent losses and may incur losses in the future 
we incurred an operating loss of million and net loss of million for  an operating loss of and net loss of million for  and an operating loss of million and a net loss of million for we may incur losses in the future  depending on the timing of signing of new clients  costs to initiate service for new clients  impact of new and existing clients  our decisions to further invest in our technology or infrastructure  and our ability to continue to increase our operating efficiencies 
we may need to raise additional capital which might not be available or which  if available  could be on terms adverse to our common stockholders 
we expect that our current cash and cash equivalent balances will be adequate to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least twelve months 
after that  we may need to raise additional funds  and we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  if at all 
we may also require additional capital for the acquisition of businesses  products and technologies that are complementary to ours 
further  if we issue equity securities to raise capital  the ownership percentage of our stockholders would be reduced  and the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those existing holders of our common stock 
if we cannot raise needed funds on acceptable terms  we may not be able to take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  which could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
because we depend on a small number of clients for a significant portion of our revenue  the loss of a single client could result in a substantial decrease in our revenue 
we have generated a significant portion of our revenue from sales to customers of a limited number of clients 
in  and  sales to customers of dell  hp  nortel and sybase each accounted for more than of our net revenues 
for   and  sales to customers of the previously mentioned clients collectively accounted for   and  respectively  of net revenues 
no individual client accounted for more than   and of our net revenues in   and  respectively 
we expect that a small number of clients will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenue for the foreseeable future 
the loss of any of our principal clients could cause a significant decrease in our net revenue 
in addition  our software and technology clients operate in industries that experience consolidation from time to time  which could reduce the number of our existing and potential clients 
any loss of a single significant client may have a material adverse effect on our financial position  cash flows and results of operations 
our revenue will decline if demand for our clients products and services decreases 
our business primarily consists of marketing and selling our clients products and services to their customers 
in addition  most of our revenue is based on a pay for performance model in which our revenues are based on the amount of our clients products and services that we sell 
accordingly  if a particular client s 
table of contents products and services fail to appeal to its customers for reasons beyond our control  such as preference for a competing product or service  our revenue from the sale of the client s products and services may decline 
we are exposed to general economic conditions 
as a result of recent unfavorable economic conditions in the united states  our revenue has and may continue to decline 
if the economic conditions in the united states worsen or if a wider or global economic slowdown occurs  we may experience a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
during these unfavorable economic periods  it may be more difficult to sign new clients or expand relationships with existing clients 
we are exposed to increased costs and risks associated with complying with increasing and new regulations of corporate governance and disclosure standards 
we are spending an increased amount of management time and internal and external resources to comply with changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq stock market rules 
in particular  section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires management s annual review and evaluation of our internal control systems and attestations of the effectiveness of these systems by our independent auditors 
we are currently documenting and testing our internal control systems and procedures and considering improvements that may be necessary in order for us to comply with the requirements of section by the end of this process has required us to hire outside advisory services and has resulted in additional accounting and legal expenses 
in addition  the evaluation and attestation processes required by section are new and neither companies nor auditing firms have significant experience in testing or complying with these requirements 
accordingly  we may encounter problems or delays in completing the review and evaluation  the implementation of improvements and the receipt of a positive attestation by our independent auditors 
while we believe that we currently have adequate internal controls over financial reporting  in the event that our chief executive officer  chief financial officer or independent auditors determine that our controls over financial reporting are not effective as defined under section  investor perceptions of our company may be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock 
terrorist acts and acts of war may harm our business and revenue  costs and expenses  and financial position 
terrorist acts or acts of war my cause damage to our employees  facilities  clients  our clients customers  and vendors  which could significantly impact our revenues  costs and expenses and financial position 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks or perceived threats to national security  and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties that could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot be presently predicted 
we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate  and if we do not meet market expectations  our stock price could decline 
we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of future performance 
although our operating results have generally improved from quarter to quarter until recently  our future operating results may not follow past trends in every quarter  even if they continue to improve overall 
in any future quarter  our operating results may be below the expectation of public market analysts and investors 
factors which may cause our future operating results to be below expectations include the growth of the market for outsourced sales and marketing solutions  the demand for and acceptance of our services  
table of contents the demand for our clients products and services  the length of the sales and integration cycle for our new clients  our ability to expand relationships with existing clients  our ability to develop and implement additional services  products and technologies  the success of our direct sales force  our ability to retain existing clients  and our ability to integrate acquisitions including our recent acquisition of sunset direct 
the length and unpredictability of the sales and integration cycles for our full solution service offering could cause delays in our revenue growth 
selection of our services often entails an extended decision making process on the part of prospective clients 
we often must provide a significant level of education regarding the use and benefit of our services  which may delay the evaluation and acceptance process 
the selling cycle can extend to approximately nine to twelve months or longer between initial client contact and signing of a contract for our services 
additionally  once our services are selected  the integration of our services often can be a lengthy process  which further impacts the timing of revenue since revenues are not earned until we sell our client s services to customers 
because we are unable to control many of the factors that will influence our clients buying decisions or the integration of our services  the length and unpredictability of the sales and integration cycles make it difficult for us to forecast the growth and timing of our revenue 
if we are unable to attract and retain highly qualified management  sales and technical personnel  the quality of our services may decline  and our ability to execute our growth strategies may be harmed 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the contributions of our executive officers and key sales and technical personnel and our ability to attract and retain highly qualified sales  technical and managerial personnel 
competition for personnel is intense as these personnel are limited in supply 
we have at times experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel  and there can be no assurance that we will not experience difficulties in the future 
any difficulties could limit our future growth 
the loss of certain key personnel  particularly michael silton  our chief executive officer  and steve valenzuela  our chief financial officer  could seriously harm our business 
we have obtained a life insurance policy in the amount of million on michael silton 
we have strong competitors and may not be able to compete effectively against them 
competition in crm services is intense  and we expect such competition to increase in the future 
our competitors include system integrators  ecommerce solutions providers  and other outsource providers of different components of customer interaction management 
we also face competition from internal marketing departments of current and potential clients 
additionally  we may face competition from outsource providers with substantial offshore facilities which may enable them to compete aggressively with similar service offerings at a substantially lower price 
many of our existing or potential competitors have greater name recognition  longer operating histories  and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources  which could further impact our ability to address competitive pressures 
should competitive factors require us to increase spending for  and investment in  client acquisition and retention or for the development of new services  our expenses could increase disproportionately to our revenues 
competitive pressures may also necessitate price reductions and other actions that would likely affect our business adversely 
additionally  there can be no assurances that we will have the resources to maintain a higher level of spending to address changes in the competitive landscape 
failure to maintain or to produce revenue proportionate to any increase in expenses would have a negative impact on our financial results 

table of contents the demand for outsourced sales and marketing services is highly uncertain 
demand and acceptance of our sales and marketing services is dependent upon companies willingness to outsource these processes 
it is possible that these outsourced solutions may never achieve broad market acceptance 
if the market for our services does not grow or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate  our business  financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected 
our success depends on our ability to successfully manage growth 
any future growth will place additional demands on our managerial  administrative  operational and financial resources 
we will need to improve our operational  financial and managerial controls and information systems and procedures and will need to train and manage our overall work force 
if we are unable to manage additional growth effectively  our business will be harmed 
our business strategy may ultimately include expansion into foreign markets  which would require increased expenditures  and if our international operations are not successfully implemented  they may not result in increased revenue or growth of our business 
our long term growth strategy may include expansion into international markets 
as a result  we may need to establish international operations  hire additional personnel and establish relationships with additional clients and customers in those markets 
this expansion may require significant financial resources and management attention and could have a negative effect on our earnings 
in addition  we may be exposed to political risks associated with operating in foreign markets 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in creating international demand for our crm services or that we will be able to effectively sell our clients products and services in international markets 
any business combinations in which we participate could result in dilution  unfavorable accounting charges and difficulties in successfully managing our business 
as part of our business strategy  we review from time to time business combination prospects that would complement our existing business or enhance our technological capabilities 
future business combinations by us  such as the acquisition of sunset direct  could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  large and immediate write offs  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could cause our financial performance to suffer 
furthermore  business combinations entail numerous risks and uncertainties  including difficulties in the assimilation of operations  personnel  technologies  products and the information systems of the combined companies  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
we cannot be certain that we would be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that might be acquired in the future  and our failure to do so could limit our future growth 
although we do not currently have any agreement with respect to any additional material business combinations  we may enter into business combinations with complementary businesses  products or technologies in the future 
however  we may not be able to locate suitable business combination opportunities 

table of contents we rely heavily on our communications infrastructure  and the failure to invest in or the loss of these systems could disrupt the operation and growth of our business and result in the loss of clients or our clients customers 
our success is dependent in large part on our continued investment in sophisticated computer  internet and telecommunications systems 
we have invested significantly in technology and anticipate that it will be necessary to continue to do so in the future to remain competitive 
these technologies are evolving rapidly and are characterized by short product life cycles  which require us to anticipate technological developments 
we may be unsuccessful in anticipating  managing  adopting and integrating technological changes on a timely basis  or we may not have the capital resources available to invest in new technologies 
temporary or permanent loss of these systems could limit our ability to conduct our business and result in lost revenue 
if we are unable to safeguard our networks and clients data  our clients may not use our services and our business may be harmed 
our networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer hacking  computer viruses and other security problems 
a user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations 
we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breaches 
although we intend to continue to implement industry standard security measures  these measures may be inadequate 
damage to our facilities may disrupt our operations 
we have taken precautions to protect ourselves from events that could interrupt our services  such as off site storage of computer backup data and a backup power source  but there can be no assurance that an earthquake  fire  flood or other disaster affecting any of our facilities would not disable these operations 
in february  we acquired sunset direct that has its primary facility located in austin  texas 
we believe our combined operational facilities would minimize disruptions to the operations of the company in the event of a business interruption in any one of our facilities on a short term basis 
in the event of the loss of a facility in either scotts valley or austin  our business would be impacted until such time as we were able to transfer operations to the sister facility 
while we maintain insurance coverage for business interruptions  such coverage does not extend to losses caused by earthquake and such coverage may not be sufficient to cover all possible losses 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property or face a claim of intellectual property infringement by a third party  we may lose our intellectual property rights and be liable for significant damages 
we cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property 
in addition  we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property and take appropriate steps to enforce our rights 
if third parties infringe or misappropriate our trade secrets  copyrights  trademarks  service marks  trade names or other proprietary information  our business could be seriously harmed 
in addition  although we believe that our proprietary rights do not infringe the intellectual property rights of others  other parties may assert infringement claims against us that we violated their intellectual property rights 
these claims  even if not true  could result in significant legal and other costs and may be a distraction to management 
in addition  protection of intellectual property in many foreign countries is weaker and less reliable than in the united states  so if our business expands into foreign countries  risks associated with protecting our intellectual property will increase

increased government regulation of the internet could decrease the demand for our services and increase our cost of doing business 
the increasing popularity and use of the internet and online services may lead to the adoption of new laws and regulations in the us or elsewhere covering issues such as online privacy  copyright and trademark  sales taxes and fair business practices or which require qualification to do business as a foreign corporation in certain jurisdictions 
increased government regulation  or the application of existing laws to online activities  could inhibit internet growth 
a number of government authorities are increasingly focusing on online privacy issues and the use of personal information 
our business could be adversely affected if new regulations regarding the use of personal information are introduced or if government authorities choose to investigate our privacy practices 
in addition  the european union has adopted directives addressing data privacy that may limit the collection and use of some information regarding internet users 
such directives may limit our ability to target our clients customers or collect and use information 
a decline in the growth of the internet could decrease demand for our services and increase our cost of doing business and otherwise harm our business 
we are subject to government regulation of direct marketing  which could restrict the operation and growth of our business 
the federal trade commission s ftc s telemarketing sales rules prohibit misrepresentations of the cost  terms  restrictions  performance or duration of products or services offered by telephone solicitation and specifically addresses other perceived telemarketing abuses in the offering of prizes 
additionally  the ftc s rules limit the hours during which telemarketers may call consumers 
the federal telephone consumer protection act of contains other restrictions on facsimile transmissions and on telemarketers  including a prohibition on the use of automated telephone dialing equipment to call certain telephone numbers 
a number of states also regulate telemarketing and some states have enacted restrictions similar to these federal laws 
in addition  a number of states regulate email and facsimile transmissions 
the failure to comply with applicable statutes and regulations could result in penalties 
there can be no assurance that additional federal or state legislation  or changes in regulatory implementation  or judicial interpretation of existing or future laws would not limit our activities in the future or significantly increase the cost of regulatory compliance 
our directors and their affiliates own a large percentage of our stock and can significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval 
our directors  executive officers and entities affiliated with them together beneficially control approximately of our outstanding shares based on the number of shares outstanding as of february  
as a result  any significant combination of those stockholders  acting together  will have the ability to control all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of all directors  and any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
accordingly  such concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of rainmaker  which  in turn  could depress the market price of our common stock 
our charter documents and delaware law contain anti takeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts  even if a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders 
the provisions of delaware law and of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us  even though an acquisition might be beneficial to our stockholders 
our certificate of incorporation provides our board of directors the authority  without stockholder action  to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series 
our board determines when we will issue preferred stock  and the rights  preferences and privileges of any preferred stock 
in addition  our bylaws establish an advance notice 
table of contents procedure for stockholder proposals and for nominating candidates for election as directors 
delaware corporate law also contains provisions that can affect the ability to take over a company 
our stock price may be volatile resulting in potential litigation 
if our stock price is volatile  we could face securities class action litigation 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of their stock  many companies have been the subjects of securities class action litigation 
if we were sued in a securities class action  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources and could cause our stock price to fall 
the trading price of our common stock could fluctuate widely due to quarter to quarter variations in results of operations  loss of a major client  announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors  changes in  or our failure to meet  the expectations of securities analysts  new products or services offered by us or our competitors  changes in market valuations of similar companies  announcements of strategic relationships or acquisitions by us or our competitors  other events or factors that may be beyond our control  or if we raise additional cash  this would likely be highly dilutive to investors and our stock price may decline 
in addition  the securities markets in general have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility in the past 
the trading prices of securities of many business process outsourcing companies have fluctuated broadly  often for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these general market and industry factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of that became law in july has required us to make changes in some of our corporate governance and securities disclosure or compliance practices 
that act also requires the sec to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects  in addition to rule proposals already made  and nasdaq has also issued revisions to its requirements for companies that are nasdaq listed 
these developments have increased our legal and accounting compliance costs and will likely continue to do so in the future 
these developments have also made it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage in the future 
these developments could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  or qualified executive officers 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result 
we may have difficulty obtaining director and officer liability insurance in acceptable amounts for acceptable rates 
like most other public companies  we carry insurance protecting our officers and directors and us against claims relating to the conduct of our business 
this insurance covers  among other things  the costs incurred by companies and their management to defend against and resolve claims relating to management conduct and results of operations  such as securities class action claims 
these claims typically are extremely expensive to defend against and resolve 
hence  as is customary  we purchase and maintain insurance to cover some of these costs 
we pay significant premiums to acquire and maintain this insurance  which is provided by third party 
table of contents insurers 
since  the premiums we have paid for this insurance have increased substantially 
one consequence of the current economic downturn and decline in stock prices has been a substantial general increase in the number of securities class actions and similar claims brought against public corporations and their management  including our company and certain of our current and former officers and directors 
many  if not all  of these actions and claims are  and will likely continue to be  at least partially insured by third party insurers 
consequently  insurers providing director and officer liability insurance have in recent periods sharply increased the premiums they charge for this insurance  raised retentions that is  the amount of liability that a company is required to itself pay to defend and resolve a claim before any applicable insurance is provided  and limited the amount of insurance they will provide 
moreover  insurers typically provide only one year policies 
we renewed our director and officer insurance in the fourth quarter of for a one year term 
in the fourth quarter of  we will be required to do the same 
particularly in the current economic environment  we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain sufficient director and officer liability insurance coverage at acceptable rates and with acceptable deductibles and other limitations 
failure to obtain such insurance could materially harm our financial condition in the event that we are required to defend against and resolve any future securities class actions or other claims made against the company or our management 
further  the inability to obtain such insurance in adequate amounts may impair our future ability to retain and recruit qualified officers and directors 
our business may be subject to additional obligations to collect and remit sales tax and  any successful action by state authorities to collect additional sales tax could adversely harm our business 
we file sales tax returns in certain states within the united states as required by law and certain client contracts for a portion of the outsourced sales and marketing services that we provide 
we do not collect sales or other similar taxes in other states and many of the states do not apply sales or similar taxes to the vast majority of the services that we provide 
however  one or more states could seek to impose additional sales or use tax collection and record keeping obligations on us 
any successful action by state authorities to compel us to collect and remit sales tax  either retroactively  prospectively or both  could adversely affect our results of operations and business 
if we fail to meet the nasdaq smallcap market listing requirements  our common stock will be delisted 
our common stock is currently listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
nasdaq has requirements that a company must meet in order to remain listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
if we continue to experience losses from our operations  or are unable to raise additional funds or our stock price does not meet minimum standards  we may not be able to maintain the standards for continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market  which include  among other things  that our stock maintain a minimum closing bid price of at least per share subject to applicable grace and cure periods 
if as a result of the application of such listing requirements our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market  our stock would become harder to buy and sell 
consequently  if we were removed from the nasdaq smallcap market  the ability or willingness of broker dealers to sell or make a market in our common stock might decline 
as a result  the ability to resell shares of our common stock could be adversely affected 
as we reported on our current report on form k filed on march   we received a deficiency notice from nasdaq on march   indicating that our stock failed to close above for consecutive trading days  making us subject to delisting from nasdaq for this deficiency at the conclusion of a day grace period which expires on september   unless we are able to cure such deficiency before such time or are then eligible for an additional day grace period under nasdaq s marketplace rules 
shares eligible for sale in the future could negatively affect our stock price 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock or the perception that these sales could occur 
this might also make it more difficult for us to raise funds through the issuance of securities 
as of february   we had outstanding  shares of common stock 
as of february   there were an aggregate of  shares of common stock issuable 
table of contents upon exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants  including  shares issuable upon exercise of options outstanding under our option plan and  shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the outstanding warrants issued to the selling security holders in our private placement transaction completed on february  under our existing stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan  we may issue up to an additional  shares and  shares of our common stock  respectively  subject to the terms and conditions of such plans 
we may issue and or register additional shares  options  or warrants in the future in connection with acquisitions  compensation or otherwise 
we have not entered into any agreements or understanding regarding any future acquisitions and cannot ensure that we will be able to identify or complete any acquisition in the future 
in connection with the acquisition of sunset direct on february   the company has agreed to file  on a commercially reasonable efforts basis  a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission with respect to the shares that were issued to sunset direct s shareholders pursuant to the merger transaction by which we acquired sunset direct 
after the registration statement becomes effective  approximately  of such shares will be available for public sale  with an additional  of such shares available for sale six months from closing   of such shares available for sale nine months from closing and  of such shares available for sale twelve months from closing 
approximately  shares of common stock consideration have been placed in escrow and will not be released until twelve months after closing  subject to potential post closing adjustments 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio 
we currently do not and do not plan to use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we plan to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and investment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in low risk securities 
to minimize our risks  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of short term and liquid securities including money market funds  commercial paper  us government and agency securities and municipal bonds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   of our portfolio was invested in instruments that mature in less than days 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio at december   we do not believe we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
at december   the interest rates on all of our outstanding capital leases and debt are fixed and therefore not subject to interest rate fluctuations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements
