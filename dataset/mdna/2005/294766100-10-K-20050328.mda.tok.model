item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview equus ii incorporated is a business development company which invests in equity and equity oriented securities issued by privately owned companies in transactions negotiated directly with such companies 
we had investments in sixteen entities  including twelve portfolio companies  two venture capital funds and two entities which have disposed of substantially all of their assets and are awaiting liquidation at december  at december   we had investments in eighteen entities  including fifteen portfolio companies  two venture funds and one entity awaiting liquidation 
we did not make any new investments in the twelve months ended december  or we attempt to limit risk by investing in a portfolio of companies involved in different industries 
we limit our initial investment in any company to no more than of the fund s net assets 
however  at december   of our net assets were invested in one portfolio company in the residential window industry 
the valuation of our investments is the most significant area of judgment impacting our financial statements 
our portfolio investments are valued at our estimates of fair value  with the net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation included in the determination of net assets 
almost all of our long term investments are in privately held or restricted securities  the valuation of which is necessarily subjective 
actual values may differ materially from our estimated fair value 
portfolio valuations are determined quarterly by the management company  subject to the approval of the board of directors  and are based on a number of relevant factors 
most of our portfolio companies utilize leverage  and the leverage magnifies the return on our investments 
for example  if a portfolio company has a total enterprise value of million and million in funded indebtedness  its equity is valued at million 
if the enterprise value increases or decreases by  to million or million  respectively  the value of the equity increases or decreases by  to million or 
million  respectively 
this disproportionate increase or decrease adds a level of volatility to our equity oriented portfolio securities 
we derive our cash flow from interest and dividends received and sales of securities from our investment portfolio 
we pay certain administrative costs  management fees to the management company overseeing the portfolio  and interest expense on our existing debt 
we also spend our cash on new investments  or follow on investments which may be required by certain portfolio companies 
historically  our cash flow from interest and dividends has not been sufficient to cover our expenses and follow on investments 
because our investments are illiquid  we have utilized leverage to provide the required funds  and the leverage is then repaid from the sale of portfolio securities 
in april and may of  we sold securities of two portfolio companies and paid off our loans 
we have maintained substantial amounts of cash and cash equivalents since may 
table of contents we have distributed to our stockholders any net taxable investment income or realized capital gains on an annual basis 
we declared a net investment income dividend of per share in  all of which was qualifying dividend income 
we declared a dividend of per share in  including per share in qualifying dividend income and per share as a return of capital 
since we are a closed end business development company  stockholders have no right to present their shares to the fund for redemption 
because our shares might trade at a discount  our board of directors has determined that it would be in the best interest of our stockholders for the fund to be authorized to attempt to reduce or eliminate the market value discount from net asset value 
accordingly  from time to time we may  but we are not required to  repurchase our shares including by means of tender offers to attempt to reduce or eliminate the discount or to increase the net asset value of our shares 
significant accounting policies valuation of investments the valuation of our portfolio companies is the most significant area of judgment impacting the financial statements 
portfolio investments are carried at fair value with the net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation included in the determination of net assets 
valuations of portfolio securities are performed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and the financial reporting policies of the sec 
the applicable methods prescribed by such principles and policies are described below publicly traded portfolio securities investments in companies whose securities are publicly traded are valued at their quoted market price at the close of business on the valuation date  less a discount to reflect the estimated effects of restrictions on the sale of such securities valuation discount  if applicable 
privately held portfolio securities the fair value of investments for which no market exists is determined on the basis of procedures established in good faith by our board of directors 
as a general principle  the current fair value of an investment is the amount we might reasonably expect to receive for it upon its current sale  in an orderly manner 
appraisal valuations are necessarily subjective and the management company s estimate of values may differ materially from amounts actually received upon the disposition of portfolio securities 
generally  cost is the primary factor used to determine fair value until significant developments affecting a portfolio company such as results of operations or changes in general market conditions provide a basis for use of an appraisal valuation 
thereafter  portfolio investments are carried at appraised values as determined quarterly by the management company  subject to the approval of our board of directors 
appraisal valuations are based upon such factors as a portfolio company s earnings  cash flow and net worth  the market prices for similar securities of comparable companies  an assessment of the company s current and future financial prospects and various other factors and assumptions 
in the case of unsuccessful operations  the appraisal may be based upon liquidation value 
most of our common equity investments are appraised at a multiple of free cash flow generated by the portfolio company in its most recent fiscal year  less outstanding funded indebtedness and other senior securities such as preferred stock 
projections of current year free cash flow may be utilized and adjustments for non recurring items are considered 
multiples utilized are estimated based on the management company s experience in the private company 
table of contents marketplace  and are necessarily subjective in nature 
most of our portfolio companies utilize a high degree of leverage 
from time to time  portfolio companies are in default of certain covenants in their loan agreements 
when the management company has a reasonable belief that a portfolio company will be able to restructure its loan agreements to adjust for any defaults  the portfolio company s securities continue to be valued assuming that the company is a going concern 
in the event a portfolio company cannot generate adequate cash flow to meet the principal and interest payments on its indebtedness or is not successful in refinancing the debt upon its maturity  the value of the fund s investment could be reduced or eliminated through foreclosure on the portfolio company s assets or the portfolio company s reorganization or bankruptcy 
we may also use  when available  third party transactions in a portfolio company s securities as the basis of valuation the private market method 
the private market method is used only with respect to completed transactions or firm offers made by sophisticated  independent investors 
the fair values of debt securities  which are generally held to maturity  are determined on the basis of the terms of the debt securities and the financial conditions of the issuer 
certificates of deposit generally will be valued at their face value  plus interest accrued to the date of valuation 
on a daily basis  we adjust our net asset value for changes in the value of our publicly held securities and material changes in the value of our private securities  and report those amounts to lipper analytical services  inc weekly and daily net asset values appear in various publications  including barron s and the wall street journal 
federal income taxes we intend to comply with the requirements of the internal revenue code necessary to qualify as a regulated investment company and  as such  will not be subject to federal income taxes on otherwise taxable income including net realized capital gains which is distributed to stockholders 
therefore  no provision for federal income taxes is recorded in our financial statements 
as of december   the fund had a capital loss carryforward of approximately  which may be used to offset future taxable capital gains 
we borrow money from time to time to maintain our tax status under the internal revenue code as a regulated investment company ric 
see borrowings and loss of conduit tax treatment for further discussions of our borrowings 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and unrestricted temporary investments of approximately million 
we had  of our total assets of  invested in portfolio securities of sixteen entities  including twelve portfolio companies  two venture capital funds  and two entities which have disposed of substantially all of their assets and are awaiting liquidation 
 of our remaining assets were invested in us treasury bills for the purpose of satisfying the diversification requirement to maintain our pass through tax treatment 
these securities were held by a securities brokerage firm and were pledged along with cash and other securities to secure the payment of the margin account balance 
the us treasury bills were sold and the margin loan was repaid to the brokerage firm on january  we had a  revolving line of credit with bank of america  na that expired on january  the line of credit was extended through march  at the reduced 
table of contents maximum borrowing amount of  we used our revolving line of credit to pay operating expenses and for new and follow on investments in portfolio securities 
we had  outstanding under this line of credit at december   which was collateralized by our portfolio securities 
in december  we borrowed an additional  from an individual pursuant to a promissory note  secured by  shares of common stock of champion window holdings  inc  due january   in order to fund a follow on investment 
this note was paid in full during april effective march   we entered into a new  revolving line of credit loan with frost national bank  which extends through march  the proceeds of the new loan were utilized to pay off the previous line of credit 
there is no outstanding balance as of december   under the new line of credit  and the availability of such line is approximately million 
in march  the fund extended our revolving line of credit with the frost national bank through april we paid a commitment fee of  to extend the line of credit  and reduced the amount that may be borrowed to  the new loan is collateralized by our investments in portfolio securities 
the provisions of the new revolver include a borrowing base that cannot exceed of the total value of eligible portfolio securities 
interest on the new revolving line of credit is payable quarterly at a rate of 
above the floating prime rate  adjusted daily 
a facility fee of 
per annum on the unused portion of the line of credit is payable quarterly in arrears 
we paid a commitment fee of  at the closing of the loan in march and a  fee in march to extend the loan through april management believes that cash on hand and the new line of credit will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our known obligations  including expected follow on investments  during we declared a net investment income dividend of per share for  or  we paid  in cash and issued  additional shares of common stock at per share on january  we declared a dividend of per share for  or  we paid  in cash and issued  additional shares of common stock at per share on january  under certain circumstances  we may be called on to make follow on investments in certain portfolio companies 
if we do not have sufficient funds to make follow on investments  the portfolio company in need of the investment may be negatively impacted 
also  our equity interest in and our estimated fair value of the portfolio company could be reduced 
as of december   we have committed to invest up to an additional  in the two venture capital funds in our portfolio 
net cash provided by operating activities was   and  for the three years ended december    and  respectively 
approximately million in estimated value of our investments are in the form of notes receivable from portfolio companies 
however  only two notes of the portfolio companies are currently consistently paying cash interest to us in accordance with their respective notes receivable  which aggregate  in fair value 
at december   three of the promissory notes  with an estimated fair value of  provide that interest is paid in kind or that the original issue discount is accreted over the life of the notes  by adding such amount to the principal of the notes 
the fund has agreed to suspend the accrual of additional interest on one of its notes with a cost of  and fair value of  
table of contents because of the nature and size of our portfolio investments  we periodically borrowed funds under a line of credit promissory note to make qualifying investments to maintain our tax status under the internal revenue code as a regulated investment company ric 
our line of credit promissory note expired on january  during and  we borrowed sufficient funds to maintain our ric status by utilizing a margin account with a securities brokerage firm 
there is no assurance that such arrangement will be available in the future 
if we are unable to borrow funds to make qualifying investments  we may no longer qualify as a ric 
we would then be subject to corporate income tax on our net investment income and realized capital gains  and distributions to stockholders would be subject to income tax as ordinary dividends 
failure to continue to qualify as a ric could be material to us and our stockholders 
we have the ability to borrow funds and issue forms of senior securities representing indebtedness or stock  such as preferred stock  subject to certain restrictions 
net taxable investment income and net taxable realized gains from the sales of portfolio investments are intended to be distributed at least annually  to the extent such amounts are not reserved for payment of expenses and contingencies or to make follow on or new investments 
pursuant to the restrictions in our existing line of credit  we are not allowed to incur additional indebtedness unless approved by the lender 
we reserve the right to retain net long term capital gains in excess of net short term capital losses for reinvestment or to pay contingencies and expenses 
such retained amounts  if any  will be taxable to us as long term capital gains and stockholders will be able to claim their proportionate share of the federal income taxes paid by the fund on such gains as a credit against their own federal income tax liabilities 
stockholders will also be entitled to increase the adjusted tax basis of their fund shares by the difference between their undistributed capital gains and their tax credit

we do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate any of these risks 
the return on our investments is generally not affected by foreign currency fluctuations 
our investments in portfolio securities consist of some fixed rate debt securities 
since the debt securities are generally priced at a fixed rate  changes in interest rates do not directly impact interest income 
in addition  changes in market interest rates are not typically a significant factor in our determination of fair value of these debt securities  since the securities are generally held to maturity 
their fair values are determined on the basis of the terms of the debt security and the financial condition of the issuer

however  significant changes in market equity prices can have a longer term effect on valuations of private companies  which could affect the carrying value and the amount and timing of gains or losses realized on these investments 
a portion of our investment portfolio also consists of common stocks in publicly traded companies 
these investments are directly exposed to equity price risk  in that a hypothetical ten percent change in these equity prices would result in a similar percentage change in the fair value of these securities
