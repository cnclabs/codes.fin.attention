the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this annual report 
historical results and percentage relationships among any amounts in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future periods 
critical accounting policies our policies are more fully described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
we recognize product revenues upon shipment 
if a product sale does not meet all of the above criteria  the sale is deferred until all criteria are met 
provisions are made at the time of revenue recognition for any applicable warranty costs expected to be incurred 
periodically  we sell products together with a product upgrade option that requires that the customer pay an upgrade fee at the time of exercise  has no refund provisions and includes an expiration date on the upgrade option 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we defer the fair value ascribed to the upgrade option until the expiration of the upgrade option or the exercise of the upgrade option and shipment of the product upgrade 
revenues from the sale of service contracts is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the service contract 
revenues from services administered by us that are not covered by a service contract are recognized as the services are provided 
in certain instances  we sell products together with service contracts 
we recognize revenue on such multiple element arrangements in accordance with sab and eitf  based on the relative fair market value of each element 
we recognize royalty revenue from licensees upon receipt of cash payments since the royalty amounts are not fixed and determinable at the end of a quarter 
in general  licensees are obligated to make payments days after the end of each quarter 
we account for funded development revenue from gillette and johnson johnson consumer companies  inc jjcc in accordance with the work plan that was developed with both gillette and jjcc 
revenue is recognized under the contracts as costs are incurred and services are rendered 
any amounts received in advance of costs incurred and services rendered from gillette or jjcc are recorded as deferred revenue 
payments from both gillette and jjcc are non refundable if the development is not successful 
we provide services under a million research contract with the united states department of the army to develop a self treatment light based device for pseudofolliculitis barbae or pfb 
the contract is a cost plus fee arrangement whereby we are reimbursed for the expenses incurred in connection with pfb research plus an fee 
revenue is recognized under the contract as the costs are incurred and the services are rendered 
accounts receivable reserves 
allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances 
in establishing the appropriate provisions for customer receivable balances  we make assumptions with respect to their future collectibility 
our assumptions are based on an individual assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends  including the aging of receivable balances 
generally  these individual credit assessments occur prior to the inception of the credit exposure and at regular reviews during the life of the exposure and consider a a customer s ability to meet and sustain their financial commitments  b a customer s current and projected financial condition  c the positive or negative effects of the current and projected industry outlook  and d the economy in general 
once we consider all of these factors  a determination is made as to the probability of default 
an appropriate provision is made  which takes into account the severity of the likely loss on the outstanding receivable balance based on our experience in collecting these amounts 
our level of reserves for our customer accounts receivable fluctuates depending upon all of the factors mentioned above 
we provide a general reserve for doubtful accounts based on the aging of our accounts receivable balances  historical experiences of write offs and defaults 
we also record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on the specific facts and circumstances of particular order  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect reserve requirements  then a change in the allowances would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be adversely affected 
inventory reserves 
as a designer and manufacturer of high technology equipment  we may be exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  reliability and replacement of and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
included in our inventory are demonstration products that are used by our sales organization 
we account for such products as we do with any other finished goods item in our inventory in accordance with the review of our entire inventory 
we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
assumptions used in determining our estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted in the future 
if inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such as cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
although we perform a detail review of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
additionally  purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of its inventory to its net realizable value 
warranty provision 
we typically offer a one year warranty for all of our products 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time product revenue is recognized 
factors that affect our warranty reserves include the number of units sold  historical and anticipated rates of warranty repairs and the cost per repair 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our estimated warranty obligation is affected by ongoing product failure rates  specific product class failures outside of our baseline experience  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
assumptions and historical warranty experience are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis to determine the appropriateness of such assumptions 
we assess the adequacy of the warranty provision and we may adjust this provision if necessary 
income taxes 
we currently have net operating loss nol carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future income for federal and state tax purposes 
these nols generate a significant deferred tax asset 
however  we have recorded a valuation allowance against this deferred tax asset as we have determined that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to fully utilize the nols 
should our assumptions regarding the utilization of these nols change  we may reduce some or all of this valuation allowance  which would result in the recording of an income tax benefit 
in evaluating the potential exposure associated with the various tax filing positions  we accrue charges for possible exposures 
based on the annual evaluations of tax positions  we believe we have appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued for possible exposures 
to the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves  our effective tax rate in a given financial period might be materially impacted 
overview we are engaged in research  development  manufacturing and distribution of proprietary light based systems for hair removal and other cosmetic treatments 
since our inception  we have been able to develop a differentiated product mix of light based systems for cosmetic treatments through our research and development as well as with our partnerships with massachusetts general hospital s wellman laboratories and other centers throughout the world 
we are continually developing and testing new indications to further the advancement in cosmetic light based hair removal techniques  cellulite reduction  acne treatment  pseudofolliculitis barbae pfb treatment and skin rejuvenation 
during the year  we continued to build a strong relationship with the gillette company and forged new alliances with the johnson johnson consumer company jjcc and the department of the army 
during  we improved product gross profits by due to a higher margin product mix and the effects of increased sales volume in comparison to the same period in we also strengthened our balance sheet since the end of last year  including more than doubling our cash position and stockholders equity 
the current ratio is now x  up substantially from x at the end of  and we have no long term debt 
our reported revenues for the year ended december   were million  up from million for the year ended december  gross profit from product sales increased to million percent of revenues  up from million percent of revenues in the year earlier period 
we also reported net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   versus net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  over the last three years  most of our revenue has included the lux family of products with their complementary handpieces  offering a suite of applications to the end user at a lower cost than other competing systems 
customers can invest in their first lux system with one handpiece then purchase additional handpieces as their practice grows and if they prefer upgrade into more powerful lux systems when ready 
additionally  the lux platform enables us to custom tailor products to fit almost any professional medical office or spa location and provides our customers with the comfort that the system can grow with their practice 
we have kept a commitment to continually provide value to customers who invest in our lux system platform 
we believe the lux family of products are the most affordable and versatile cosmetic light based systems on the market 
the starlux  with it s suite of handpieces  can be used for permanent hair reduction  the treatment of pigmented lesions  vascular lesions  leg veins  acne  wrinkles and other cosmetic applications 
the starlux can operate the luxy  luxg  luxr  luxrs  and luxv lamp handpieces as well as the lux nd yag laser handpiece 
incorporated into the starlux is active contact cooling for safety  smooth pulse technology for comfort  accuspectrum technology for versatility  photon recycling for efficacy and a full color touch screen for ease of use 
the starlux is welcomed into the lux family of products by the medilux  estelux and neolux pulsed light systems 
the estelux was the first lux platform product introduced and can operate the luxy  luxg  luxr  luxrs  luxb and luxv handpieces 
the medilux has more power than that of the estelux  a higher repetition rate and a snap on connector for faster changes between handpieces 
the medilux can operate the same six handpieces as the estelux  which allows customers to add additional applications to their treatment portfolio and provide specifically tailored procedures to meet their demand 
the lower priced neolux was developed specifically for the beauty industry 
the neolux is a simple  three setting device that can operate the luxy  luxr and luxrs handpieces 
our product revenue has increased each quarter during as compared to as a result of the increased product demand for the starlux and lux family of products 
due to this increased demand in the market place  we increased our domestic sales force throughout looking forward  we would expect as our installed base of lux family of products continues to increase that the demand for replacement handpieces will increase resulting in additional product revenue 
during  we continued to bolster our consumer device research and development programs 
in september  we entered into a joint development and license agreement with johnson johnson consumer companies jjcc to develop  clinically test and potentially commercialize home use  light based devices for reducing or reshaping body fat including cellulite  reduce the appearance of skin aging and reducing or preventing acne 
in june  we moved into the next phase of our agreement with the gillette company to develop and commercialize a home use  light based hair removal device for woman 
in addition  in february  we were awarded a million research contract by the us department of the army to develop a light based self treatment device for the dermatologic disease pseudofolliculitis barbae or pfb  a disease that affects combat readiness  unit cohesion and individual moral of over of african american and hispanic military personnel 
we continue to focus on delivering innovative light based systems and products to our customers in order to drive revenue and earnings growth 
recent developments in february  we introduced the visilux handpiece  the luxir and the dermatype skinphotometer 
the visilux laser handpiece features a built in  high resolution camera which projects an image of the treatment area onto an lcd screen mounted on the handpiece 
the lcd screen provides real time digital imaging for clear evaluation and treatment of leg veins and other targets 
the camera magnifies the treatment area to about times the actual size and through a proprietary illumination system enhances the image by contrasting the target against its background  for example  to provide clear viewing of deep veins 
this innovation offers unparalleled visibility  treatment precision and ease of use while offering an additional laser alternative to our specialized family of lux handpieces 
we plan to begin shipments of the visilux handpiece by the end of the luxir infrared handpiece will be offered with the starlux and delivers pulses of infrared light deep into the dermis to create carefully controlled areas of elevated temperature 
this handpiece is pending fda clearance for the temporary relief of muscle and joint pain  muscle relaxation and increased circulation 
we intend to seek fda clearance for creating a smoother  tighter skin appearance as the technology has been shown to trigger a biological response which leads to collagen remodeling in the dermis 
remodeled collagen can fill the skin to smooth out fine wrinkles and minor sagging  and can also stimulate increased collagen production to create visible long term results 
this is our first handpiece to utilize infrared light for the treatment of skin rejuvenation 
we plan to begin shipments of the luxir handpiece by the end of the dermatype skinphotometer measures the melanin and blood content of skin in a matter of seconds 
with this device  our customers will be able to quickly and accurately determine appropriate system settings for each patient to insure the safest and most accurate treatments are provided 
the dermatype skinphotometer can be used in conjunction with the starlux  medilux  estelux or neolux systems  resulting in treatments perfectly tailored to the patient s individual skin type 
this device is not yet available for sale 
we intend to seek fda clearance for this device in the near future and begin shipments of the dermatype skinphotometer this summer 
results of operations year compared to year the following table contains selected statement of operations information  which serves as the basis of the discussion of our results of operations for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands  except for percentages change to amount as a of total revenues amount as a of total revenues change change revenues product revenues    royalty revenues   funded product development revenues    total revenues    cost and expenses cost of product revenues    cost of royalty revenues   research development    selling marketing    general administrative    total costs expenses    income from operations    interest income interest expense other income expense income before benefit from income taxes    benefit from income taxes net income    product revenues 
sales of the newly introduced starlux pulsed light and laser system coupled with its additional handpieces were the leading contributor to our increase in product revenues

cost of product revenues 
the cost of product revenues increased in absolute dollars  but decreased as a percentage of total revenue to in from in the increase in absolute dollars is directly attributable to increased variable costs associated with increased product sales 
this cost decreased as a percentage of total revenue primarily due to a shift in sales mix to the higher priced starlux pulsed light and laser system and the other lux family of products from sales of higher cost to produce legacy products such a the slp and rd the lux family of products carry lower manufacturing costs as a result of their modular design 
in addition  increased sales volume has improved the absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead at our manufacturing facility as approximately of our manufacturing overhead cost is fixed in nature and is spread over much higher sales volumes 
cost of royalty revenues 
as a percentage of royalty revenues  the cost of royalty revenues was consistent at in accordance with our license agreement with massachusetts general hospital for each period in comparison to the same periods in the increase in the cost of royalty revenues in absolute dollars is attributed to our settlement agreement with lumenis

funded product development revenues 
for the year ended  funded product development revenue of million was for work performed in connection with payments made by gillette 
on february   we entered into a development and license agreement with gillette to complete development and commercialize a home use  light based hair removal device for women 
see note  development and license agreement with gillette and exhibit  the development and license agreement with the gillette company effective february  with redacted exhibits cost of product revenues 
the cost of product revenues decreased as a percentage of product revenue to in from in this cost decreased as a percentage of product revenue primarily due to improved gross profit recognized on the lux family of products as a result of lower manufacturing costs associated with the lux product lines 
in addition  the increased sales volume has improved the absorption of manufacturing overhead at our manufacturing facility for each product line 
in connection with our increased focus on the lux product lines and a de emphasis and discontinuation of certain other existing products  during the fourth quarter of  we wrote off an additional  to cost of product revenues relating to the slp and rd product lines 
approximately  was written off in relation to the slp product line for prior generation and obsolete and excess inventory and  was written off in relation to the rd product line for excess inventories 
while we have discontinued the active marketing of certain products  we remain committed to servicing both product lines and will maintain adequate service inventories for each 
during  we experienced unusually high warranty claims for the slp due to issues related to a key component 
accordingly  we increased our warranty reserve by  in the third quarter of bringing the total warranty reserve related to this key component to approximately  during  we qualified a new vendor for the key component and began replacing this key component 
as of the end of  we believed that the replacement part had effectively rectified the problem and that the warranty reserve was significantly in excess of estimated requirements 
consequently  we decreased our warranty reserve and reduced cost of goods sold by approximately  in the fourth quarter of cost of royalty revenues 
as a percentage of royalty revenues  the cost of royalty revenues was consistent at for both periods 
the decrease in royalty revenues is attributed to lumenis failure to make its royalty payments resulting in a reduced cost of royalty due to massachusetts general hospital

we have fully reserved our otherwise recognizable deferred tax asset  as its realization is uncertain 
liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of key components of our liquidity and capital resources s omitted except in current ratio calculation change to at december  dollars operating cash flows    investing cash flows    financing cash flows    capital expenditures  net additionally  our cash position  working capital  accounts receivable  inventories  working capital and current ratio are shown below for the periods indicated 
change to at december  dollars cash and cash equivalents   available for sale investments  at market value    accounts receivable  net   inventories  net    working capital    as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and available for sale investments 
we believe that our current cash balances and expected future cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures and other activities for at least the next months 
as of december   we had no borrowings or long term debt 
cash provided by operating activities increased for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period in this increase primarily reflects the effects of an increase in net profit and a decrease in working capital requirements 
cash used in investing activities decreased during compared to the same period in these amounts primarily reflect cash used for purchases of property and equipment  purchases of available for sale investments offset by proceeds from the sale of available for sale investments 
cash provided by financing activities decreased for the twelve month period ended december  compared to the same period in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in sales of common stock offset partially due to an increase in exercises of stock options 
we anticipate that capital expenditures for will total approximately  consisting primarily of machinery  equipment  computers and peripherals 
we expect to finance these expenditures with cash on hand 
on february   we entered into a development and license agreement with gillette to complete development and commercialize a home use  light based  hair removal device for women 
the agreement provides up to million in initial development support funding to be paid by gillette to us over approximately the first months of the agreement 
on june   palomar and the gillette company announced that they completed the initial phase of this agreement  and both parties moved into the next phase 
the original agreement provided for million in development funding from gillette 
under this amendment  gillette will provide million in additional development funding to further technical innovations over a month extension of the development phase  which is now planned to be completed by august  we recognized million of funded product development revenues from gillette during the twelve months ended december  any amounts received in advance of services performed are recorded as deferred revenue 
payments are not refundable if the development is not successful 
in the first quarter of  we began providing services under a million research contract with the department of the army to develop a light based self treatment device for pseudofolliculitis barbae or pfb 
the contract is a cost plus fee arrangement whereby we are reimbursed for the expenses incurred in connection with pfb research plus an fee 
revenue is recognized under the contract as the costs are incurred and the services are rendered 
this revenue is included in funded product development revenue in the accompanying statements of operations 
though the project was scheduled to last for nineteen months  we now believe it will need several more months to complete the work 
we recognized million of funded product development revenues from the department of the army during the twelve months ended december  on june   we announced that we had reached a settlement agreement with lumenis resolving their on going litigation concerning both patent infringement and contractual matters 
pursuant to the settlement  the federal action in the northern district of california and the state court action in massachusetts were dismissed with prejudice 
under the terms of the settlement  lumenis paid  in the second quarter for back owed royalties from sales of the lightsheer made prior to july  and agreed to pay million over the next six quarters  or  per quarter  for back owed royalties due on sales of the lightsheer made between july  and december  beginning on january   lumenis agreed to pay us a royalty on sales of the lightsheer and other professional laser hair removal devices and modules 
in addition  lumenis granted us a paid up license to a variety of lumenis patents for our light based devices 
we granted lumenis a paid up license to the and patents for lumenis lamp based devices 
both parties have agreed to the validity and enforceability of each others patents and not to challenge such validity and enforceability in the future 
for the twelve months ended december   lumenis made payments of approximately million relating to the royalty and approximately million for back owed royalties recorded as royalty revenue 
effective as of september   we entered into a joint development and license agreement with johnson johnson consumer companies  inc jjcc  a johnson johnson company  to develop and commercialize home use  light based devices in the fields of i reducing or reshaping body fat including cellulite  ii reducing appearance of skin aging  and iii reducing or preventing acne 
the agreement provides for jjcc to fund our research and clinical studies during an initial proof of principle phase 
at the end of the proof of principle phase  jjcc will decide whether or not to continue with one or more of the devices in one or more of the fields into a development phase 
upon jjcc deciding to continue  jjcc will be obligated to fund the development of the selected devices 
if jjcc decides not to continue  we may proceed in fields not selected by jjcc to develop and commercialize these and other devices on our own or with a different party 
at the end of the development phase  jjcc will decide whether or not to commercialize one or more of the devices in one or more fields 
upon jjcc deciding to commercialize one or more of the devices  jjcc will make payments to us for each selected field 
upon commercial launch of the first device in each selected field  jjcc will make a payment to us  and for all devices sold for use in each selected field  jjcc shall pay us a percentage of sales of such devices and certain topical compounds 
if jjcc decides not to commercialize or fails to launch a device  we may proceed in fields not selected by jjcc to develop and commercialize these and other devices on our own or with a different party 
we recognized  of funded product development revenues from jjcc during the twelve months ended december  any amounts received in advance of services performed are recorded as deferred revenue 
payments are not refundable if the development is not successful 
contractual obligations on august   we entered into a new agreement with massachusetts general hospital whereby it agreed to conduct clinical and non clinical research in the field of photo thermal removal or reduction of hair  using light 
the agreement has a term of three years  until august  and we will provide massachusetts general hospital at least  on an annual basis to cover the direct and indirect costs of the research 
we have the right to exclusively license  on royalty terms to be negotiated  the inventions we fund that are discovered during this research 
we are a party to a license agreement  as amended  with massachusetts general hospital whereby we are obligated to pay royalties to massachusetts general hospital for sales of certain products as well as of royalties received from third parties 
royalty expense in totaled approximately million 
we are obligated to make future payments under various contracts  including non cancelable inventory purchase commitments and our operating lease relating to our burlington  massachusetts manufacturing  research and development and administrative offices 
the following table summarizes our estimated contractual cash obligations as of december   excluding royalty and employment obligations because they are variable and or subject to uncertain timing s omitted payments due by period at december  total less than year years years after years operating lease   purchase commitments   total contractual cash obligations    recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r revises sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas r will require compensation costs related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements with limited exceptions 
the amount of compensation cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  we will adopt the standard as of the effective date 
see note  stock based compensation for the effect on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter the amendments made by statement clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and require the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe there will be a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations from the adoption of the provisions of sfas cautionary statements our future revenue may decrease if we are unable to successfully develop and market new products 
light based technology is rapidly changing and improving 
in order to be successful  we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to develop in a timely and cost effective manner  new products that meet changing market demands  enhance existing products  and achieve market acceptance for such products 
we have in the past experienced delays in developing and marketing new products and enhancing existing products 
furthermore  some of our new products under development are based on unproven technology and or technology with which we have no previous experience 
in addition  the market for professional hair removal light based devices may already be saturated 
at present  broader market acceptance of light based hair removal is critical to our success and we intend to continue our goals of bringing light based hair removal devices to the mass consumer market 
we also intend to continue to diversify our product line by developing cosmetic light based products for uses other than hair and tattoo removal  treatment of acne and wrinkles  and treatment of pigmented and vascular lesions 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement such strategy in a timely fashion or at all and our failure to do so could decrease our future revenue 
our failure to respond to rapid changes in technology could make our products obsolete and we may be unable to compete with companies having superior financial  marketing and other resources 
the light based cosmetic and dermatology industry is highly competitive and companies frequently introduce new products 
we compete in the development  manufacture  marketing  sales and servicing of light based devices with numerous other companies  some of which have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than us 
our products also face competition from medical products  prescription drugs and cosmetic procedures  such as electrolysis and waxing  among others 
we may not be able to differentiate our products from the products of our competitors  and customers may not consider our products to be superior to competing products or procedures  especially if competitive products and procedures are offered at lower prices 
our competitors may develop products or new technologies that make our products obsolete or less competitive 
if forecasted demand decreases  we could have excess inventories which may result in a write off of some or all of our inventory 
we may need to secure additional financing and without such additional financing we may be unable to fund ongoing operations or grow the business 
although we have generated a profit in recent years  we have a history of losses 
we may have to secure additional financing to complete our research and development activities  commercialize our current and proposed light based products  and fund ongoing operations 
however  there can be no assurance that such financing will be obtained 
we may also determine  depending upon the opportunities available  to seek additional debt or equity financing to fund the costs of operations or expansion 
additionally  if we incur indebtedness to fund increased levels of accounts receivable  finance the acquisition of capital equipment  or if we issue debt securities in connection with any acquisition we will be subject to risks associated with incurring substantial additional indebtedness 
our quarterly operating results are and may continue to be volatile  and that may hurt the price of our common stock 
if our operating results fall below the expectations of investors or public market analysts  the price of our common stock could decline 
failure to receive shipments of critical components could reduce revenues and reduced reliability of critical components could increase expenses 
we develop light based systems that incorporate third party components 
some of these items are custom made or otherwise not readily available on the market 
we purchase some of these components from small  specialized vendors that are not well capitalized 
a disruption in the delivery of these key components could prevent us from manufacturing products and result in a decrease in revenue 
we depend on an acceptable level of reliability for purchased components 
reliability below expectations for key components could have an adverse affect on inventory and inventory reserves 
our products are subject to numerous medical device regulations 
compliance is expensive and time consuming 
without necessary clearances  we may be unable to sell products and compete effectively 
all of our current products are light based devices  which are subject to fda regulations for clinical testing  manufacturing  labeling  sale  distribution and promotion 
before a new product or a new use of or claim for an existing product can be marketed in the united states  we must obtain clearance from the fda 
the types of medical devices that we seek to market in the us generally must receive either k clearance or pma approval in advance from the us food and drug administration fda pursuant to the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act 
the fda s k clearance process usually takes from four to twelve months  but it can last longer 
the process of obtaining pma approval is much more costly and uncertain and generally takes from one to three years or even longer 
to date  the fda has deemed our products eligible for the k clearance process 
we believe that our products in development will receive similar treatment 
however  we cannot be sure that the fda will not impose the more burdensome pma approval process upon one or more of our future products  nor can we be sure that k clearance or pma approval will ever be obtained for any product we propose to market and our failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
our products are subject to similar regulations in many international markets 
complying with these regulations is necessary for our strategy of expanding the markets for sales of our products into these countries 
compliance with the regulatory clearance process in any country is expensive and time consuming 
regulatory clearances may necessitate clinical testing  limitations on the number of sales and limitations on the type of end user  among other things 
in certain instances  these constraints can delay planned shipment schedules as design and engineering modifications are made in response to regulatory concerns and requests 
we may not be able to obtain clearances in each country in a timely fashion or at all  and our failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to sell our products in those countries 
we have modified some of our products and sold them under prior k clearances 
the fda could retroactively decide the modifications required new k clearances and require us to cease marketing and or recall the modified products 
any modification to one of our k cleared devices that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a major change in its intended use  requires a new k clearance 
the fda requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance  but the fda can review any such decision 
we have modified some of our marketed devices  but we believe that new k clearances are not required 
we cannot be certain that the fda would agree with any of our decisions not to seek k clearance 
if the fda requires us to seek k clearance for any modification  we also may be required to cease marketing and or recall the modified device until we obtain a new k clearance 
we may also be subject to state regulations 
state regulations  and changes to state regulations  may prevent sales to particular end users which may decrease revenues or prevent growth of revenues 
our products may also be subject to state regulations 
federal regulation allows our products to be sold to and used by licensed practitioners as determined on a state by state basis 
as a result  in some states non physicians may purchase and operate our product 
however  a state could disagree with our decision to sell to a particular type of end user or change regulations preventing sales to particular types of end users 
thus  state regulations and changes to state regulations may decrease revenues or prevent growth of revenues 
the purchase and use of our products by non physicians may result in their misuse  which could harm our reputation and expose us to costly product liability litigation 
achieving complete compliance with fda regulations is difficult  and if we fail to comply  we could be subject to fda enforcement action 
we are subject to inspection and market surveillance by the fda to determine compliance with regulatory requirements 
the fda s regulatory scheme is complex  especially the quality system regulation qsr  which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design  testing  control  documentation  and other quality assurance procedures 
this complexity makes complete compliance difficult to achieve 
also  the determination as to whether a qsr violation has occurred is often subjective 
if the fda finds that we have failed to comply with the qsr or other applicable requirements  the agency can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions  including a public warning letter or other stronger remedies  such as fines  injunctions  and civil penalties  recall or seizure of our products  operating restrictions  partial suspension  or total shutdown of our production  refusing our requests for k clearance or pma approval of new products  withdrawing product approvals already granted or criminal prosecution 
failure to manage our relationships with third party researchers effectively may limit our access to new technology  increase the cost of licensing new technology  and divert management attention from our core business 
we are dependent upon third party researchers over whom we do not have absolute control to satisfactorily conduct and complete research on our behalf 
we are also dependent upon third party researchers to grant us licensing terms  which may or may not be favorable for products and technology which they may develop 
at present  our principal research partner is the wellman laboratories of photomedicine at massachusetts general hospital 
we provide research funding  light technology and optics know how in return for licensing rights with respect to specific dermatologic and cosmetic applications and patents 
in return for certain exclusive license rights  we are subject to due diligence obligations in order to maintain such exclusivity 
our success will be dependent upon the results of research with our partners and meeting due diligence obligations 
we cannot be sure that third party researchers will agree with our interpretation of the terms of our agreements  that we will meet our due diligence obligations  or that such research agreements will provide us with marketable products in the future or that any of the products developed under these agreements will be profitable for us 
our common stock could be further diluted by the conversion of outstanding options and warrants 
in the past  we have issued and still have outstanding convertible securities in the form of options and warrants 
we have and may continue to issue options and warrants as compensation for services and incentive compensation for our employees  directors and consultants or others who provide services to us 
we have a substantial number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the conversion and exercise of these securities 
such a conversion would dilute our stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our proprietary technology has only limited protections which may not prevent competitors from copying our new developments 
this may impair our ability to compete effectively  and we may expend significant resources enforcing our intellectual property rights to prevent such copying 
our business could be materially and adversely affected if we are not able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  licenses and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary rights 
we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees and third parties with whom we work  including but not limited to consultants and vendors  to restrict access to  and distribution of  our proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
if competitors are able to use our technology  our ability to compete effectively could be harmed 
costly and time consuming lawsuits may be necessary to enforce and defend patents issued or licensed exclusively to us  to protect our trade secrets and or know how or to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of others intellectual property rights 
such lawsuits may result in patents issued or licensed exclusively to us to be found invalid and unenforceable 
our competitors also may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology and which do not infringe our patents 
claims by others that our products infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights could prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products or require us to pay royalties or incur substantial costs from litigation or development of non infringing technology 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
the light based cosmetic and dermatology industry in particular is characterized by a large number of patents and related litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
because our resources are limited and patent applications are maintained in secrecy for a period of time  we can conduct only limited searches to determine whether our technology infringes any patents or patent applications 
any claims for patent infringement  regardless of merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel  cause shipment delays  require us to develop non infringing technology or to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
although patent and intellectual property disputes in the light based industry have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and often require the payment of ongoing royalties  which could have a negative impact on gross margins 
there can be no assurance that necessary licenses would be available to us on satisfactory terms  or that we could redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement  if necessary 
accordingly  an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our charter documents and delaware law may discourage potential takeover attempts 
our second restated certificate of incorporation and our by laws contain provisions that could discourage takeover attempts or make more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of our common stock 
our by laws require a stockholder to provide to our secretary advance notice of director nominations and business to be brought by such stockholder before any annual or special meeting of stockholders  as well as certain information regarding such nomination and or business  the stockholder and others known to support such proposal and any material interest they may have in the proposed business 
they also provide that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the board of directors 
these provisions could delay any stockholder actions that are favored by the holders of a majority of our outstanding stock until the next stockholders meeting 
in addition  the board of directors is authorized to issue shares of our common stock and preferred stock that  if issued  could dilute and adversely affect various rights of the holders of common stock and  in addition  could be used to discourage an unsolicited attempt to acquire control of us 
we are also subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person becomes an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
the application of section may limit the ability of stockholders to approve a transaction that they may deem to be in their best interests 
these provisions of our second restated certificate of incorporation  by laws and the delaware general corporation law could deter certain takeovers or tender offers or could delay or prevent certain changes in control or our management  including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price 
in april  we adopted a shareholder rights plan 
this is intended to protect shareholders from unfair or coercive takeover practices 
in accordance with the shareholder rights plan  the board of directors declared a dividend distribution of series a right for each share of common stock outstanding until the rights become exercisable 
we may not be able to successfully collect licensing royalties 
in past years and now again following the settlement with lumenis  material portions of our revenues consist of royalties from sub licensing patents licensed to us on an exclusive basis by massachusetts general hospital 
we have sued cutera  inc formerly altus medical inc  see legal proceedings for patent infringement  and we are involved in patent disputes with other third parties 
such other disputes may also result in litigation 
we have incurred  and likely will continue to incur  legal expenses in connection with such matters 
there can be no assurance that such litigation will result in favorable outcomes for us 
any adverse result in litigation could weaken the strength of the patents involved  and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unable to attract and retain key executives and research and development personnel that we need to succeed 
as a small company with less than employees  our success depends on the services of key employees in executive and research and development positions 
the loss of the services of one or more of these employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract  retain  and motivate highly skilled employees 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so 
we face a risk of financial exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury 
our products are and will continue to be designed and manufactured with numerous safety features  but it is possible that consumers could be adversely affected by use of one of our products 
furthermore  in the event that any of our products prove to be defectively designed and manufactured  we may be required to recall and redesign such products 
although we have not experienced any material losses due to product liability claims to date  there can be no assurance that we will not experience such losses in the future 
we maintain general liability insurance and umbrella coverage  however  there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us or that such coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred 
in the event we are found liable for damages in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage or if any claim or product recall results in significant adverse publicity against us  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  although our products have been and will continue to be designed to operate in a safe manner  and although we attempt to educate customers with respect to the proper use of our products  misuse of our products by personnel over whom we cannot exert control may result in the filing of product liability claims or significant adverse publicity against us 
disappointing quarterly revenue or operating results could cause the price of our common stock to fall 
our quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and may swing sharply from quarter to quarter 
if our quarterly revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or public market analysts  the price of our common stock could fall substantially 
our quarterly revenue is difficult to forecast for many reasons  some of which are outside of our control 
for example  many factors are related to market supply and demand  including potential increases in the level and intensity of price competition between our competitors and us  potential decrease in demand for our products and possible delays in market acceptance of our new products 
other factors are related to our customers and include changes in or extensions of our customers budgeting and purchasing cycles and changes in the timing of product sales in anticipation of new product introductions or enhancements by us or our competitors 
factors related to our operations may also cause quarterly revenue or operating results to fall below expectations  including absence of significant product backlogs  our effectiveness in our manufacturing process  unsatisfactory performance of our distribution channels  service providers  or customer support organizations  and timing of any acquisitions and related costs 
we face risks associated with product warranties 
we could incur substantial costs as a result of product failures for which we are responsible under warranty obligations 
because we derive a significant amount of our revenue from international sales  we are susceptible to currency fluctuations  long payment cycles  credit risks and other risks associated with conducting business overseas 
we sell a significant amount of our products and services outside the us international product revenue  consisting of sales from our distributors in japan  europe  australia  asia pacific rim and south and central america and sales shipped directly to international locations from the united states was of total product revenue for the year ended  and we expect that international sales will continue to be significant 
as a result  a major part of our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected by risks associated with international sales 
in particular  longer payment cycles common in foreign markets  credit risk and delays in obtaining necessary import or foreign regulatory approvals for products may occur 
in addition  significant fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies could cause us to lower our prices and thus reduce our profitability  or could cause prospective customers to push out orders to later dates because of the increased relative cost of our products in the aftermath of a currency devaluation or currency fluctuation 
managing our relationship with gillette effectively may divert the attention of key technical personnel and management from the core business 
if gillette ends the relationship our stock price could fall  and we may be unable to bring a home use hair removal device for women to the market 
on february   we entered into a development and license agreement with gillette to complete development and commercialize a home use  light based hair removal device for women 
on june  palomar and gillette announced that they completed the initial phase of their agreement and that both parties would move into the next phase 
in conjunction with entering this next phase  the parties amended the agreement to provide for additional development funding to further technical innovations 
we believe that this represents a unique opportunity to bring light based devices to the mass market 
under the agreement  significant resources and the attention of key technical personnel and management will be directed to the development of such a device even though such device will not likely be commercialized for several years  if ever 
in addition  we cannot be sure that gillette will agree with our interpretation of the terms of the agreement  that the agreement will provide us with marketable products in the future or that we will receive payments for any of the products developed under the agreement 
during the term of the agreement  gillette has the ability to choose not to continue and may terminate the agreement 
if gillette terminates the agreement  the price of our common stock could fall significantly  and we will not receive certain payments 
we may proceed to develop and commercialize the device on our own or with a third party 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement such a strategy 
in addition  after commercialization of such device  gillette is to pay us a percentage of net sales of such device 
certain of these percentages of net sales are only owed if the device is covered by valid patents 
there can be no assurance that valid patents will cover the device in any or all countries  in which the device will be manufactured  used or sold 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
managing our contract with the army effectively may divert the attention of key technical personnel and management from the core business 
we may be unable to complete the project within the time period which may impact our ability to receive future government contracts 
on february   we announced that we were awarded a million research contract by the department of the army to develop a light based self treatment device for pseudofolliculitis barbae or pfb 
we believe this represents a unique opportunity to address pfb 
although the project was scheduled to last for nineteen months  we now believe it will take several additional months to complete the work 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete the project within that time period which may impact our ability to receive future government contracts 
under the agreement  significant resources and the attention of key technical personnel and management will be directed to the development of such a device even though such device will not likely be ready for military use for several years  if ever 
managing our relationship with johnson johnson consumer companies jjcc effectively may divert the attention of key technical personnel and management from the core business 
if jjcc ends the relationship our stock price could fall  and we may be unable to bring to market home use  devices for i reducing or reshaping body fat including cellulite  ii reducing appearance of skin aging  and iii reducing or preventing acne 
on september   we entered into a development and license agreement with johnson johnson consumer companies  inc jjcc  a johnson johnson company  to develop and commercialize home use  light based devices in the fields of i reducing or reshaping body fat including cellulite  ii reducing appearance of skin aging  and iii reducing or preventing acne

in addition  after commercialization of such device  jjcc is to pay us a percentage of net sales of such device 
certain of these percentages of net sales are only owed if the device is covered by valid patents 
there can be no assurance that valid patents will cover these devices in any or all countries  in which the devices will be manufactured  used or sold 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk 
our investment portfolio of cash equivalents and debt securities is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but we believe this risk is immaterial because of the short term nature of these investments
