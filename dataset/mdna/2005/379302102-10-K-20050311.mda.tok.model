for purposes of computing occupancy statistics  anchors are defined as tenants whose space is equal to or greater than  square feet of gla 
this definition is consistent with the industry s standard definition determined by the international council of shopping centers icsc 
all tenant spaces less than  square feet and outparcels are considered to be stores

table of contents growth strategies and operating policies management of the company believes per share growth in both net income and funds from operations ffo are important factors in enhancing shareholder value 
the company believes that the presentation of ffo provides useful information to investors and a relevant basis for comparison among reits 
specifically  the company believes that ffo is a supplemental measure of the company s operating performance as it is a recognized standard in the real estate industry  in particular  real estate investment trusts 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income loss available to common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo does include impairment losses for properties held for use and held for sale 
the company s ffo may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate investment trusts 
ffo does not represent cash flow from operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap  as an indication of the company s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap  as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make cash distributions 
a reconciliation of ffo to net income available to common shareholders is provided in item grt intends to operate in a manner consistent with the requirements of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  applicable to reits and related regulations with respect to the composition of the company s portfolio and the derivation of income unless  because of circumstances or changes in the code or any related regulation  the trustees of grt determine that it is no longer in the best interests of grt to qualify as a reit 
the company s acquisition strategies are to selectively acquire strategically located properties in markets where management has extensive operating experience 
such strategy is focused on dominant anchored retail properties within the top metropolitan markets by population that have near term upside potential or offer advantageous opportunities for the company 
the following factors  among others  are considered by the company in making acquisitions i the geographic area and type of property  ii the location  construction quality  condition and design of the property  iii the current ffo generated by the property and the ability to increase ffo through property repositioning and proactive management of the tenant base  iv the potential for capital appreciation  v the terms of tenant leases  vi the existing tenant mix at the property  vii the potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory environment of the communities in which the property is located  viii the occupancy rates and demand by tenants for properties of similar type in the vicinity  and ix the prospects for financing or refinancing the property 
the company acquires and develops its properties as long term investments 
therefore  its focus is to provide for regular maintenance of its properties and to conduct periodic renovations and refurbishments to preserve and increase property values while also increasing the retail sales prospects of its tenants 
the projects usually include renovating existing facades  installing uniform signage  updating interior decor  replacement of roofs and skylights  resurfacing parking lots and increasing parking lot lighting 
to meet the needs of existing or new tenants and changing consumer demands  the company also reconfigures and expands its properties  including utilizing land available for expansion and development of outparcels or the addition of new anchors 
in addition  the company works closely with its tenants to renovate their stores and enhance their merchandising capabilities 
financing strategies at december   the company had a total debt to total market capitalization ratio of based upon the closing price of the common shares on the new york stock exchange as of december  the company is working to maintain this ratio in the mid fifty percent range by managing outstanding debt and increasing the value of its outstanding common shares 
the company expects that it may  from time to time  re evaluate its policy with respect to its ratio of total debt to total market capitalization in light of then current economic conditions  relative costs of debt and equity capital  market values of its properties  acquisition  development and expansion opportunities  and other factors  including meeting the taxable income distribution requirement for reits under the code in the event the company has taxable income without receipt of cash sufficient to enable the company to meet such distribution requirements 
the company s preference is to obtain fixed rate  long term debt for its properties 
at december   of total company debt was fixed rate 
shorter term and variable rate debt typically is employed for properties anticipated to be expanded or redeveloped 
competition all of the properties are located in areas which have shopping centers and or malls and other retail facilities 
generally  there are other retail properties within a five mile radius of a property 
the amount of rentable retail space in the vicinity of the company s properties could have a material adverse effect on the amount of rent charged by the company and on the company s ability to rent vacant space and or renew leases of such properties 
there are numerous commercial developers  real estate companies and major retailers that compete with the company in seeking land for development  properties for acquisition and tenants for properties  some of which may have greater financial resources than the company and more operating or development experience than that of the company 
there are numerous shopping facilities that compete with the company s properties in attracting retailers to lease space 
in addition  retailers at the properties may face increasing competition from e commerce  outlet malls  discount shopping clubs  catalog companies  direct mail  telemarketing and home shopping networks 

table of contents employees at december   the company had an aggregate of  employees  of which were part time 
seasonality the shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season when retailer occupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels

we own  lease  manage and develop a portfolio of retail properties consisting of enclosed regional and super regional malls and community shopping centers 
as of december   we owned interests in and managed properties  consisting of mall properties and community centers including one single tenant retail property located in states 
the properties contain an aggregate of approximately million square feet of gla of which approximately was occupied at december  our primary business objective is to achieve growth in net income and funds from operations  or ffo  by developing and acquiring retail properties  by improving the operating performance and value of our existing portfolio through selective expansion and renovation of our properties and by maintaining high occupancy rates  increasing minimum rents per square foot of gla and aggressively controlling costs 
key elements of our growth strategies and operating policies are to increase property values by aggressively marketing available gla and renewing existing leases  negotiate and sign leases which provide for regular or fixed contractual increases to minimum rents  capitalize on management s long standing relationships with national and regional retailers and extensive experience in marketing to local retailers  as well as exploit the leverage inherent in a larger portfolio of properties in order to lease available space  utilize our team oriented management approach to increase productivity and efficiency  acquire strategically located malls  hold properties for long term investment and emphasize regular maintenance  periodic renovation and capital improvements to preserve and maximize value  selectively dispose of assets we believe have achieved long term investment potential and redeploy the proceeds  control operating costs by utilizing our employees to perform management  leasing  marketing  finance  accounting  construction supervision  legal and information technology services  renovate  reconfigure or expand properties and utilize existing land available for expansion and development of outparcels to meet the needs of existing or new tenants  and utilize our development capabilities to develop quality properties at low costs 
our strategy is to be a leading reit focusing on enclosed malls located primarily in the top metropolitan statistical areas by population 
we intend to continue investing in our existing mall properties and disposing of certain community centers as the marketplace creates favorable opportunities to do so

we expect to finance acquisition transactions with cash on hand  borrowings under credit facilities  proceeds from asset dispositions  proceeds from secured mortgage financing  proceeds from the issuance of equity or debt securities  or a combination of one or more of the foregoing 
impact of restatements during fiscal years and  the company increased its provision for doubtful accounts to address the finalization of the billings for the tenant s share of cam  real estate taxes and other recoverable expenditures incurred in prior years 
our process for recording the tenant reimbursement for cam  real estate taxes and recoverable expenditures was evaluated at that time and improvements were made to the process to reduce the risk of significant adjustments in future periods 
based upon their significance  we have determined that these charges should have reduced the tenant reimbursement revenue recognized in prior years 

table of contents accordingly  the company is restating its previously issued financial statements for the fiscal years december  through to correct the timing by reflecting the adjustments as reductions to tenant reimbursement revenue recognized in prior years 
the restatement increases net income by million per diluted share for the year ended december   and decreases net income by million per diluted share and million per diluted share for the years ended december  and  respectively
