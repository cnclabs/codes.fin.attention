undue reliance should not be placed on such forward looking statements  as such statements speak only as of the date on which they are made

additional information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties is also contained in our other periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission  or sec 
overview apollo investment was incorporated under the maryland general corporation law in february we have elected to be treated as a business development company under the act 
as such  we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements 
for instance  we generally have to invest at least of our total assets in qualifying assets  including securities of private or thinly traded public us companies  cash equivalents  us government securities and high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less 
in addition  for federal income tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company  or ric  under subchapter m of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
pursuant to this election and assuming we qualify as a ric  we generally do not have to pay corporate level federal income taxes on any income we distribute to our stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a ric  we will be subject to corporate level income taxes  which could substantially reduce our net assets  the amount of income available for distribution and the amount of our distributions 
on april   we completed our initial public offering as an externally managed  non diversified  closed end investment company that elected to be treated as a business development company under the act 
we commenced operations on april  upon receipt of million in net proceeds 
investments our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors  including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle market companies  the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies  the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make 
we believe that the availability of senior debt capital from banks for middle market companies over the last twelve months has generally increased and has put downward pressure on spreads at the same time that base rates have risen 
we do not expect this increased availability of capital to impair our ability to make longer term investment decisions with our capital 
we remain steadfast with our investment disciplines in selectively investing in appropriate risk reward opportunities within the middle market 
as a business development company  we must not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets specified in the act unless  at the time the acquisition is made  at least of our total assets are qualifying assets with certain limited exceptions 
if we invest in an issuer that  at the time we make the investment  has outstanding securities as to which a 
table of contents broker or dealer may extend or maintain margin credit or marginable securities  these acquired assets cannot normally be treated as qualifying assets 
this treatment results from the definition of eligible portfolio company under the act  which in part looks to whether a company has outstanding securities that are eligible for margin credit 
amendments promulgated in by the board of governors of the federal reserve system to regulation t under the securities exchange act of  as amended  or the exchange act  expanded the definition of marginable security to include any non equity security 
these amendments have raised questions as to whether a private company that has outstanding debt securities would qualify as an eligible portfolio company 
we note that under applicable self regulatory organization rules that govern the ability of brokers and dealers to extend margin credit  many non equity securities issued by private companies may not be effectively marginable 
to address these questions  the securities and exchange commission proposed amendments to the act to expand the definition of eligible portfolio company in a manner that would promote the flow of capital to small  developing and financially troubled companies 
these amendments would define eligible portfolio company with reference to whether a company has any class of securities listed on an exchange 
we continue to monitor this issue closely and intend to adjust our investment focus as needed to comply with and or take advantage of these amendments if they are adopted or of any other future administrative position  judicial decision or legislative action 
our board of directors approved an amendment to our investment policy to eliminate the limitation on investments in foreign securities 
this change was implemented as of august  and any such investments are included as non qualifying assets 
revenue we generate revenue primarily in the form of interest income from the debt securities we hold and capital gains  if any  on investment securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies 
our investments  whether in the form of mezzanine or senior secured loans  generally have a stated term of five to ten years and bear interest at a fixed rate or a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark libor or prime rate 
while subordinated debt and corporate notes typically accrue interest at fixed rates  some of these investments may include zero coupon  payment in kind pik and or step bonds that accrue income on a constant yield to call or maturity basis 
interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semi annually 
in some cases  some of our investments provide for deferred interest payments or payments in kind 
the principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest generally becomes due at the maturity date 
in addition  we may generate revenue in the form of commitment  origination  structuring or diligence fees  fees for providing managerial assistance and  if applicable  consulting fees  etc 
expenses all investment professionals of the investment adviser and their staff  when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us  and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of that personnel which is allocable to those services are provided and paid for by apollo investment management 
we bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions  including those relating to investment advisory and management fees  expenses incurred by apollo investment management payable to third parties  including agents  consultants or other advisors  in monitoring our financial and legal affairs and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies  calculation of our net asset value including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm  direct costs and expenses of administration  including auditor and legal costs  costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents with the sec  interest payable on debt  if any  incurred to finance our investments  offerings of our common stock and other securities  registration and listing fees  fees payable to third parties  including agents  consultants or other advisors  relating to  or associated with  evaluating and making investments  transfer agent and custodial fees  
table of contents taxes  independent directors fees and expenses  marketing and distribution related expenses  the costs of any reports  proxy statements or other notices to stockholders  including printing and postage costs  our allocable portion of the fidelity bond  directors and officers errors and omissions liability insurance  and any other insurance premiums  organization and offering  and all other expenses incurred by us or apollo administration in connection with administering our business  such as our allocable portion of overhead under the administration agreement  including rent and our allocable portion of the cost of our chief compliance officer and chief financial officer and their respective staffs 
we expect our general and administrative operating expenses related to our ongoing operations to remain generally stable or decline slightly as a percentage of our assets in future periods 
incentive fees  interest expense and costs relating to future offerings of securities would be additive

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
changes in the economic environment  financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ 
in addition to the discussion below  our critical accounting policies are further described in the notes to the financial statements 
valuation of portfolio investments as a business development company  we generally invest in illiquid securities including debt and equity securities of middle market companies 
under procedures established by our board of directors  we value investments  including certain subordinated debt  senior secured debt and other debt securities with maturities greater than days  for which market quotations are readily available at such market quotations 
we obtain these market values from an independent pricing service or at the mean between the bid and ask prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers if available  otherwise by a principal market maker or a primary market dealer 
debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors 
such determination of fair values may involve subjective judgments and estimates 
investments purchased within days of maturity are valued at cost plus accreted discount  or minus amortized premium  which approximates value 
with respect to unquoted securities  our board of directors  together with our independent valuation adviser  values each investment considering  among other measures  discounted cash flow models  comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public and other factors 
when an external event such as a purchase transaction  public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs  our board will use the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate and or assist us in our valuation 
because we expect that there will not be a readily available market for many of the investments in our portfolio  we expect to value many of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process 
due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value  the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments  and the differences could be material 
with respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available  our board of directors undertakes a multi step valuation process each quarter  as described below our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment  preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with our senior management  independent valuation firms engaged by our board of directors conduct independent appraisals and review management s preliminary valuations and their own independent assessment  the audit committee of our board of directors reviews the preliminary valuation of our investment adviser and that of the independent valuation firms and responds and supplements the valuation recommendation of the independent valuation firm to reflect any comments  and the board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of our investment adviser  the respective independent valuation firms and the audit committee 

table of contents revenue recognition we record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts 
for loans and debt securities with contractual pik interest  which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity  we will not accrue pik interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that the pik interest is not collectible 
we do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest 
loan origination fees  original issue discount  and market discount are capitalized and then we amortize such amounts as interest income 
upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security  any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income 
we further record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income when we receive such amounts 
net realized gains or losses and net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation we measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment  without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized  but considering unamortized upfront fees and prepayment penalties 
net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period  including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation  when gains or losses are realized 
within the context of these critical accounting policies  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
results of operations as this is our first fiscal year of operations  there is no previous period with which to compare financial results 
operating income for the period april  commencement of operations through march   gross investment income totaled million  all of which represented interest income 
origination  closing and or commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans 
our gross income for the fiscal year also reflects income earned from a significant amount of short term us government securities and other temporary investments held during the ramp up period of our portfolio since our initial public offering 
accordingly  our gross income is generally lower than what would normally be earned had we been more fully invested for the entire fiscal year 
operating expenses for the period april  commencement of operations through march   operating expenses totaled million 
this amount consisted of investment advisory and management fees  insurance expenses  administrative services fees  professional fees  directors fees and other general and administrative expenses 
it also included a non recurring charge of  in expenses related to the organization of apollo investment 
for the period from april  commencement of operations through march   our investment advisory fees totaled million and represented the base fee as provided for in the investment advisory and management agreement 
in addition  apollo investment administration was reimbursed  for expenses incurred under the administration agreement 
no incentive fees were paid or owed to apollo investment management  our investment adviser  for the period april  commencement of operations through march  net operating income for the period from april  commencement of operations through march   our net operating income was million 
net unrealized appreciation on investments and forward foreign currency contract at march   net unrealized appreciation totaled million  of which million was attributable to net unrealized appreciation on our bank debt senior secured loans  million was attributable to our subordinated debt corporate notes  million was attributable to our equity investments and million was attributable to unrealized appreciation on a forward foreign currency contract used to hedge our foreign exchange rate risk on our investment in wdac intermediate corp 

table of contents net realized gains losses for the period from april  commencement of operations through march   we had total principal repayments and exits of million and total net realized losses of on our investments 
furthermore  we realized  from the settlement of our forward foreign currency contract in march and we incurred net realized losses on the sale of our us treasury bills totaling  during the period from april  commencement of operations through march  net increase in stockholders equity from operations our operations generated a total net increase in stockholders equity resulting from operations of million for the period april  commencement of operations through march  based on our weighted average shares outstanding  our net change in stockholders equity from operations was per share for the period from april  commencement of operations through march  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources during the fiscal year  we generated cash primarily from the net proceeds of our initial public offering and cash flows from operations  including interest earned on subordinated notes and senior secured loans as well as from our temporary investment of cash in us government securities and other high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less 
we plan to generate additional cash from borrowings under our senior secured multi currency revolving credit facility 
in april  we entered into a senior credit facility having the term of five years and providing for borrowings of up to million 
the credit agreement will also provide for the ability of apollo investment to seek additional commitments from lenders thereunder in an aggregate amount of up to million 
apollo investment has not yet borrowed any amounts under the credit agreement 
the interest rate generally applicable to borrowings under this senior credit facility will be libor plus basis points 
this facility will be secured by a security interest in virtually all of our portfolio investments including cash and hedge transaction value  subject to certain exceptions 
the senior credit facility contains covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type 
in the future  we may also securitize a portion of our investments in mezzanine or senior secured loans or other assets 
our primary use of funds are expected to be investments in portfolio companies  payment of fees and other operating expenses and cash distributions to holders of our common stock 
from april   when we commenced operations  through march   our net cash provided by financing activities was million  including primarily the net proceeds of our initial public offering of common stock  and our net cash used by operating activities was million 
as a business development company  we are subject to regulations governing our operations that affect our ability to raise additional capital 
if we issue debt securities or borrow money we will be exposed to additional risks 
we did not purchase or sell any of our equity securities other than in the initial public offering 
at march   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million as adjusted for unsettled trades at year end  which we intend to use in our operations 
from time to time we expect to raise capital in the form of new debt or equity capital  including by way of offerings of securities pursuant to our shelf registration 
dividends we intend to continue to distribute quarterly dividends to our stockholders  the amounts of which will be determined by our board of directors 
we have elected to be taxed as a ric under subchapter m of the internal revenue code of to maintain our ric status  we must distribute at least of our ordinary income and realized net short term capital gains in excess of realized net long term capital losses  if any  out of the assets legally available for distribution 
in order to avoid certain excise taxes imposed on rics  we currently intend to distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of of our ordinary income for the calendar year  of our capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one year period ending on october st and any ordinary income and net capital gains for preceding years that were not distributed during such years 
in addition  although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains ie  net long term capital gains in excess of short term capital losses  if any  at least annually  out of the assets legally available for such distributions  we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment 
we maintain an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders 
as a result  if we declare a dividend  then stockholders cash dividends will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock  unless they specifically opt out of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash dividends 
we may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make dividends and distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these dividends and distributions from time to time 
in addition  we may be limited in our ability to make dividends and distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings when applicable to us as a business 
table of contents development company under the act and due to provisions in future credit facilities 
if we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually  we will suffer adverse tax consequences  including possible loss of our status as a regulated investment company 
we cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any dividends and distributions or dividends and distributions at a particular level 
with respect to the dividends paid to shareholders  income from origination  structuring  closing  commitment and other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies was treated as taxable income and accordingly  distributed to shareholders 
for the period from april  commencement of operations through march   these fees totaled million 
contractual obligations we have entered into two contracts under which we have future commitments the investment advisory and management agreement  pursuant to which apollo investment management has agreed to serve as our investment adviser  and the administration agreement  pursuant to which apollo administration has agreed to furnish us with the facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day to day operations and provide on our behalf managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to provide such assistance 
payments under the investment advisory and management agreement are equal to a percentage of the value of our gross assets and a two part incentive fee 
payments under the administration agreement are equal to an amount based upon our allocable portion of apollo administration s overhead in performing its obligations under the administration agreement  including rent  technology systems  insurance and our allocable portion of the costs of our chief compliance officer and chief financial officer and their respective staffs 
either party may terminate each of the investment advisory and management agreement and administration agreement without penalty upon not more than days written notice to the other 
please see note within our financial statements for more information 
at march   we did not have any off balance sheet liabilities or other contractual obligations that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  other than the investment advisory and management agreement and the administration agreement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
during the fiscal year ended march   many of the loans in our portfolio had floating interest rates 
these loans are usually based on a floating libo rate and typically have durations of one to six months after which they reset to current market interest rates 
as the percentage of our mezzanine and other subordinated loans increase as a percentage of our total investments  we expect that more of the loans in our portfolio will have fixed rates 
accordingly  we may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures  options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the act 
while hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates  they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments 
during the period april  commencement of operations through march   we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities 
beginning in december and concomitant with our investment in wdac intermediate corp  we entered into a three month forward foreign currency contract to hedge our exposure to the currency risk associated with this investment 
this contract was rolled into another three month contract in march realized and unrealized gains on these contracts are represented on our balance sheet and statement of operations  respectively  as of and for the period ended march  the open contract is further described in footnote within our financial statements included within this form k
