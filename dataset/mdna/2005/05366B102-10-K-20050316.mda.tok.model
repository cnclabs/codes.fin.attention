risk factors our dependence on the aerospace industry makes us susceptible to negative trends and adverse economic conditions in the aerospace industry 
virtually all of aviall services net sales and operating income are derived from the sale of parts  components  supplies and services to customers in the global aerospace and defense industry 
as a result  aviall services business is directly affected by trends and economic factors that affect flight activity and costs in the aerospace industry  including fuel prices  economic cycles  inflation  labor demands and instability and regulatory oversight  as well as other factors that affect flying activity by the us military and its allies 
reduced flight activity and increased fuel and other costs generally result in reduced demand for parts  components  supplies and services by customers in the aerospace industry 
increased fuel and other costs may also affect the financial health and continued viability of customers in the aerospace industry 
because a high proportion of aviall services operating costs are relatively fixed  reduced sales have a negative impact on its margins and earnings  as lower gross profits cannot be offset by lower expenses 
further  because we purchase parts  components and supplies from our suppliers in advance of orders from our customers based upon our estimates of future demand  reduced demand may have a materially detrimental impact on our cash flow and earnings 
if expected sales do not materialize  our inventory levels could increase  resulting in increased financing requirements and interest expense and reducing the credit available under the credit facility 

table of contents over the past four years  the demand for commercial air transport has been reduced by a global economic slowdown  terrorist attacks and their aftermath  and military activity in iraq and afghanistan  which has accelerated retirement of older aircraft and caused the deferral of nonessential aircraft maintenance and overhaul services 
this has reduced the demand for our parts  components and supplies used on commercial aircraft 
in addition  some air operations have been reduced because commercial airlines  airfreight carriers and other commercial airline related firms around the world are experiencing large financial losses  which in some cases have resulted in bankruptcies 
although passenger and freight traffic increased in  we cannot predict the length of time required for a recovery of the long term viability of the global commercial aviation sector  particularly in the us further  any recovery could be hindered by a number of factors  including slower economic growth  foreign political instability  acts of war or terrorism or higher fuel prices 
in recent periods  we have relied heavily on increased flight activity by us and foreign militaries of aircraft fitted with the rr t series engine to offset the decrease in commercial aviation activity 
the us military and certain foreign militaries may not sustain their current levels of flight activity  therefore  the demand for parts and components for military aircraft utilizing the rr t engine may be reduced 
as a result  we may be unable to realize fully all of the benefits that we hope to receive from our rr t engine parts agreement with rolls royce 
moreover  if some or all of these militaries were to effect an extensive  protracted grounding of their fleets of c hercules aircraft  the primary aircraft on which rr t engines are fitted  our business would be severely affected 
under the terms of our agreement with rolls royce  we are required to purchase million of rr t engine parts from rolls royce in as of february   we have purchased million of rr t parts 
if demand for rr t engine parts decreases substantially  our inventory levels of rr t engine parts could grow to be larger than needed to support our sales  increasing our financing requirements and interest expense and reducing the credit available under the credit facility 
in and beyond  we expect to generate significant sales of cf engine parts 
currently  the end users of a majority of cf engine parts consist of a relatively small number of commercial passenger and freight airlines 
as a result  our ability to realize fully all of the benefits we hope to receive from the ge cf agreement will depend on the continued operation of aircraft using cf engines by these airlines or by third parties if these airlines discontinue the use of those aircraft 
if several of these commercial passenger or freight airlines reduce their demand for cf engine parts due to economic or other factors or if there is an extensive  protracted grounding of cf engines or aircraft using cf engines  our business could be severely affected 
in addition  the demand for our parts  components and supplies could decrease if one or more of our customers were to eliminate or retire one or more of their aircraft fleet types 
further  the demand for our parts  components and supplies could decrease if intense competition in the aerospace industry or other factors cause one or more of our customers to go out of business 
any decreases in demand for our parts  components and supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operation 
we may face difficulty in integrating the ge cf agreement to provide cf engine parts into our business 
if we fail to integrate the ge cf agreement successfully  or it is otherwise terminated  our business and the value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected 
on january   we entered into the ge cf agreement 
subject to earlier termination  the term of this agreement will continue for so long as either cf engine is used on an airworthy aircraft 
we currently anticipate this agreement will generate approximately billion in revenue during its term  with anticipated average annualized yearly sales of million per year for the initial ten years of this agreement 
the integration into our current business structure of this agreement  and our duties and responsibilities under it  may place significant burdens on our management and operations 
accordingly  our business and future operating results will depend on the ability of our officers and other key employees to implement this agreement effectively and efficiently 
our failure to implement this agreement successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or the market value of our common stock 

table of contents although the ge cf agreement is not scheduled to terminate while either cf engine is used on an airworthy aircraft  ge may terminate this agreement if we materially breach it 
in general  ge may also terminate this agreement if we are acquired by a competitor of ge s aircraft engine business or a party that  in ge s good faith judgment and reasonable discretion  does not have the resources and expertise to perform our obligations under this agreement or does not have a reputation for integrity  sound business ethics and compliance with laws 
in addition  ge may terminate this agreement if our delivery performance under it falls below certain specified levels 
in the event that ge terminates this agreement  our business  results of operations and financial condition would likely be materially adversely affected 
if rolls royce or honeywell terminates or limits their relationships with us  our net sales could decline substantially and our business could be adversely affected 
we have two significant  long term agreements with rolls royce to sell its parts 
in addition  we have several long term agreements with honeywell to sell its parts  which are significant in the aggregate 
during  and of aviall services net sales were derived from sales of parts from rolls royce and honeywell  respectively 
we expect these agreements to continue to represent a substantial percentage of our future net sales 
while our agreements with honeywell and rolls royce are ten year agreements  each of these agreements  unlike the ge cf agreement  contains a termination for convenience provision 
these provisions allow the other party to terminate the agreement on the dates set forth below  subject to receipt of advance written notice and any other specific requirements of the applicable contract  which in some instances include an obligation for the other party to pay a termination fee or repurchase inventory 
supplier parts earliest date for notice of termination for convenience notice requirement rolls royce rr t engine parts january  days rolls royce rr engine parts january  days honeywell hydromechanical controls for rr and honeywell lt series engines january  days honeywell honeywell esa and ecs april  days honeywell honeywell esa and ecs june  days honeywell hydromechanical controls for rr t engines june  days honeywell airline and general aviation lighting and electronic products october  days honeywell and rolls royce may also terminate these agreements if we materially breach or fail to make payments under these agreements  or if we become bankrupt or insolvent or commence bankruptcy proceedings 
furthermore  rolls royce may terminate our agreements to provide rr t engine parts and rr engine parts upon days prior written notice upon a change of control of rolls royce  if we are acquired by a competitor of rolls royce  or if we are acquired by a person that is not a competitor of rolls royce and the acquisition causes our credit rating to fall 
in the event that rolls royce or honeywell discontinues production of the items we sell or terminates or fails to perform under our agreements with them  and we are otherwise unable to obtain the parts we need to fulfill our customers orders  our results of operations would likely be materially adversely affected 

table of contents our largest customers represent a major percentage of our total business and loss of all or some of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in  aviall services ten largest customers represented  in the aggregate  approximately of its net sales  and rolls royce  its single largest customer  accounted for approximately of its net sales 
the sales to rolls royce relate primarily to its role as prime contractor for supplying rr t parts to the us military 
the loss of rolls royce or the loss of the business that we conduct through rolls royce with the us military would  and the loss of all or some of these other large customers could  have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
our corporate headquarters  distribution network hub and approximately of the value of our inventory reside in the same building 
if we lose access to  or use of  this building  our business would be interrupted  which could adversely affect our business and operating results 
our corporate headquarters at dfw airport is the hub for our distribution network 
approximately of the value of our inventory resides in this building  and we receive and ship the majority of our inventory from this location 
if we were unable to access this building because of security concerns  a natural disaster or otherwise or if this building were destroyed or materially damaged  our business would be materially adversely affected 
furthermore  any damage to the building could damage some or all of the inventory stored in the building 
if inventory is damaged  the faa could require us to inspect each item before sale  which could take a protracted amount of time and cause us to lose sales and customers 
any material loss of sales or customers would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
while we have a disaster recovery plan to manage the use of our information technology and deal with telecommunications interruptions and other disasters  this plan has not been tested in a disaster equivalent environment 
in addition  we have business interruption insurance to both offset the cost of  and compensate us for  any event that interrupts our operations 
however  the coverage may not be sufficient to compensate us for all potential losses and the conditions to the coverage may preclude us from obtaining reimbursement for some potential losses 
while we have attempted to match our coverage to the most likely potential disasters and events that could interrupt our business  we may not have been able to foresee all the costs and implications of a disaster or other event and  therefore  the coverage may not be sufficient to reimburse us for our losses 
any material losses for which we are unable to obtain reimbursement may have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
our significant indebtedness and other contractual obligations could adversely affect our financial health 
as of january   we had million of debt outstanding  including capital lease obligations 
we also had significant commitments under our parts contracts with rolls royce and ge 
in  we have committed to purchase significant amounts of rr t parts from rolls royce and cf parts from ge 
we also have significant obligations under operating leases 
as of january   we had approximately million of floating rate borrowings outstanding 
in addition  the credit facility allowed for up to million of additional floating rate borrowings as of january  as a result  our floating rate borrowings could increase dramatically in the future 
future interest rate increases will increase the interest expense on our floating rate borrowings  which could be significant 

table of contents our leverage could have important consequences 
for example  it could make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations  including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our senior notes due  or the senior notes  the credit facility and our other indebtedness  place us at a disadvantage relative to our competitors  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to fulfill contractual obligations and service payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing funds available for other purposes  increase our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or the industry in which we compete  limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes  and limit our ability to plan for and react to changes in our business and the industry in which we compete 
we and our subsidiaries will be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future under the credit facility  any debt securities issued under our shelf registration statement and any other debt securities we issue to the extent permitted by the credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes 
although the credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes restrict us and our restricted subsidiaries from incurring additional debt  these restrictions are subject to important exceptions and qualifications 
if we or our subsidiaries incur additional debt  the risks that we and they now face as a result of our leverage could increase 
the terms of our indebtedness and the investor rights agreement could restrict our operations 
the terms of our indebtedness  including the credit facility  the indenture governing the senior notes and an investor rights agreement between the carlyle investors and us  or the investor rights agreement  contain covenants restricting our ability to  among other things  modify our corporate governance documents  incur certain additional debt  make specified payments and capital expenditures  authorize or issue capital stock  enter into transactions with our affiliates  consolidate  merge with or acquire another business  sell certain of our assets or liquidate  dissolve or wind up our company 
in addition  the terms of the credit facility require us to achieve and maintain certain specified financial ratios 
these restrictions may limit our ability to engage in activities which could expand our business  including obtaining future financing  making needed capital expenditures  or taking advantage of business opportunities such as strategic acquisitions and dispositions 
our failure to comply with the covenants contained in the credit facility or the indenture governing the senior notes could result in an event of default that could cause acceleration of our indebtedness 
our failure to comply with the covenants and other requirements contained in the indenture governing the senior notes  the credit facility or our other debt instruments could cause an event of default under the relevant debt instrument 
the occurrence of an event of default could trigger a default under our other debt instruments  prohibit us from accessing additional borrowings  and permit the holders of the defaulted debt to declare amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be immediately due and payable 
our assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to repay fully borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments  and we may be unable to refinance or restructure the payments on indebtedness on favorable terms or at all 
an event of default under the credit facility or the senior notes  particularly if followed by an acceleration of any outstanding amounts  could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents a significant failure of our computer systems or networks could increase our operating costs significantly  cause us to lose customers and otherwise adversely affect our business 
we depend upon our computer systems and networks to deliver our products and services  respond to the needs of our customers  sell and manage our inventory  perform accounting and administrative functions  provide product and other informational services and create ils s electronic marketplaces 
the success of our businesses depends upon our ability to provide superior reliability  capacity and security for both our internet based and dial up systems 
we are continually upgrading our computer networks and software 
our computer systems and networks  and external networks upon which we depend  are subject to factors that may cause interruptions in service or reduce capacity for our customers  including  but not limited to  physical damage  problems upgrading or integrating new hardware or software  power loss  capacity limitations  software defects and breaches of security due to computer viruses  break ins or otherwise 
significant interruptions in service  capacity limitations or security breaches could disrupt our relationships with our suppliers and customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we plan to upgrade our enterprise resources planning software during to our current supplier s latest version 
we plan to use internal resources  as well as the supplier and other outside software consultants  to implement the upgrade during to mitigate the risks associated with the implementation  we have installed a full hardware and software test environment  separate from our operating environment  to thoroughly test and validate the upgrade 
the test environment may not completely match the operating environment during the test phase  thereby reducing the accuracy of our tests 
while we have experience with the software and a detailed implementation plan  all software implementations of this complexity have inherent risks  including  without limitation  potential interruptions in service that could adversely affect our relationships with our suppliers and customers 
competition in our industry is intense 
if we cannot compete effectively  we could lose market share and our business could otherwise be negatively affected 
with respect to aviall services  the market for aerospace parts  components and supplies is extremely competitive  and we face competition from a number of sources 
aviall services competes with independent distributors  redistribution suppliers and aerospace oems that  in the aggregate  offer most of the same product lines to the same customers 
many of our existing and potential competitors have greater resources than we have 
also  many of our agreements with our suppliers  including some  like those with honeywell  which in the aggregate are significant to our business  are non exclusive  and others  like those with rolls royce  permit the supplier to sell its products directly to our customers 
additionally  from time to time  we face competition from individual airlines liquidating or reducing their inventories  and in the future  we may face pricing pressures from airline consortiums pooling their resources to purchase parts  components and supplies at discounted prices 
numerous companies compete with ils in the operation of global aerospace and marine related electronic marketplaces 
our competitors in this area include airlines  manufacturers  distributors  independent companies  and their alliances  and we expect the competition in this area to increase in the future 
these competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we fail to accurately forecast our inventory requirements  we may incur significant costs or lose customers and our business could otherwise be adversely affected 
we use complex rolling forecasts based upon our anticipated product orders to determine what we purchase from our suppliers 
lead times for our product orders vary significantly and depend on factors such as specific supplier requirements  contract terms and the then current market demand for particular products 
if we underestimate our product requirements  we may have insufficient inventory to meet demand  which could result in shipping delays  lost sales and dissatisfied customers 
alternatively  if we overestimate our product requirements  we may accumulate excess inventory  which could result in increased carrying costs and write offs of inventory and related unamortized distribution rights 

table of contents in december  we wrote off million of parts used on older commercial aircraft 
because many of these aircraft were temporarily grounded or permanently retired in the aftermath of the september  terrorist attacks  we experienced reduced demand for replacement parts and components used on these aircraft 
we wrote off this excess inventory because of the likelihood that we would not be able to sell it in the future 
in addition  we may be required to write off inventory and related unamortized distribution rights when we stop selling a supplier s parts or components or when a supplier chooses to compete against us 
any future write offs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if our inventory does not meet specifications established by certain governmental agencies  we could incur significant costs and our operating performance could otherwise be negatively affected 
our inventory consists primarily of new aerospace parts  components and supplies that we purchase from our suppliers 
before any part  component or supply item may be used on an aircraft  it must meet standards of condition established by the faa  the us department of defense or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries  such as the canadian transport authority in canada  the joint aviation authority in the european union and the civil aviation authority in each of australia  new zealand  singapore and the united kingdom 
although regulatory requirements in other countries generally coincide with applicable us requirements  specific regulations may vary from country to country 
in some instances  components  parts and supplies that we purchase must also be traceable to sources deemed acceptable by the appropriate regulatory agency 
parts and components that we own or acquire are subject to changing standards  which could require us to modify or eliminate parts and components contained in our inventory 
aerospace parts manufacturers may also develop new parts and components to be used in lieu of parts and components already contained in our inventory 
in all such cases  to the extent that we have such parts and components in our inventory  their value may be reduced 
if our faa repair authority is revoked or limited  we could incur significant costs and our growth could be hindered 
in  aviall services product overhaul  repair and final assembly activities  which are regulated by the faa  represented approximately of aviall services net sales  including the parts used in these activities 
the faa prescribes standards and licensing requirements for aerospace components and effectively regulates component repair stations worldwide 
comparable agencies also regulate these matters in each of the foreign countries in which aviall services conducts operations 
if aviall services does not have required faa authority for its overhaul  repair and final assembly facilities  or loses the authority once it has been granted  the operation of that facility may be prohibited until it is able to obtain faa authority 
while we believe that aviall services possesses all required domestic and foreign governmental certifications  the revocation or limitation of its faa repair authority would have a material adverse effect on its overhaul  repair and final assembly operations 
in addition  we may be forced to incur unanticipated costs to adapt aviall services overhaul  repair and final assembly operations to any changes in faa regulations 
moreover  for purposes of their own compliance with faa requirements  some of our customers may require us to certify that our facilities  products and services meet certain standards and specifications 
if we fail to meet these certification requirements or fail to maintain our certified status with one or more of our customers  our reputation could be harmed  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents we are subject to risks associated with our international operations  and we may fail to implement strategies that adequately protect us against these risks 
we sell our products to customers located in many countries around the world 
because we sell our products and services outside of the us  we are exposed to risks associated with selling and operating in foreign countries 
these risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates  political instability  limitations on the conversion of foreign currencies into us dollars  and economic volatility 
during  we derived approximately of our total sales from selling our products and services to customers located outside of the us however  only of our total sales were denominated in foreign currencies 
the percentage of our net sales derived from selling our products and services outside of the us could increase in the future 
although we may enter into certain transactions to hedge the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations or take other steps to protect against these risks  we may be unable to fully protect ourselves against these risks 
any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the interests of our principal stockholders may be inconsistent with the interests of our other equity holders 
as of february   the carlyle investors beneficially owned approximately of our common stock  and two managing directors of the carlyle group sit on our board of directors 
in addition  pursuant to the investor rights agreement  we may not take certain actions without their consent  including incurring certain types of additional debt  making specified payments and capital expenditures or issuing any class of capital stock that ranks senior to our common stock 
as such  the carlyle group asserts considerable influence over our operations 
the interests of the carlyle group and its affiliates may not be consistent with the interests of our other equity holders 
although the carlyle investors may dispose of up to an additional  shares of common stock  portions of the investor rights agreement will continue in effect for so long as the carlyle investors continue to beneficially own at least of our common stock 
we could incur significant costs and expenses related to environmental remediation 
various federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations require property owners or operators to pay for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances located on  under or emanating from their property 
some of our current operations  such as our battery repair and brake service centers  use small quantities of hazardous or toxic substances in their operations 
some of our previously owned businesses used certain chemicals classified by various federal  state  local and foreign agencies as hazardous substances 
we have retained certain environmental liabilities related to these formerly owned businesses and or properties and are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup to comply with federal  state  local and foreign regulations related to these formerly owned businesses and or properties 

table of contents these same laws and regulations also impose liability for contamination on persons who sent wastes to  or arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes at  a disposal or treatment facility 
these laws and regulations generally impose liability regardless of whether the entity arranging for disposal ever owned or operated the disposal facility 
in the us  liability can be imposed retroactively and on a joint and several basis 
we have been named a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and the superfund amendments and reauthorization act or similar state laws at several third party disposal sites 
at five of these sites  wastes were allegedly sent by the previous owner of assets used in our discontinued engine services operations 
accordingly  the previous owner has retained  and has been discharging  all liability associated with the cleanup of these sites pursuant to the sales agreement 
although we could be potentially liable in the event of nonperformance by the previous owner  we do not anticipate that we will incur any significant costs in connection with these matters 
we have also been named a potentially responsible party at two disposal sites 
in addition  we have pending lawsuits related to environmental remediation associated with our former properties or with the transfer of waste generated by our previously owned businesses to offsite disposal facilities 
we do not expect future costs in relation to any of these matters will be material 
as a past operator of businesses that used hazardous or toxic substances  we may be liable for additional removal or remediation costs  governmental penalties  property damage and related expenses 
these costs and expenses could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we improperly ship hazardous materials  we could incur substantial fines or damages 
the faa exercises regulatory jurisdiction over and actively monitors the shipment of hazardous materials by air 
some of the products that we sell contain hazardous materials that are subject to these regulations  such as chemicals  oxygen generators  oxygen bottles and life rafts 
we share responsibility with the air carrier for compliance with faa regulations in shipping hazardous materials by air  and we are primarily responsible for the proper packaging and labeling of these items 
if we mislabel or otherwise improperly ship hazardous materials  we may be liable for damage to the aircraft and other property as well as substantial monetary penalties 
if any of these events were to occur  they could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operation 
our failure to comply with the numerous laws and government regulations that govern our business could result in us being liable for material fines  penalties or damages or could restrict our operations 
in addition to regulation by the faa  foreign civil aviation authorities and the us environmental protection agency  our operations are subject to numerous federal  state  local and foreign laws and government regulations 
while we endeavor to comply with all applicable laws and government regulation  our operations may from time to time fail to fully comply with some of these laws and government regulations 
any violation of these laws or government regulations could result in material fines  penalties or damages being imposed on us or could result in restrictions or limitations on how we conduct our operations 
any such fines  penalties or damages or limitations on our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

table of contents advances in technology and evolving industry standards could increase our costs or cause us to lose customers 
the electronic marketplace business in which ils operates is characterized by evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements 
the introduction of new hardware or software or the emergence of new industry trends or standards could render our existing hardware  software or services obsolete  cause us to incur significant hardware  software  development or labor costs or cause us to write off prior investments in hardware or software 
in addition  our failure to introduce new services and enhancements to our existing services in response to changing market conditions  customer or technology requirements or delays from the implementation of our enterprise resource planning software could cause us to lose business to our competitors 
any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including sarbanes oxley  new sec regulations and new york stock exchange rules  are creating uncertainty for public companies 
these new or changed laws  regulations and standards are subject to changing interpretations  in many cases due to their lack of specificity 
as a result  their application may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory bodies  which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
these evolving laws  regulations and standards have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management s time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
our efforts to comply with sarbanes oxley and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and pwc s audit of that assessment has required the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws  regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory bodies due to ambiguities related to practice  our reputation and hence the value of our stock may be harmed 
in addition  it has become increasingly more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance 
we expect that maintaining this coverage will require the continued commitment of significant resources 
further  our board of directors  the chairman  president and chief executive officer  or ceo  and the senior vice president and chief financial officer  or cfo  could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties 
as a result  we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board of directors and such executive officers  which could harm our business 
item properties facilities as of december   our corporate headquarters  aviall services headquarters  central warehouse operations and various product repair shops are located in a  square foot facility located at dfw airport 
this facility is comprised of  square feet of central warehouse and product repair shops and  square feet of office space 
the central warehouse was expanded in january by  square feet 
this facility contains approximately of aviall services inventory and the primary information systems for aviall and aviall services 
we occupy this facility pursuant to a lease expiring in december with a three year renewal option followed by a five year renewal option at the then prevailing fair market lease rate 
in addition  we have a one time option to elect to expand our premises by approximately  square feet 
we must exercise this expansion option before november

each of our domestic real properties is held under an operating lease 
in  we expect to pay million in rental expense for our facility leases 
we believe our material facilities  machinery and equipment are suitable for the purposes for which they are used and are adequately maintained in all material respects 
iso certification aviall services facility located at dfw airport is iso certified 
the iso standard is an internationally recognized quality management system standard developed by the international organization for standardization to facilitate international trade 
item legal proceedings we are routinely involved in legal proceedings incidental to our businesses 
pending matters include actions involving alleged breach of contract  employment discrimination  liability for environmental matters  tort claims and other matters 
in each instance  we are defending the pending legal or regulatory action 
while any legal proceeding has an element of uncertainty  based on presently available information and given existing financial reserves  we believe that the ultimate disposition of all such proceedings and environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows  although certain matters could be material to cash flows in any one year

table of contents we define variable working capital as receivables plus inventories less accounts payable 
in no event should variable working capital be considered as an alternative to working capital or any other generally accepted accounting principle  or gaap  measure as an indicator of our performance  nor should variable working capital be considered as an alternative to working capital as an indicator of our relative liquidity to meet our obligations within an ordinary business cycle 
we believe that variable working capital is a useful measure  along with measurements under gaap  in evaluating our financial performance and our ability to leverage sales and earnings 
in addition  we use variable working capital as a financial measure to evaluate our management of working capital and as a metric to measure contract and supplier performance 
the following table reconciles variable working capital to working capital for the periods presented in thousands receivables  net plus inventories less accounts payable variable working capital plus cash and cash equivalents prepaid expenses and other current assets deferred income taxes less current portion of long term debt cash overdrafts due to outstanding checks revolving line of credit accrued expenses working capital ebitda represents earnings from continuing operations before depreciation  amortization  interest and related expense and income tax expense 
in and  interest and related expense includes the loss on extinguishment of debt of million and million  respectively  in connection with refinancing our debt 
in no event should ebitda be considered as an alternative to net earnings or any other gaap measure as an indicator of our performance  nor should ebitda be considered as an alternative to cash flows provided by operating activities as an indicator of cash flows or a measure of liquidity 
we believe that ebitda is a useful measure  along with measurements under gaap  in evaluating our financial performance and our ability to service our debt and is a conventionally used financial indicator 
in addition  management uses ebitda as a financial measure to evaluate our operating performance 
the following table reconciles net earnings to ebitda for the periods presented in thousands net earnings earnings from discontinued operations earnings from continuing operations plus income tax expense interest and related expense depreciation and amortization expense ebitda

diluted net earnings per share were not dilutive  or lower than basic  in  and therefore  diluted net earnings per share for these periods is presented equal to basic net earnings per share 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we are the largest independent global provider of new parts  supply chain management and other related value added services to the aerospace aftermarket 
the aerospace aftermarket consists of parts needed for the scheduled and unscheduled maintenance  repair and modification of aircraft already in use but does not include parts used in the construction of new aircraft or engines 
we serve this market through our two wholly owned subsidiaries  aviall services and ils 
aviall services provides new parts and related supply chain management services to the aerospace industry  and ils operates electronic marketplaces for buying and selling parts  equipment and services for the aerospace  defense and marine industries 
aviall services purchases a broad range of new parts  components and supplies from over oems  including in some cases several business units within such manufacturers  and resells them to over  government military  general aviation corporate and commercial airline customers  including over airlines 
aviall services also provides value added services to our customers and suppliers  such as repair and assembly services  supply chain management services and information gathering and delivery services 
ils operates electronic marketplaces for buying and selling parts  equipment and services for the global aerospace  defense and marine industries 
with more than  users in over countries  ils s electronic marketplaces contain more than million line items representing over five billion parts for sale 
ils also maintains databases of over million cross referenced us government records  allowing users to research manufacturers and prices for specific parts  locate alternate parts  find additional uses and markets for parts and review us government procurement histories 
our net earnings for the year ended december  of million increased compared to million for the year ended december  our operating income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or compared to million for the year ended december  these results were driven by aviall services sales across all geographic regions and market sectors 
sales of our rr t products were million and million in and  respectively 
aggregate sales of products supplied by rolls royce and honeywell were million and million in and  respectively 
our selling and administrative expense increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   primarily due to normal salary and benefit increases and million of additional costs related to compliance with sarbanes oxley 
our selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales was in both and market conditions were challenging during the course of the combination of record high fuel costs  a slowing of growth in the economies of many regions and the uncertain future being faced by many of our domestic and international airline customers have combined to make our future performance and opportunities less certain 
however  management believes that these conditions also drove the need by both suppliers and customers for the services offered by aviall services and ils  which is one of the principal reasons for aviall s improved results in our future strategy will continue to focus on the acquisition of new long term supplier contracts as well as adding other traditional supplier relationships  delivering superior customer service and investing in technology and infrastructure to increase supplier and customer efficiencies 
we will also continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions and changes to our capital structure 
we believe our ability to grow at a pace similar to that which we have experienced since will depend on the award of one or a series of new long term supplier contracts  the expansion of our traditional supplier base and product offerings and or completion of a strategic acquisition 
the timing and length of the process to procure new long term agreements or relationships or a strategic acquisition is unpredictable 
we are currently actively pursuing a number of opportunities for additional growth  including possible significant  new long term supplier agreements 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to procure any such new arrangements 
to the extent we do secure any such relationship  the economies of scale derived from recent contracts may not be indicative of our future results  particularly in the early stages of new contract implementation 

table of contents we expect net earnings from continuing operations in to be in the range of approximately million to million or equivalent to approximately per diluted share to per diluted share based upon an estimate of the diluted shares 
this corresponds to earnings from continuing operations before depreciation  amortization  interest and related expense and income tax expense  or ebitda  that is expected to exceed million for with depreciation and amortization expense of approximately million 
recent development on january   we entered into the ge cf agreement whereby ge has appointed us as the exclusive worldwide distributor of unique parts for cf engines 
we paid ge a total of million for these distribution rights and initial product inventory 
we currently expect that the ge cf agreement will generate approximately billion in revenue during its term  with anticipated average annualized yearly sales of million for the initial ten years of the agreement 
description of income statement classifications net sales 
aviall services net sales are generated primarily from the sale of new and oem remanufactured aerospace parts  components and supplies 
we sell these products at prices based upon either a discount from the manufacturers published list prices or with a margin above our cost to buy the product 
ils s net sales consist mainly of monthly or yearly subscription fees to access ils s online databases  fees charged to firms listing inventory in the databases  communications fees  revenue from the sale of custom reports and decision support products and fees for developing and hosting customers catalogs 
ils is an information service provider and does not own or sell the parts  equipment or services listed in its databases 
cost of sales and gross profit 
aviall services cost of sales consists primarily of costs incurred to purchase parts and supplies from oems  inventory carrying costs such as shrinkage and excess and obsolescence  and the amortization of the licensing fees for our significant long term agreements with honeywell and rolls royce 
we purchase parts  components and supplies based on discounts from the manufacturers published list prices as specified in agreements with our suppliers 
because the product sold by ils is information  we include the expenses required to maintain and operate the central ils computer system and communications network in our cost of sales 
these expenses include the salaries and benefits of the computer operations staff  depreciation and lease costs for computer and communications equipment  telecommunications expenses and software costs 
gross profit is the difference between the sales generated and the costs related to those sales 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses include all costs related to marketing  sales  planning and purchasing  accounting  finance  and other administrative departments of the two business units and the corporate staff 
in addition  aviall services selling and administrative expenses include costs related to operating its central warehouse and our worldwide customer service centers 

table of contents critical accounting policies the process of preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to use estimates and assumptions to determine certain of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base these estimates and assumptions upon the best information available to us at the time the estimates or assumptions are made 
our estimates and assumptions could change materially as conditions both within and beyond our control change 
accordingly  our actual results could differ materially from our estimates 
the most significant estimates made by our management include our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  reserves for excess and obsolete inventories  deferred tax asset valuation allowances  pension and postretirement benefit obligations and valuation of distribution rights 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and the related management estimates and assumptions necessary in determining the value of related assets or liabilities 
a full description of all of our significant accounting policies is included in note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 
trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
past due status is based on contractual terms on a customer by customer basis 
an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is established based on our estimates of the amount of uncollectible accounts receivable on a customer by customer basis 
we determine the required allowance using information such as customer credit history  industry and market segment information  economic trends and conditions  credit reports and customer financial condition 
the estimates can be affected by changes in the aviation industry  customer credit issues or customer bankruptcies 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when we feel it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
the downturn in aerospace  particularly the commercial sector  has resulted over the past several years in the bankruptcies of several of our commercial aviation customers 
we regularly review our exposure to customers to determine appropriate loss reserves amounts and credit limits  if any  that should be recorded to cover potential loss as well as determining the strategies that could minimize exposure in case of bankruptcies 
while we believe our current reserves for doubtful accounts are adequate  we could be negatively affected if our receivables from several of our major customers become uncollectible 
during the third quarter of  us airways group and vanguard airlines each filed for bankruptcy protection 
during the fourth quarter of  united airlines filed for bankruptcy 
during the first quarter of  air canada filed for bankruptcy and then in us airways group again filed for bankruptcy  as did ata 
throughout  industry experts have questioned the viability of several us domestic airlines because of their cost structure 
the industry has made some progress in dealing with these problems both with and without the protection of the bankruptcy courts 
however  this progress has been partly offset by higher fuel prices  which the industry has not been able to recover through price improvements from the flying public 
in fact  efficient low cost carriers have been able to undermine the pricing policies of the older and usually larger competitors with smaller increases or more departure frequencies 
throughout this challenging period  we have continued to sell to our customers  although sometimes at a reduced rate or subject to credit exposure limits 
this has restricted our business opportunities with these customers and will continue to do so 
aviall services net sales to bankrupt airlines combined during  and were less than million  million and million  respectively  but our revenue exposure to other us domestic carriers is significantly greater 
at december   our accounts receivable with rolls royce  our largest customer  was million  and we had no collectibility issues 
our sales to rolls royce relate primarily to its role as prime contractor for rr t parts to the us military 
pursuant to our parts agreement with rolls royce  we ship us military orders on behalf of rolls royce and then invoice rolls royce for the parts shipped 

table of contents inventories 
we make provisions for excess and obsolete inventories based on our assessment of slow moving and obsolete inventories on an individual part number basis within each product line 
historical parts sales  estimated future demand and product maturity level adjusted for known or expected aviation industry trends or conditions provide the basis for our estimates 
these estimates are subject to volatility and can be affected by reduced or increased flight hours  the retirement or extension of life of aircraft  changes in distribution agreements and other changes in the aviation industry 
we constantly monitor our inventory levels and forecast potential excess or obsolete parts 
we actively track and develop campaigns to sell these potentially excess or obsolete parts 
we make provisions for inventory shrinkage based on periodic physical inventory counts 
distribution rights 
from time to time  we enter into long term supplier distribution agreements that explicitly or implicitly include a payment for distribution rights 
when we enter into these agreements  we must value the distribution rights and amortize them over the life of the agreement 
we calculate the value of the distribution rights using a discounted cash flow model of the expected net contract cash flows related to the specific distribution agreement 
we amortize the value of the distribution rights using the cash flow models adopted to value the agreement over the expected life of the agreement 
in the event one or more of our material suppliers discontinue the products we sell  terminate our contract or are unable to perform under our agreement  the value of the distribution rights could be impaired  and we might be required to write down or write off the unamortized value of the distribution rights 
we regularly review these long term supplier distribution agreements to determine any potential impairment by comparing actual to expected performance 
income taxes 
we establish our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on our profits or losses in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
we periodically assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets and adjust the related valuation allowance based on the amount of deferred tax assets that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we base our judgment of the recoverability of our deferred tax asset  which includes us federal and  to a lesser degree  state and foreign net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards  primarily on historical earnings  our estimate of current and expected future earnings  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  and current and future ownership changes 
at december   we had a million net deferred tax asset of which approximately million relates to our us federal nol carryforwards 
this equates to a gross us federal nol of approximately million  which substantially expires in to fully utilize our net deferred tax assets  as of december   we must generate million of taxable income based on current tax rates 
we generated taxable income of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we establish tax contingency reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge certain positions taken which may result in additional liabilities 
these tax contingency reserves are reviewed as circumstances warrant and adjusted as events occur that affect our potential liability for additional taxes  such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitation  conclusion of tax audits  additional exposures or identification of new issues 
pension and postretirement benefits obligations 
the value of our pension and postretirement benefits assets and liabilities is determined on an actuarial basis 
these values are affected by the market value of plan assets  our estimates of the expected return on plan assets and the discount rates we use to value our projected benefit obligation 
we determine the discount rates using changes in the rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments 
we develop our expected long term rate of return assumptions through analysis by asset investment category of historical market returns  the fund s past experience and current market conditions 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets  differences between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets and changes in the discount rate we use affect the amount of pension expense we recognize

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales for aviall services were million  an increase of million or from the million recorded in sales for aviall services improved in each of its geographic regions and in all market sectors 
the following table presents aviall services net sales increases by geographic region and market sector amounts in millions amount of increase percentage increase geographic region americas europe asia pacific market sector government military general aviation corporate commercial airline sales in the government military sector increased as a result of increased sales related to the rr t program  while sales in the general aviation corporate sector increased primarily as a result of what management believes to be increased market share 
sales in the commercial airline sector increased primarily due to sales of the honeywell airline related products and the continuing industry recovery  especially in international markets 
sales of products under the rr t distribution agreement were million and million in and  respectively 
the net sales amount does not include approximately million of rr t sales  valued at our contractual prices  made directly by rolls royce to the us military during the rr t transition program  which ended in june we received full margin for these sales and assumed responsibility for direct shipments to the us military on rolls royce s behalf at the end of the second quarter of if these sales had been included  aviall services year over year net sales increase would have been

selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased million to million in but decreased as a percentage of net sales to from in selling and administrative expenses increased primarily due to the integration of new honeywell product lines  higher legal and professional fees resulting from changes to our capital structure and sarbanes oxley compliance costs

table of contents impairment loss 
the million impairment loss resulted from the write off of a vendor software license purchased in in the second quarter of  we decided to pursue other alternatives resulting from the vendor s change in strategic focus 
these alternatives will allow ils to proceed in a less expensive and more timely manner with a strategy of offering electronic marketplace capabilities from the initial contact between buyer and seller through the conclusion of a transaction  which ils calls its contact to contract plans 
loss on extinguishment of debt 
on june   we issued million of senior notes

the remaining proceeds were used to repay approximately million of outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility 
this refinancing resulted in a million noncash charge in june arising from the extinguishment of debt

income taxes on october   the president of the united states signed the american jobs creation act of  or the jobs act 
the jobs act provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities  which will be phased in from though in return  the jobs act also provides for a two year phase out of the existing eti exclusion for foreign sales that was viewed to be inconsistent with international trade protocols by the european union 
we expect the net effect of the phase out of the eti to result in an increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal years and of approximately percentage points and percentage points  respectively  based on current earnings levels 
we do not expect to qualify for the new deduction 
foreign operations aviall services operates customer service centers in australia  canada  hong kong  the netherlands  new zealand  singapore and japan  as well as repair facilities in australia and the united kingdom 
these foreign operations use the us dollar as their functional currency because the majority of sales and inventory purchases are denominated in us dollars 
foreign currency translation and transaction gains and losses are included in our net earnings 
there are no current legal restrictions regarding the repatriation of cash to the us from the foreign operations 
our general policy is not to repatriate cash 
however  the jobs act creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad 
the deduction is subject to a number of limitations and  as of today  uncertainty remains as to how to interpret numerous provisions in the jobs act 
as such  we are not yet in a position to decide on whether  and to what extent  we might repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the us the following table shows our foreign operations net sales and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes during the periods shown year ended december  in millions net sales earnings from continuing operations before income taxes liquidity and capital resources cash flow 
net cash flow provided by and used for operations was million in  million in and million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities in resulted primarily from increased cash earnings in aviall services inventory turns improved from turns in december to turns in december due to higher sales volumes and lower inventory levels

as a result of this contract  we recorded million in distribution rights which was paid for at execution 
during  we paid approximately million for the right to sell additional products under our honeywell esa and ecs distribution agreement 
in summary  our cash provided by operating activities improved by million to million during compared to this includes an increase of million in variable working capital see definition below  in the aggregate  in as compared to an increase of million  in the aggregate  in in  we invested million in distribution rights and net capital expenditures compared to million in the combined cash provided in of million from both operating and investing activities together with million received for common stock issued pursuant to the exercise of options was primarily used to repay our outstanding indebtedness and fund debt issuance costs 
this resulted in a million increase in our cash balance 
the combined cash provided in of million from both operating and investing activities together with the million of debt proceeds  the million received for common stock issued pursuant to the exercise of options and the million increase in our cash overdraft position was primarily used to repay our outstanding indebtedness and fund debt issuance costs 
as a result  our cash balance increased by million 
overdraft positions arise when we settle our accounts payable by issuing checks at month end  and the recipients of these checks have not presented them to our banks for payment before our cut off for accounting purposes 
as of december   we classify these overdraft positions as a separate current liability in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet because no right of offset existed against other cash accounts within the same bank 
generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  treat these amounts similar to debt in the statement of cash flows by presenting cash overdrafts as a financing activity 
we expect to continue large month end settlements with our major suppliers  but the overdrafts will change in accordance with the variable amounts of products shipped to us from time to time 
assuming our current level of internal growth  profitability  and the present relationship between increased revenue  variable working capital requirements and our annual capital expenditures  we expect to continue generating strong positive cash flows from operations although these may be offset from time to time by overdraft obligations and increases in variable working capital  particularly when our business is growing 
assuming the foregoing  in we project net cash provided by operating activities will exceed million 
our cash flow from operating activities also depends on the timing of the delivery and payment for inventory as discussed above 
in some months  we receive much larger deliveries than the average for the preceding several months 
these larger deliveries can significantly alter our cash flow for that month and on a cumulative basis for both the quarter and the fiscal year to date 
in  and  we received large deliveries in november  which when paid for in december reduced our cash flow from operations for that quarter and twelve month period 
in connection with our entry into the ge cf agreement  on january   we drew down million under the credit facility to fund the purchase of distribution rights and product inventory 

table of contents the following table presents a reconciliation of our variable working capital to working capital for the periods presented in thousands receivables  net plus inventories less accounts payable variable working capital plus cash and cash equivalents prepaid expenses and other current assets deferred income taxes less current portion of long term debt cash overdrafts due to outstanding checks revolving line of credit accrued expenses working capital we define variable working capital as receivables plus inventories less accounts payable 
in no event should variable working capital be considered as an alternative to working capital or any gaap measure as an indicator of our performance  nor should variable working capital be considered as an alternative to working capital as an indicator of our relative liquidity to meet our obligations within an ordinary business cycle 
we believe that variable working capital is a useful measure  along with measurements under gaap  in evaluating our financial performance and our ability to leverage sales and earnings from our variable working capital 
in addition  we use variable working capital as a financial measure to evaluate our management of working capital and as a metric to measure contract and supplier performance 
liquidity 
we plan to grow our business primarily by selling more of the products we currently distribute  or internal growth  and by selling new products that we obtain the right to sell either through new distribution agreements or through strategic acquisitions  or external growth 
most of the increase in our net sales and earnings over the last several years have been derived from external growth  such as sales generated from the rr t distribution agreement 
before entering into a distribution agreement for new products or substantially modifying the products distributed under an existing agreement  we prepare a financial model of the expected investment in variable working capital and cash flows under the distribution agreement based on detailed plans  estimates and expectations for introducing and selling the products over the term of the agreement 
we construct our financial model based primarily on standard cash flow models used for project evaluation in our industry 
historically  we have funded our internal growth utilizing available cash flows from operations 
external growth has been funded using external financing  such as the credit facility 
our business model assumes that external growth will be funded utilizing internal cash flows and external liquidity sources 
we believe that a continuation of our current level of internal growth  profitability  and the present relationship between increased revenue  variable working capital requirements and our annual capital expenditures  will generate positive cash flows from operations  including cash on hand  sufficient to fund all our internal growth and a portion of our external growth requirements related to new business opportunities 
we have no plans to pursue a reduction in our available liquidity 

table of contents in  we expect to fund our internal growth and any related capital expenditures out of cash flow from operations and borrowings under the credit facility 
if we are awarded one or more additional long term supplier agreements in that require significant investments in distribution rights and inventory  we may be required to increase availability and borrow significant amounts under the credit facility or we may be required to sell debt  equity or other securities under our shelf registration statement or otherwise to fund the costs associated with the investment 
likewise  if we enter into a strategic acquisition or if our current projections prove to be inaccurate in  we may be required to borrow significant amounts under the credit facility or to sell securities 
convertible participating redeemable preferred stock 
on june   the carlyle investors converted all of the outstanding shares of series d redeemable preferred stock into  shares of our common stock  following a reduction by our board of directors of the conversion price of the shares of series d redeemable preferred stock from per share to per share 
we accounted for this as a one time million noncash reduction for the conversion of preferred stock to our net earnings available to common shareholders 
the shares of common stock issued represented approximately of our outstanding common stock on the date of the conversion 
no shares of series d redeemable preferred stock remain outstanding 
senior unsecured debt 
we have million of senior notes outstanding 
the senior notes bear interest at per annum and mature on july   unless previously redeemed at our option 
we may redeem some or all of the senior notes at specified redemption prices at any time after july  in addition  prior to july   we may redeem up to of the senior notes from the proceeds of qualifying equity offerings 
the senior notes are our senior unsecured obligations and are equal in right of payment to all of our senior indebtedness 
the senior notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our domestic subsidiaries 
in june  we used the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes to redeem the entire principal amount of the notes and to repay a portion of the outstanding revolving indebtedness under the credit facility 
in connection with the redemption of the notes  we recorded a million pretax loss on extinguishment  which consists of a million prepayment premium on the outstanding principal amount of the notes  million of unamortized debt discount and million of unamortized original debt issuance cost 
in november  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage interest rate risk exposure on million of the million principal amount of senior notes 
under this agreement  we pay floating interest amounts in exchange for giving up the right to pay a fixed amount without an exchange of the underlying principal amount 

table of contents senior secured debt 
on june   we entered into an amendment to the credit facility to reduce interest payments  change certain financial ratios and covenants and to permit limited repurchases and redemptions of outstanding securities 
on january   we entered into another amendment to the credit facility in connection with the ge cf agreement 
as amended  the credit facility consists of a million revolving credit and letter of credit facility due as a balloon payment in  with availability determined by reference to a borrowing base calculated using our eligible accounts receivable and inventory and after deducting reserves required by the lenders 
as of january   we had million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and had issued letters of credit for million 
in addition  we had million available for additional borrowings under the credit facility and our borrowing base was million 
as of january   borrowings under the credit facility bear interest based upon either a eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin ranging from to depending upon our financial ratios or a base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from to depending upon the same financial ratios 
we expect to utilize both of these interest rate options during as of january   the actual interest rate on the credit facility was 
an annual commitment fee of is payable monthly in arrears on the daily unused portion of the credit facility 
obligations under the credit facility are collateralized by substantially all of our domestic assets and of the stock of certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
the credit facility also contains default clauses that permit the acceleration of all amounts due following an event of default at the discretion of the lenders  and lock box provisions that apply our cash collections to outstanding borrowings 
based on the terms of the credit facility and pursuant to eitf issue no 
 balance sheet classification of revolving credit agreement obligations involving lock box arrangements  we classify amounts outstanding under the credit facility  if any  as current 
we also maintain a secured revolving credit facility in canada  or the canadian revolver  with a total availability of canadian million 
as of january   we had no borrowings outstanding under the canadian revolver 
debt covenants 
the credit facility contains various restrictive operating and financial covenants  including several that are based on earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  extraordinary gains or losses  and one time items  or adjusted ebitda 
we must comply with a maximum leverage ratio covenant that measures the ratio of our outstanding debt to our adjusted ebitda for the trailing four quarters 
this maximum leverage ratio covenant was to at december  under the credit facility  we must maintain a maximum leverage ratio of to for the fiscal quarters ending on or before june   to for the fiscal quarter ending september   to for the fiscal quarter ending december   and to for the fiscal quarters ending on or after march  we must also comply with a minimum interest coverage ratio covenant that measures the ratio of our adjusted ebitda for the trailing four quarters to our interest expense during the trailing four quarters 
the minimum interest coverage ratio covenant was to at december  and will remain at that level for all periods thereafter 
furthermore  we must maintain a tangible net worth of not less than million plus of the cumulative consolidated net income for each fiscal quarter ending on or after june  as of december   the required tangible net worth was million 
we are permitted to make capital expenditures under the credit facility in any fiscal year up to million  plus any unused carryover of up to million from prior years 
as a result  we must limit our capital expenditures in to no more than million  which includes million of allowed carryover spending from prior years 

table of contents the senior notes also contain various restrictive covenants 
we may not incur additional indebtedness unless we maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least to or unless the debt is otherwise permitted under the indenture 
the consolidated interest coverage ratio measures the ratio of our ebitda  as defined in the indenture relating to the senior notes  for the trailing four quarters to our interest expense for such quarters 
subject to specified exceptions  we may not make payments on or redeem our capital stock  make certain investments or make other restricted payments unless we maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least to and otherwise have available of cumulative consolidated net income or capital stock sale proceeds from which such payments may be made

we must receive fair market value for any asset sales and the consideration must be paid at least in cash  cash equivalents or assumed liabilities 
to the extent such proceeds are received  we must reinvest any proceeds exceeding million in additional assets within a period of days or thereafter repay senior debt or repurchase senior notes 
additionally  we must repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to of the principal amount of the senior notes upon a change of control 
the indenture relating to the senior notes also contains additional covenants

table of contents contractual obligations 
the following table sets forth our contractual obligations at the end of for the periods shown in thousands contractual obligation total within year years years thereafter debt service  including interest capital lease obligations  including interest operating leases purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations the million purchase commitment arises from contractual obligations to purchase inventory from rolls royce pursuant to the terms of the rr t agreement  as well as obligations to purchase inventory pursuant to numerous other distribution agreements 
based on our sales projections  we believe these inventory purchases will be consumed in the normal course of business maintaining acceptable inventory turns 
environmental matters aviall services business includes parts repair operations that require the use  storage and disposal of certain chemicals in small quantities 
these chemicals are regulated under various federal  state  local or foreign environmental protection laws which require us to eliminate or mitigate the impact of these substances on the environment 
in response to these requirements  we have upgraded facilities and implemented programs to detect and minimize contamination 
due to the small quantities of chemicals used and the current programs in place  we do not anticipate any material environmental liabilities or significant capital expenditures will be incurred in the future related to our ongoing operations to comply or remain in compliance with existing environmental regulations 
additionally  some of the products  such as chemicals  oxygen generators  oxygen bottles and life rafts  sold by aviall services contain hazardous materials that are subject to faa regulations and various federal  state  local or foreign environmental protections laws 
if aviall services ships such products by air  it shares responsibility with the air carrier for compliance with these faa regulations and is primarily responsible for the proper packaging and labeling of these items 
if aviall services mislabels or otherwise improperly ships hazardous materials  it may be liable for damage to the aircraft and other property  as well as substantial monetary penalties 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
the faa actively monitors the shipment of hazardous materials 
certain of our previously owned businesses used certain chemicals classified by various federal  state  local or foreign agencies as hazardous substances 
we retain environmental liabilities related to these businesses for the period prior to their sale 
we are involved in various stages of investigation  cleanup  maintenance and closure to comply with federal  state  local or foreign regulations at these locations 
based on the current information available  we believe existing environmental financial reserves for these previously owned properties are sufficient 
in addition  we are in litigation with a previous owner of three of these locations as to their potential shared liability associated with the cleanup of these sites 
due to the uncertainty of recoverability of this claim  we have not recorded a receivable 
we have been named a potentially responsible party at five third party disposal sites to which wastes were allegedly sent by the previous owner of assets used in our discontinued engine services operations 
we did not use these identified disposal sites 
accordingly  the previous owner has retained  and has been discharging  all liability associated with the cleanup of these sites pursuant to the sales agreement 
although we could be potentially liable in the event of nonperformance by the previous owner  we do not currently anticipate nonperformance 
based on this information  we have not accrued for any costs associated with these third party sites 
in addition  we have been named a potentially responsible party at two third party disposal sites where we did use the identified sites 
cleanup costs associated with these sites have been accrued and we believe our reserves are adequate as of december  
table of contents as of december   we had two pending asbestos related lawsuits 
at year end  we established a million reserve for these lawsuits 
based on information presently available and programs to detect and minimize contamination  we believe the ultimate disposition of pending environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  or sfas r  share based payment  which replaces statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fas sfas r addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the company or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas r addresses all forms of share based payment awards  including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
sfas r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method and generally would require that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expense over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
sfas r is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after june  we are in the process of evaluating the three allowable methods of transition to sfas r 
we have not yet determined which method will be used 
in  we will incur compensation expense under sfas r  as currently written  related to options granted in and previous periods 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
from time to time  we have used financial instruments to offset these risks 
these financial instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
we did not experience any significant changes in market risk during our objective in managing our interest rate risk on our debt is to maintain a balance of fixed and variable rate debt that will lower our overall borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters 
interest rate swaps are used to convert a portion of our debt portfolio from a fixed rate to a variable rate 
factored into our decision as to the mix of fixed and variable rate debt are two components the borrowings under the credit facility are usually at a variable rate and the ability to adjust each year the prices for inflation on a large portion of our inventory 
in november  we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert the interest rate from fixed to floating on million of the million principal amount of senior notes 
without this action  we would have had no floating rate debt  which does not meet our risk criteria 
under the swap agreement  we pay the london interbank offer rate  or libor  plus an applicable margin 
at december   the interest rate in effect under the swap agreement was  composed of libor of and margin of 
at december   the interest rate in effect was  composed of libor of and margin of 
the interest payment and maturity dates of the interest rate swap match the terms of the debt it is intended to modify 
the fair value of our interest rate swap at both december  and was a liability of million 
fluctuations in the interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt 
at december   we had million of variable rate debt obligations outstanding under the canadian revolver with a weighted average interest rate of 
at december   we had no borrowings outstanding under the canadian revolver 

table of contents at december  and  the total amount of our variable rate debt was approximately million and million  respectively 
a hypothetical increase of basis points in the variable interest rate for these borrowings  assuming debt levels at december  and  respectively  would increase interest expense by approximately million in both years 
our foreign operations utilize the us dollar as their functional currency 
foreign currency translation and transaction gains and losses are included in net earnings 
foreign currency transaction exposure relates primarily to foreign currency denominated accounts receivables and the transfer of foreign currency from subsidiaries to aviall services 
we have sales transactions denominated in foreign currencies in australia  canada and new zealand 
currency transaction exposures are not hedged 
unrealized currency translation gains and losses are recognized each month upon translation of the foreign subsidiaries balance sheets into us dollars 
net currency translation and transaction gains and losses included in earnings amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
from time to time  we have used foreign currency borrowings as a hedge against foreign denominated net assets 
as of december   we had a canadian dollar denominated loan equivalent to us million outstanding under the canadian revolver 
as of december   we had no borrowings outstanding under the canadian revolver
