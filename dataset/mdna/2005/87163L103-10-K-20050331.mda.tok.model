item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we design and develop large screen  rear projection  high definition televisions  or hdtvs  utilizing our proprietary liquid crystal on silicon  or lcos  microdisplay technology 
we market our hdtvs for sale under the brand names of retailers  including high end audio video manufacturers  distributors of high end consumer electronics products  and consumer electronics retailers 
we have established a virtual manufacturing model utilizing third party contract manufacturers to produce our hdtvs  which incorporate the lcos microdisplays that we manufacture 
we also offer a broad line of lcos microdisplay products and subsystems that original equipment manufacturers  or oems  can integrate into proprietary hdtv products  home theater projectors  and near to eye applications  such as head mounted monocular or binocular headsets and viewers  for industrial  medical  military  commercial  and consumer applications 
we derive revenue from the sale of our microdisplay products and from providing design and engineering services 
during  we recorded revenue from product sales of million  or of net sales  and revenue from design and engineering services of  or of net sales 
we have never been profitable 
in   and  we had net losses of million  million  and million  respectively 
we started the development of lcos microdisplays in as a division of three five systems  inc  or tfs  as which we operated until our spin off in september in anticipation of our spin off to the stockholders of tfs  tfs organized us as a wholly owned subsidiary 
in connection with the spin off  tfs transferred to us its lcos microdisplay business  including the related manufacturing and business assets  personnel  and intellectual property 
tfs also provided initial cash funding to us in the amount of million 
the spin off was completed on september  as a special dividend to the stockholders of tfs 
we share occupancy with tfs in a building in tempe  arizona 
we manufacture all of our lcos microdisplays on our high volume liquid crystal on silicon manufacturing line in that tempe facility  where we also maintain our corporate headquarters 
in addition  we conduct all testing and assembly of lcos modules and conduct research and development activities in tempe 
we also operate a facility in boulder  colorado 
in boulder  we conduct sales and marketing activities and research and development activities 
net sales 
our sales result from both design and engineering services and product sales 
until early  substantially all of our sales were for use in projection based applications 
after the purchase of certain assets in early  however  we became equally focused on the near to eye market 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced our intention to design  develop  and sell a complete hdtv product based on our gen ii lcos microdisplay 
since this announcement  most of our efforts have been focused on the design of this product and the establishment of a supply chain to source the components that we do not manufacture 
we currently anticipate that sales of our hdtvs will comprise the majority of our total sales in future periods 
in addition to designing  developing  and selling our own hdtvs  we will continue to seek selective oem customers for our projection displays 
we typically sell three displays and associated electronics for products in the projection market 
in the near to eye market  we sell either one or two displays and associated electronics 
the displays and electronics are sold together as a kit 
we also sell optical modules in the near to eye market 
the selling prices of these products range from between and  per unit 
cost of sales 
our gross margins are influenced by various factors  including manufacturing efficiencies  yields  and absorption issues  product mix  product differentiation  product uniqueness  inventory management  and volume pricing 
the manufacturing related issues have the most significant impact on our gross margins 
to date  our manufacturing capacity has exceeded our manufacturing volume  resulting in the inability to fully absorb the 
table of contents cost of our manufacturing infrastructure 
as a result  we expect it will be difficult to attain significant improvements in yields until we run higher volumes 
selling  general  and administrative expense 
selling  general  and administrative expense consists principally of administrative and selling costs  salaries  commissions  and benefits to personnel  and related facilities costs 
we make substantially all of our microdisplay sales directly to oems through a very small sales force that consists primarily of direct technical sales persons 
therefore  there is no material cost of distribution in our selling  general  and administrative expense 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists principally of salaries and benefits to scientists  engineers  and other technical personnel  related facilities costs  process development costs  and various expenses for projects  including new product development 
research and development expense continues to be very high as we continue to develop our lcos technology and manufacturing processes  and refine our hdtv products 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
during preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  fixed assets  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of a sale exists  that is  a product is shipped under an agreement with a customer  risk of loss and title has passed to the customer  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
sales allowances are estimated based upon historical experience of sales returns 
we recognize revenue related to design and engineering services depending on the relevant contractual terms 
under fixed price contracts that contain project milestones  revenue is recognized as milestones are met 
under contracts where revenue is recognized based on milestones  the fair value of milestones completed equals the fair value of work performed 
under a fixed price contract whereby we were paid based on performance of tasks  we recognized revenue based on the estimated percentage of completion of the entire project as measured by the costs for man hours and materials incurred to date compared to the total estimated costs for man hours and materials 
any anticipated losses on fixed price contracts are recorded in the period they are determinable 
all major design and engineering services projects for customers were complete at december   and such work is expected to be minimal in the future 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering a customer s financial condition  credit history  and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances could be required 
we write down our inventory for obsolete inventory 
we write down our inventory to estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 
financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely 
table of contents than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in our tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is required  we take into account all evidence with regard to the utilization of a deferred tax asset  including our past and projected operating results  the character and jurisdiction of such operating results  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect utilization of a deferred tax asset  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
deferred tax assets resulting from net operating losses and tax credits generated by our pre spin off operations were retained by tfs in accordance with applicable tax law 
in the near term  we do not expect to accrue for a tax benefit on any losses that we incur 
long term assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  intangibles  and other investments  are originally recorded at cost 
on an on going basis  we assess these assets to determine if their current recorded value is impaired 
when assessing these assets  we consider projected future cash flows to determine if impairment is applicable 
these cash flows are evaluated for objectivity by using weighted probability techniques and also comparisons of past performance against projections 
we may also identify and consider independent market values of assets that we believe are comparable 
if we were to believe that an asset s value was impaired  we would write down the carrying value of the identified asset and charge the impairment as an expense in the period in which the determination was made 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to long lived assets in accordance with this policy 
our historical financial statements prior to our spin off from tfs include those assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses directly attributable to our operations and allocations of certain tfs corporate expenses to us 
these amounts have been allocated to us on the basis that we consider to reflect most fairly or reasonably the utilization of the services provided to  or the benefits received by  us 
we believe the methods used to allocate these amounts are reasonable 
the financial information included herein for periods prior to the spin off is not necessarily indicative of our future financial position  results of operations  or cash flows nor is it necessarily indicative of what the financial position  results of operations  and cash flows would have been had we operated as a stand alone public entity during the periods covered 
our costs and expenses prior to our spin off from tfs include allocations from tfs for centralized legal  accounting  treasury  quality assurance  real estate  information technology  engineering  and other tfs corporate services and infrastructure costs 
these allocations have been determined on the basis that we and tfs considered to be reasonable reflections of the utilization of services provided to or the benefits received by us 
allocated costs included in our cost of sales totaled million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
allocated costs included in selling  general  and administrative expenses totaled million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
allocated costs included in our research and development expenses totaled  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the determination and basis of the amount of costs and expenses allocated to us varied depending on the situation 
legal  accounting  treasury  quality assurance  and other tfs corporate functions  including officers salaries  were allocated based on an estimation of time devoted to the microdisplay business for these functions 
facility costs and information technology services were allocated on the basis of headcount of the microdisplay business  which is most representative of utilization of these resources 
engineering services were allocated to us based on the actual hours of services used 
the allocation methodologies utilized represent management s best estimate of the actual services utilized by the microdisplay business 
our financial results subsequent to the spin off may differ materially from those recorded historically 
these potential differences are the result of several factors  including the following actual costs for services needed by our business may differ from amounts historically allocated to us from tfs  certain items  including facilities charges  that were recorded by the tfs combined entity as depreciation are now recorded as rent expense by us  for which we pay cash  and 
table of contents changes in the way we manage our business as a stand alone entity as opposed to a division may result in different business decisions 
since the spin off  the actual costs for services needed by our business have not differed materially from amounts historically allocated to us from tfs 
however  we are no longer part of a larger organization  therefore  certain expense items may increase more rapidly 
we and tfs have entered into a series of agreements to facilitate our separation from tfs 
these agreements include certain transitional services  leases  intellectual property transfers  and tax sharing agreements 
certain of these agreements require us to pay a negotiated fee 
if we are unable to build an infrastructure to provide these services internally  our operating results could be adversely affected 
because our business serves new and developing markets  is based on a relatively new technology  and is expected to be significantly influenced by the introduction of new hdtv products  accurately forecasting revenue for a particular future period is difficult 
to date  the majority of our product sales to customers have been for their use in designing their end products or for improving their production processes as opposed to volume production lots 
therefore  the amount of revenue recorded in any given period may fluctuate significantly  and predictable revenue trends have not yet developed 
while we anticipate that our revenue will increase  there can be no assurances that this will occur or when it will occur 
because a significant amount of our expenses are fixed in nature and we still experience low manufacturing volumes  we anticipate that the amount of revenue recognized during the first half of will not result in a material change to our cash consumption rate 
we do anticipate  however  that as we continue the move into volume production  we will continue to improve our manufacturing yields and more fully absorb our fixed costs  which will result in improved gross margins and results of operations 
however  as we continue to increase our revenue and shift our product mix predominantly to the hdtvs  we will use cash to finance increases in working capital 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales of certain items in our financial statements 
years ended december  net sales costs and expenses cost of sales selling  general  and administrative research and development impairment charge total costs and expenses operating loss investment income loss on investments loss before income taxes year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales were million in compared to million in the increase was due to a increase in product sales which was partially offset by a decrease in design and engineering services sales 
all major design and engineering services projects for customers were complete at year end  and such work is expected to be minimal in the future 
net sales in the projection market  which now includes the rptv market  were million or of sales  in compared to million or of sales in the remaining sales were in the near to eye market 

table of contents net sales in north america totaled million  or of net sales  in compared to million  or of net sales  in net sales in asia totaled  or of net sales  in compared to  or of net sales  in net sales in europe totaled  or of net sales  in compared to  or of net sales  in cost of sales 
total cost of sales was million  or of net sales  in compared to million  or of net sales  in cost of product sales was million  or of product sales  in compared to million or of product sales in the increase in the cost of product sales was mainly due to the start of production of rptvs which resulted in overall increases in personnel  outside services  outside contractor costs  freight  duty  and expediting 
additionally  inventory write offs were million in compared to  in the large negative gross margin in each year resulted primarily from the low volume of shipments and low manufacturing yields in the shipped products 
to date  our manufacturing capacity has exceeded our manufacturing volume  resulting in the inability to fully absorb the cost of our manufacturing infrastructure 
cost of sales for design and engineering services decreased to  in from  in due to the decrease in design and engineering services provided to customers 
as is typical in most segments of the high technology industry  we anticipate downward pressure on the prices of our products 
a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are fixed in nature and consist of items such as utilities  depreciation  and amortization 
the amount of these costs do not vary period to period based on the number of units produced nor can the amounts of these costs be adjusted in the short term 
therefore  in periods of lower production volume  these fixed costs are absorbed by a lower number of units  thus increasing the cost per unit 
as a result  we expect it will be difficult to attain significant improvements in gross margins until we operate at higher production volumes 
selling  general  and administrative expense 
selling  general  and administrative expense totaled million in compared to million in in  selling  general  and administrative expense included approximately million in spin off costs  and a charge of  related to our guarantee of the financial obligations of  and the write off of a note receivable from  voiceviewer  inc after adjusting for the spin off costs and the voiceviewer guarantee  selling  general  and administrative expense increased by approximately  in most of that increase was due to an increase of approximately  in sales and marketing expense  and an increase of approximately  in human resources department expenses 
the increase in sales and marketing costs reflected increased personnel costs  outside services  and trade show expense related primarily to hdtv products 
human resources costs in were actual stand alone costs as compared to when many of the costs were allocated from tfs 
allocated costs from tfs benefited from fixed costs of the tfs human resources department being spread over more employees 
research and development expense 
research and development expense was million in compared to million in the increase was mainly due to increased engineering personnel costs and development costs of our first hdtv product 
impairment charge 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million 
of this amount  million related to an impairment of long lived assets  million related to the discontinuance of an expansion card and hdtv tuner development project  and  related to the write off of costs incurred to file and process patent filings which we have determined not to pursue further 
benefit from income taxes 
we recorded no benefit from income taxes in we do not expect to record a deferred tax asset for the tax benefit on any losses that we may incur until we believe it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized 
in  in connection with the formation and spin off of our company by tfs  we assumed a net deferred tax liability of million 
this net deferred tax liability was the result of differences between the book and tax basis of the assets transferred to us 
tfs retained the net operating losses and tax credits that were generated by our operations before the spin off 
the assumption of the net deferred tax liability resulted in a corresponding reduction in the tfs net investment contributed to us in pursuant to sfas no 
 the assumption of the net deferred tax liability enabled us to record additional deferred tax assets of approximately million during the period from the spin off date to december  a valuation allowance has been recorded for deferred tax assets generated during the period ended december  that exceeded our net deferred tax liabilities 

table of contents net loss 
we recorded a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales increased to million in compared to million in this increase in total net sales was due primarily to an increase in net product sales of to million in from  in this increase in net product sales was partially offset by a decline in design and engineering services to  in from  in revenue from design and engineering services decreased as we completed certain contracts

cost of sales was million  or of net sales  in compared to million  or of net sales  in the decrease  in absolute dollars  was the result of decreased inventory write offs as well as cost reduction efforts that resulted in lower headcount and  therefore  lower personnel costs of  in  we had inventory write offs of approximately  compared to million in when we wrote off inventory in connection with the termination of our relationship with rca thompson 
the large negative gross margin in each year resulted primarily from the low volume of shipments and low manufacturing yields in the shipped products 
to date  our manufacturing capacity has exceeded our manufacturing volume  resulting in the inability to fully absorb the cost of our manufacturing infrastructure

research and development expense 
research and development expense was million in compared to million in through the third quarter of  all of our research and development expense related to ongoing efforts to develop lcos microdisplay products as well as our continued development of the manufacturing process for lcos microdisplays 
in the fourth quarter of  we incurred expenses of approximately  associated with the development of our first hdtv product 
the overall decrease in research and development expense in was a result of cost reduction efforts in late that resulted in lower headcount and  therefore  lower personnel costs in comparison to benefit from income taxes 
in connection with the formation and spin off of our company by tfs  we assumed a net deferred tax liability of million 
this net deferred tax liability is the result of differences between the book and tax basis of the assets transferred to us

because our new products  particularly our hdtv products  are focused more on the consumer markets  we expect to experience seasonality in our revenue and cost of sales 
we anticipate that these seasonal trends will reflect consumers patterns of increasing purchases during the year end holiday period 
we have experienced negative gross margins in each quarter as a result of the low volume of shipments and low manufacturing yields in the shipped products

net cash used in operating activities was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
at december   we had million of working capital  including cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of million 
the successful introduction of an hdtv product to market and securing volume orders from consumer electronics retailers for htdvs represent a key ingredient in our success 
in the second quarter of  we signed a supply agreement to provide hdtvs to sears roebuck and company 
in the third quarter of  we began shipping hdtvs to sears 
also in the third quarter of  our supplier of light engines  a major sub assembly of the hdtv  informed us that they were unable to supply us with the volume of light engines necessary to satisfy our requirements and granted us a temporary license to build light engines 
as a result of our not being able to supply the required number of hdtvs  sears exercised their option to terminate the supply agreement 
in the fourth quarter of  our light engine supplier informed us that they would not be able to manufacture the light engine in volume until the second quarter of  and granted us a temporary license to build light engines 
in march of  we received authorization from our light engine supplier to have the light engine manufactured on our behalf by a third party manufacturer and granted us a perpetual license to the light engine technology 
we are currently evaluating potential contract manufacturers for the purpose of making light engines 
we currently believe that we will not have light engines supplied in volume until the second half of we are currently manufacturing a limited quantity of light engines in our manufacturing facility in tempe  arizona 
this will allow us to manufacture a limited number of hdtvs and support low volume customers until we can obtain a high volume supply of light engines 
until we obtain a high volume supply of light engines  we will not be able to manufacture and sell a sufficient number of hdtvs to achieve positive cash flow or profitability 
as a result of this situation  we believe that our cash balances on december  will not be sufficient to finance our operations through  and that we will need to obtain debt or additional equity financing 
we are actively pursuing additional capital  but we currently have no commitments or understandings regarding any additional funding with any person or firm 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain any necessary financing on satisfactory terms  or at all 
we believe that obtaining orders from customers and announcing progress towards obtaining a high volume supply of light engines will increase our ability to raise debt or additional equity financing 

table of contents aggregate contractual obligations the following table lists our commercial commitments amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts less years other commercial commitments committed than year years years and over in thousands facilities leases development  maintenance and minimum royalty agreements purchase orders purchase agreement guarantee we have contractual commitments for property leases for our tempe headquarters and for our development center in boulder  colorado 
in addition  we have contractual commitments for development  software maintenance  and minimum royalties related to the development and production of our hdtv products 
we have issued purchase orders to vendors for the purchase of materials totaling approximately million 
in addition  we have a million purchase agreement with jds uniphase 
if we are not able to resume production of our hdtvs  much of this material will be in excess of our requirements 
in such case  if we are unable to cancel or otherwise restructure these purchase commitments  any materials purchased in excess of our requirements will be written off as excess inventory 
the guarantee relates to our guarantee in connection with a small business administration loan to voiceviewer technology  inc  a private company developing microdisplay products 
voiceviewer is unable to meet its current obligations under the loan agreement 
we and the other guarantors are making payments as they become due 
we have determined that it is probable that voiceviewer will be unable to meet its future obligations under the loan agreement 
therefore  we have accrued  which represents our maximum obligation under the guarantee amount 
we have a security interest in  and second rights to  the intellectual property of voiceviewer  while the lending institution has the first rights 
however  we do not believe we can realize any significant value from voiceviewer s intellectual property 
under the tax sharing agreement  we have agreed to indemnify tfs against any taxes  other than separation taxes  that are attributable to us since our formation  even while we were a member of tfs federal consolidated tax group 
tfs has agreed to indemnify us against any taxes  other than separation taxes  that are attributable to the businesses retained by tfs 
the tax sharing agreement sets forth rules for determining taxes attributable to us and taxes attributable to the businesses retained by tfs 
pursuant to the tax sharing agreement  we have agreed not to take any action that would cause the spin off not to qualify under section of the internal revenue code 
we have agreed not to take certain actions for two years following the spin off  unless we obtain an irs ruling or an opinion of counsel to the effect that these actions will not affect the tax free nature of the spin off 
these actions include certain issuances of our stock  a liquidation or merger of our company  and dispositions of assets outside the ordinary course of our business 
if any of these transactions were to occur  the spin off could be deemed to be a taxable distribution to tfs 
this would subject tfs to a substantial tax liability 
this offering is not prohibited by our agreement with tfs to refrain from certain issuances of our stock 
we have agreed to indemnify tfs and its affiliates to the extent that any action we take or fail to take gives rise to a tax incurred by tfs or any of its affiliates with respect to the spin off 
in addition  we have agreed to indemnify tfs for any tax resulting from an acquisition by one or more persons of a or greater interest in our company 
we have no debt 
in addition  we have no capital lease obligations  unconditional purchase obligations  other long term obligations  or any other commercial commitments except as noted above

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments at december   we did not participate in any derivative financial instruments  or other financial or commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under sfas no 
we hold no investment securities that would require disclosure of market risk 
primary market risk exposures our primary market risk exposures are in the areas of foreign currency exchange rate risk 
foreign currency devaluations  especially in asian currencies  such as the japanese yen  the korean won  and the taiwanese dollar  may cause a foreign competitor s products to be priced significantly lower than our products 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our cost of goods and operating margins 
in addition  currency devaluation can result in a loss to us if we hold deposits of that currency 
hedging foreign currencies can be difficult  especially if the currency is not freely traded 
we have not attempted to hedge or otherwise mitigate this risk because our exposure to any given currency is nominal 
a change in the currency exchange rate of in any given currency would not have a material impact on our results of operations 
if  in the future  our exposure to a given currency increases  we would contemplate hedging at that time 
based on the foregoing  we cannot provide assurance that fluctuations and currency exchange rates in the future will not have an adverse effect on our operations
