revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when the following four basic criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
reagent sales revenue from the sale of the company s reagents in the us market is recognized upon shipment when both title and risk of loss transfer to the customer upon shipment 
revenue from the sale of the company s reagents in the export market is recognized fob customs clearance when both title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
human collagen and collagen by product sales revenue from the sale of the company s human collagen product and from the sale of by products of collagen is recognized upon shipment and either passage of a day inspection period or  for by products of collagen  passage of a day inspection period or upon receipt of notification of customer acceptance 
in accordance with a revenue sharing agreement between the company and the company s human collagen customer  revenue from the sale of by products is allocated to the company and to the collagen customer 
medical instrument sales revenue from the sale of the company s medical instruments is generally recognized upon shipment and completion of contractual obligations relating to training and or installation based on terms of the related agreements 
revenue from rentals of the company s medical instruments is recognized over the life of the rental agreement 
instrument service contract revenue is recognized over the life of the contract 
the company recognizes revenue on the sale of medical instruments in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  for agreements entered into beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year the company s medical instrument sales contracts involve multiple deliverables  including the sale or rental of an instrument including training  the subsequent servicing of the instrument during the first year  reagent products provided to the customer during the validation period and  in some cases  price guarantees for consumables purchased during the immucor  inc 
annual report contract period and or a software interface to be provided to the customer 
the company has determined the fair value of certain of these elements  such as training  validation reagents  and first year service 
the portion of the instrument sales price applicable to the instrument itself is recognized upon shipment and completion of contractual obligations relating to training and or installation based on the terms of the related agreement 
if the agreement does not include any price guarantees  the sales price in excess of the fair values of training  validation reagents  and service is allocated to the instrument itself 
the fair value of at least one customer training session is recognized as revenue when the instrument itself is recognized  provided that the training has been provided 
if multiple sessions are contractually provided for  and not all training has been complete at the time the instrument is recognized  additional training revenue is recognized upon delivery 
the fair value of reagent products provided to the customer during the validation period is also recognized when the instrument itself is recognized 
the fair value of first year service is deferred and recognized over the first year of the contract 
the company believes it not possible to determine the fair value of price guarantees 
if the agreement contains price guarantees  the entire sales price is deferred and recognized over the guarantee period 
the allocation of the total consideration received based on the estimated fair value of the units of accounting requires judgment by management 
in certain limited situations involving third party leasing arrangements  the company enters into a repurchase agreement whereby if the ultimate customer terminates the lease  the company agrees to repurchase the instrument for an amount equal to the remaining unpaid lease payments owed to the third party leasing company 
in these limited situations  the company continues to defer the revenue related to the sale and subsequently recognizes the revenue over the lease term as the lease payments are made to the third party leasing company and it is clear that the ultimate customer has not terminated the related lease 
in prior periods  the company also deferred the corresponding cost of these instrument sales and recognized the costs over the same period as the related revenue 
during the fiscal quarter ended february   the company determined that it was more appropriate to recognize the instrument costs in these deferral situations when the instrument has been installed and written acceptance has been received from the customer 
accordingly  during the fiscal quarter ended february   the company recorded additional cost of sales totaling approximately  which was related to prior quarters but which was not material to any single quarter 
the company now records all instrument costs at the time the instrument is installed and accepted by the customer and title has legally transferred to the customer 
sales subject to a plan of factoring sales subject to a plan of factoring are recorded at their net realizable value defined as gross sales less the annual estimated cost of factoring the sale 
should the factored sale remain uncollected by the factor at the end of one year  an estimate of the additional factoring discount is made and recorded monthly as an additional reduction of sales revenue 
shipping and handling charges the amounts charged customers for shipping and handling of orders are classified as revenue and reported as invoiced in the statement of operations as net sales 
allowance for doubtful accounts immucor maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company s current policy for its north american affiliates  based on historical collection experience  is to provide an allowance of of domestic third party gross receivables and an allowance of of international third party gross receivables 
the company s current policy for all other affiliates  based on historical collection experience  is to provide an allowance of of all third party gross receivables 
in addition  any third party invoices over three years old are also provided for in the allowance 
at may   the allowance is approximately of the gross accounts receivable balance 
the company continually monitors the collectibility of its customer accounts and when indications arise that an amount is not likely to be collected  the amount is charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of any of immucor s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of first in  first out cost or market 
cost includes material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
the company uses a standard cost system as a tool to monitor production efficiency 
the standard cost system applies estimated labor and manufacturing overhead factors to inventory based on budgeted production and efficiency levels  staffing levels and costs of operation  based on the experience and judgment of management 
actual costs and production levels may vary from the standard established and are charged to the consolidated statement of income as a component of cost of sales 
since us generally accepted accounting principles require that the standard cost approximate actual cost  periodic adjustments are necessary 
the provision for obsolete and or excess inventory is reviewed on a quarterly basis 
all finished good reagent products which will expire in less than six months are reserved in the period in which this expiration threshold is met 
any raw  intermediate  or finished product that has been quarantined because it has failed quality control qc is reserved in the period in which the product fails qc testing 
should the product be successfully reworked results and pass final quality control checks  it is then valued at its standard cost 
obsolete and quarantined inventory is physically segregated from useable and saleable inventory and destroyed according to regulatory and fiscal guidelines 
no material changes have been made to the inventory policy during fiscal excess of cost over net assets acquired and other long lived assets in assessing the recoverability of the company s excess of cost over net assets acquired and other long lived assets  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded for these assets 
on june   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and is required to analyze its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
on june   the company also adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this sfas supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  however it retains the fundamental provisions of that statement related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used 
income taxes our income tax policy records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
the company follows very specific and detailed guidelines regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any allowances as required 
the company believes that the value of the company s deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statements of income 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  carry back opportunities  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly 
no material changes have been made to the income tax policy during fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements 
stock based employee compensation the company currently accounts for stock option grants in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and accordingly does not recognize compensation expense for the stock option grants 
the company grants stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of the grant 
beginning in fiscal  the company began awarding grants to eligible new hires with the respective exercise price equal to the closing price on the business day immediately prior to the grant date  therefore in these cases  the exercise price may be higher or lower than the fair value of the shares at the date of grant 
management has determined that the aggregate difference between the grant date fair values and the exercise prices for grants awarded to new hires is not material  and accordingly has not included any such compensation cost related to these grants in the company s results of operations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the company adopted the interim disclosure requirements in the period ended may  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of income based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the new standard was to be effective for public entities excluding small business issuers in the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  however  as a result of complex implementation issues raised by numerous registrants and their independent registered public accounting firms  the securities and exchange commission announced in april a phase in implementation process  requiring implementation in the first annual reporting period beginning after june  see note to the consolidated financial statements for pro forma disclosure of this new standard s effect on the company s net income and earnings per share calculations for each of the three immucor  inc 
annual report fiscal years ended in the period ended may  actual results in future years may differ from the pro forma results reflected in note due to an increase or decrease in grants of employee stock options and or changes in assumptions  such as the use of estimated versus actual forfeitures or a change in expected life 
overview the company s overall strategy in fiscal was to continue to improve gross margin gross profit as a percentage of sales 
in this effort  the company was successful  as gross margin increased to for the year ended may  from for the year ended may  as further discussed below under results of operations  the improvement in gross margin during the year ended may   as compared to the prior year period  was due to several factors  including reagent price increases  attributable in part to the cancellation of supply agreements with two group purchasing organizations in january in order to increase member purchasing prices as well as reduce administrative fees associated with these contracts  increased capture revenues  driven by the placement of additional instruments which require use of this technology  increased human collagen revenues  due primarily to the fact that the first shipment of this product did not occur until may  but also due in part to fiscal sales of nouricel a by product of human collagen  and increased manufacturing efficiencies due in part to the elimination of a number of redundant products currently manufactured at the company s three manufacturing facilities during the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal and the consolidation of the company s red cell product manufacturing  previously produced at both the norcross and houston facilities  to the company s norcross facility  completed at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal the company s goal of improving gross margin in fiscal was somewhat hindered by the application of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the accounting treatment mandated by this pronouncement resulted in a reduction of fiscal revenues of million  which will be recognized as additional revenue in future periods 
this revenue reduction adversely impacted gross margin as the costs associated with these deferred revenues were not deferred  as accounting guidance prohibits such cost deferral 
for fiscal  the company is continuing to focus on improving gross margin through achieving continued benefits from strategies already implemented prior to may   as well as through the implementation of new strategies 
listed below are the key factors which the company expects to drive further gross margin improvement in fiscal implementation of customer loyalty program this new program has been built upon the standardized tier pricing structure first implemented in fiscal as with the structure implemented in fiscal  there are three pricing tiers each representing differing levels of customer loyalty  with the highest tier consisting of the lowest prices for an automated instrument customer and the lowest tier consisting of the highest prices for the non committed  occasional customer 
the new program  which was implemented in august  is intended to promote higher sales volumes while partially shielding the company s more loyal customers from the effects of price increases 
impact of galileo increased market penetration the company expects capture revenues to continue to increase in fiscal over fiscal  due to the continued impact of fiscal galileo placements as well as expected new placements in fiscal in addition  service revenue is expected to continue to increase as the service warranty periods for prior year galileo placements expire and additional service contracts are purchased by customers 
as of may   the company has placed galileo instruments with european customers since introducing the galileo to the european market in the first quarter of fiscal additionally    and galileo instruments  respectively  have been placed as of may  in the us market since fda clearance was received in april  in the canadian market since health canada clearance was received in july  and in the japanese market since ministry of health clearance was received in july increased japanese market penetration on april   the company announced that it had entered into discussions with kainos laboratories  inc  the distributor of immucor products in japan  about the possibility of structuring kainos blood banking business as a joint venture between immucor and kainos 
the agreement to form the joint venture was announced by the company on june  the transaction was fully consummated on july   with immucor and kainos owning and  respectively  of immucor kainos  inc the newly formed joint venture company that is now immucor s distributor in japan 
immucor paid kainos approximately million for its initial interest in the joint venture company  and will buy the remaining interest at a later date for approximately the same price 
kainos has agreed to provide certain services to the joint venture company 
the company believes the formation of this joint venture is a key step towards further penetrating the japanese transfusion diagnostics market  the third largest such market in the world after europe and the united states 
results implementation of new kiwi technology in july  the company signed a technology licensing agreement with kiwi ingenuity limited kiwi  a partner to auckland university of technology biotechnology research institute to use kiwi s kode technology platform to create a quality control system for blood group typing 
this technology allows for the attachment of molecules on to the outside of cells  thereby resulting in a quality control system for blood grouping 
the company expects to begin using this new technology in manufacturing products beginning in late fiscal  and expects that offering its customers heightened assurance as to the accuracy of test results will provide the company with a competitive advantage  thereby increasing overall revenues 
the company expects to spend approximately  in research and development costs regarding this agreement in fiscal increased manufacturing efficiencies the company expects to continue the process of eliminating redundant products currently manufactured at the company s three manufacturing facilities 
additionally  the company expects to continue increasing manufacturing efficiencies going into fiscal through implementation of a manufacturing execution system mes  a new sales forecasting system  and a new marketing database  the combination of which is expected to drive more accurate forecasting of product demand and resulting material and labor requirements 
the new marketing database was implemented in june the new sales forecasting system is expected to be implemented in january mes is expected to be implemented in the first quarter of fiscal in addition to the above strategies  the company expects to further improve its competitive position going into fiscal through the launch of its third generation automated assay instrument  which is expected to be released in the european market in the summer of at the american association for clinical chemistry convention held in july  the company presented a prototype of its new third generation instrument  the galileo echo 
development of this instrument has further progressed during fiscal with the company accepting the manufacturer s engineering model in late fiscal the galileo echo is expected to be significantly smaller and faster than the abs  and have substantially all of the features of the company s larger galileo product  apart from lower throughput 
the company believes the new instrument will appeal to the small to medium sized hospital market  the largest segment of its customers which number approximately  to  worldwide  to which the company s abs instrument is currently marketed 
the cost of development totaled million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and is expected to total approximately million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources as of may   the company s cash and cash equivalents balance totaled million  an increase of million over fiscal and million over fiscal these increases were driven by higher net cash provided by operating activities resulting primarily from higher net income 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately million  million  and million for the fiscal years  and  respectively 
as outlined in the chart below  management continued to work diligently to reduce the days sales in accounts receivable 
some of the company s foreign subsidiaries have historically slower collection rates due to their respective economic environments 
the company has been successful with the factoring of italian accounts receivable that continues to improve the italian subsidiary s financial position 
the company has made a improvement in days sales in receivables over the past two years 
the company has also experienced a improvement in days sales in inventory over the last two years 
improvements in inventory management through product consolidation and production planning have been partially offset by the million increase in instruments in inventory from the addition of the galileo to the product line 
days sales in receivables days sales in inventory for the year ended may   million of cash was used in investing activities consisting primarily of capital expenditures totaling million and investments in marketable debt securities totaling million  partially offset by million in proceeds from the november sale of the company s long term investment in lionheart technologies  inc the sale of this investment resulted in a gain of million which is included in the consolidated statement of income caption  other expense income  net for the year ended may  the million in capital expenditures for the year ended may  consisted primarily of million for galileo and other instruments used for demonstration purposes by the sales force or placed at customer sites on reagent rental agreements to be depreciated over the life of the respective agreements  million for machinery and equipment upgrades for use primarily at the company s norcross facility  and million for computer hardware and software enhancements of the enterprise software system

the term loan and the revolver bear interest of libor plus additional percentage points ranging from to  or suntrust bank prime rate plus additional percentage points ranging from to based on certain calculations as defined in the loan agreement 
the loans are collateralized by the capital stock of all of the company s subsidiaries 
the company recorded a non cash  pre tax charge of  in the third quarter of fiscal to write off unamortized deferred financing charges related to its previous credit facility 
as of may   there was million outstanding on the term loan and none outstanding on the revolver 
net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately million 
the majority of the usage of cash for the current year period is attributable to million in stock repurchases  as described more fully below  and to million in principal payments on the term loan with suntrust bank

as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company initiated in october an internal investigation into certain events involving its italian subsidiary 
the internal investigation also addressed the underpayment of value added tax vat by our italian subsidiary 
all due but unpaid vat has now been paid  with required interest  although the italian tax authorities may impose a penalty for underpayment of vat 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
as of may   the company had incurred approximately million in professional fees associated with the italian investigation discussed above 
of this amount  million was unpaid and included in other accrued liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheet as of may  the company believes it may incur up to an additional million in fiscal in professional fees and or other costs related to this investigation 
as discussed more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  no determination can yet be made as to whether the company  in connection with the circumstances surrounding the italian investigation  will become subject to any fines  penalties and or other charges imposed by any governmental authority  or any other damages or costs that may arise in connection with these circumstances 
accordingly  no provisions for any liabilities that may result upon closure of this matter have been made in the accompanying financial statements  other than the million discussed above 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we are aware of seven class action lawsuits having been filed in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia against the company and certain of our current and former directors and officers with respect to alleged violations of the securities laws 
all of the actions essentially duplicate one another  pleading essentially the same allegations 
the complaints filed in the lawsuits allege violations of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of and rule b promulgated thereunder  specifically alleging  among other things  that we misrepresented that our financial statements and disclosures during portions of the calendar year fairly and accurately reflected our results of operations  which allegedly resulted in the purchase of our common stock at artificially inflated market prices 
the lawsuits seek compensatory and other damages  and costs and expenses associated with the litigation 
we believe that each of the lawsuits is without merit  and intend to defend each of these lawsuits vigorously 
while we do not currently expect these matters to materially affect our financial condition or results of operations  there can be no assurance of any particular outcome 
results on april   the company announced that it had signed a letter of intent to engage in discussions with kainos laboratories  inc kainos  the distributor of immucor products in japan  about the possibility of structuring kainos blood banking business as a joint venture between immucor and kainos 
a definitive agreement to form the joint venture was signed  and announced by the company  on june  on june   kainos accordingly spun off its blood banking business  consisting primarily of certain assets and no debt  as a separate legal entity 
on july   final documents were signed fully consummating the joint venture arrangement  with immucor and kainos owning and  respectively  of immucor kainos  inc the newly formed joint venture company that is now immucor s distributor in japan 
for its initial interest  immucor paid kainos million japanese yen which equated to million us dollars 
the joint venture has shares of common stock authorized  of which shares were issued upon establishment  immucor purchased of these shares from kainos on july  the company is currently evaluating whether this joint venture will meet the definition of a variable interest entity as defined in the financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
fin no 

however  the company has determined that it will be the primary beneficiary  therefore regardless of whether the joint venture is deemed to be a variable interest entity  the transaction is expected to be accounted for as a purchase of a majority owned business  the results of operations of which will be included in the company s consolidated financial statements as of the date of acquisition 
pro forma results of operations for the year ended may  would not have been materially different as a result of this acquisition and therefore are not presented 
the company is awaiting additional information concerning certain asset valuations  primarily the value of the new distribution agreement see further discussion below  for purposes of finalizing the allocation of the purchase price 
in accordance with the terms of the stock purchase agreement associated with the above acquisition  immucor will purchase the remaining interest from kainos for million japanese yen 
the company expects to purchase this remaining interest after a three year transition period ending on june   but upon mutual agreement with kainos  may purchase the interest prior to the end of the transition period 
in accordance with the terms of a services agreement  kainos has agreed to supply certain services to the joint venture during the transition period 
the acquisition price  which will total million japanese yen upon immucor s purchase of kainos interest  includes a premium based on management s belief that this business will achieve higher future profitability levels with the installment of immucor personnel in key managerial positions overseeing the operations of the joint venture 
revenues from the date of acquisition through may  are expected to approach million 
in accordance with the terms of the joint venture agreement  immucor has agreed to fund the joint venture s purchase of kainos blood banking inventory  the majority of which consists of immucor products 
this inventory repurchase is expected to occur by the end of the second quarter of fiscal additionally  a new distribution agreement was signed on july  between immucor  kainos and the joint venture 
the new agreement stipulates that kainos will act as an intermediary between immucor and the joint venture in that kainos will have exclusive rights to supply the joint venture with immucor product during the term of the agreement 
in accordance with this agreement  the joint venture guarantees that kainos will receive a minimum net profit as defined in the agreement of million japanese yen by the end of the three year transition period ending june  on sales of immucor product to the joint venture 
the agreement expires on may   but may be terminated sooner upon mutual agreement of the parties  at the end of the transition period  or upon kainos realization of the minimum guaranteed net profit 
management continues to focus on reducing the leverage on the company s balance sheet and does not anticipate that there will be a need for additional borrowings

annual report repurchase obligations instruments in certain limited situations involving third party leasing arrangements  the company enters into a repurchase agreement whereby if the ultimate customer terminates the lease  the company agrees to repurchase the instrument for an amount equal to the remaining unpaid lease payments owed to the third party leasing company 
in these limited situations  the company continues to defer the revenue related to the sale and subsequently recognizes the revenue over the lease term as the lease payments are made to the third party leasing company and it is clear that the ultimate customer has not terminated the related lease 
in prior periods  the company also deferred the corresponding cost of these instrument sales and recognized the costs over the same period as the related revenue 
during the fiscal quarter ended february   the company determined that it was more appropriate to recognize the instrument costs in these deferral situations when the instrument has been installed and written acceptance has been received from the customer 
accordingly  during the fiscal quarter ended february   the company recorded additional cost of sales totaling approximately  which was related to prior quarters 
the company now records all instrument costs at the time the instrument is installed and accepted by the customer and title has legally transferred to the customer 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet financial arrangements as of may  results of operations for the fiscal year ended may   net sales totaled million  a million increase over the prior year 
net income was million  a million increase over the prior year 
diluted earnings per share totaled on million weighted average shares outstanding for fiscal  as compared to diluted earnings per share of on million weighted average shares outstanding for the prior year 
comparison of years ended may  and may  net sales reagent revenues grew to million compared to million in the prior year  a increase 
the growth in reagent revenues occurred as a result of traditional reagent price increases in north america  which contributed million to the increase  and volume and price increases in proprietary capture products 
capture product sales were million versus million in fiscal human collagen sales were million versus million in fiscal  as the first shipment of collagen did not occur until may sales of instruments were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal instrument revenues grew in part due to higher service contract revenue as a result of new placements under service contracts  as well as increases in service contract pricing 
gross margin the gross margin gross profit as a percentage of sales on traditional reagents for the year ended may  benefited from the price increases discussed above  increasing to for fiscal from for fiscal the benefit of the prices increases was partially offset by higher regulatory costs in the first quarter of fiscal to support ce marking in europe 
the gross margin on capture products was for fiscal  compared with for fiscal capture gross margin was favorably impacted by a changeover from selling the products in kits to selling the individual components an operational change which resulted in increases in both volume and price 
the gross margin on human collagen sales was for fiscal  compared with for fiscal this improvement was due in part to a fourth quarter fiscal adjustment totaling approximately  regarding previously invoiced shipments for which quantity discounts were not earned 
the gross margin on instruments  including the impact of the cost of providing service was a negative for fiscal  compared to a positive for fiscal as more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financials  in the quarter ended february  the company also changed how it was accounting for the costs of instruments under third party leasing arrangements and  as a result  recorded additional cost of sales of approximately  operating expenses research and development expenses were million for fiscal  million higher than those recorded in the prior fiscal year 
spending on the development of the new third generation instrument targeted for the small to medium sized hospital market the galileo echo was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
selling and marketing expenses increased million over the prior fiscal year  but decreased as a percentage of sales 
this decrease as a percentage of sales was due primarily to higher period over period sales as discussed more fully above 
distribution expenses for fiscal decreased by million from those recorded in the prior year period 
this reduction was due primarily to the consolidation of the houston facility shipping function into the norcross facility  a process which was begun during the fourth quarter of fiscal and completed in the first quarter of fiscal results general and administrative expenses in fiscal rose million over fiscal the increase was attributable primarily to higher legal fees due mainly to the italian investigation as discussed more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  as well as higher audit and tax fees  due in part to sarbanes oxley section internal control assessment 
amortization and other expenses for the year ended may  included a million charge related to improperly recorded transactions on the company s italian subsidiary s books

impact of recently issued accounting standards in november  the fasb issued statement no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 

sfas no 
amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb  chapter  previously stated that 


under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges 


sfas no 
requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this new standard is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  earlier application is permitted for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after november  the company is in the process of evaluating the impact sfas no 
will have upon adoption but does not anticipate it will have a significant impact on its financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions sfas no 

the amendments made by sfas no 
are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
previously  opinion required that the accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive asset should be based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished 
by focusing the exception on exchanges that lack commercial substance  the board believes sfas no 
produces financial reporting that more faithfully represents the economics of the transactions 
this statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the company does not believe the adoption of this new statement will have a material impact on its financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
r 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in statement however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of income based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an immucor  inc 
annual report alternative 
upon issuance  sfas r required public companies to apply the provisions of the statement in the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  in april  the securities and exchange commission approved a new rule that delays the effective date  requiring public companies to apply the statement in the first annual period beginning after june  except for the deferral of the effective date  the guidance in sfas r is unchanged 
we expect to adopt sfas r in our first interim period of fiscal using the modified retrospective method whereby prior period results are restated to reflect the impact of adoption of sfas r and have concluded that sfas r will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
the adoption of this statement should impact net income and earnings per share similar to the pro forma amounts disclosed for fiscal  and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
actual results in future years  however  may differ from the pro forma results reflected in note due to an increase or decrease in grants of employee stock options and or changes in assumptions  such as the use of estimated versus actual forfeitures or a change in expected life 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this interpretation clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
thus  the timing and or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
this interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
this interpretation is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  the company is in the process of evaluating the impact fin will have upon adoption but does not anticipate it will have a significant impact on its financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas no 
 which replaces accounting principles board opinions no 
accounting changes and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas no 
provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes retrospective application  or the latest practicable date  as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle and the reporting of a correction of an error 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on its financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could adversely impact its results of operations and financial condition 
to manage the volatility relating to these typical business exposures  the company may enter into various derivative transactions when appropriate 
the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk  primarily through its debt facility with its principle lender  which is subject to changes in libor rates 
the amount outstanding for this debt facility was million and million at may  and  respectively 
the company has utilized interest rate swap agreements with the objective of managing exposure to interest rate changes by effectively converting a portion of variable rate bank debt into fixed rates 
at may  and may   the company had an interest rate swap agreement in the company s functional currency  maturing in september  with an initial notional principal amount of million that amortizes over the life of the instrument 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement represents the estimated receipts or payments that would be made to terminate the agreement 
the liability to terminate the agreement in the company s functional currency was  and is included in other accrued liabilities at may   the liability was  and is included in other liabilities at may  based on the company s results for fiscal and debt balance outstanding at may   a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates would impact annual pre tax earnings by million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency 
operating income generated outside the united states as a percentage of total operating income was in  in and in fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  principally with the us dollar versus the euro  could impact operating results when translations of the company s subsidiaries financial statements are made in accordance with current accounting guidelines 
it has not been the company s practice to actively hedge its foreign subsidiaries assets or liabilities denominated in local currency 
most of the foreign currency exposures are managed locally by the company s foreign subsidiaries through the hedging of purchase commitments with the advance purchase of the required non functional currencies 
however  the company believes that over time weaknesses in one particular currency are offset by strengths in others 
in   and the company recorded net foreign currency transaction gains of approximately   and  respectively 
for fiscal  the fluctuation of the euro weighted average exchange rate increased net sales by approximately million 
a ten percent change in the year to date weighted average euro exchange rate would have had the effect of increasing or decreasing net sales by approximately million
