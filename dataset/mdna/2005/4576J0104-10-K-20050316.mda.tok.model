critical accounting policies we discuss below accounting policies that the company believes are critical to an investor s understanding of its financial results and condition  and require management to make complex judgments and or assessments of risks 
information regarding certain other accounting policies is included in the notes to the company s financial statements 
long lived assets 
hotels are depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue 

table of contents the company reviews its hotels on an annual basis for impairment or whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the value of the assets on our books may not be fully recoverable 
the company reviewed each of its hotels at december  for impairment and  based on its estimate of each hotel s future undiscounted cash flows  determined that no impairment existed at any of its hotels that were not held for sale 
in determining each hotel s future undiscounted cash flows  we made many assumptions and estimates  including the following annual cash flow growth rates for revenues and expenses  holdings periods of the hotels  expected remaining useful lives of the hotels  and fair value of the hotel upon disposition  if appropriate 
the company in the fourth quarter recorded an impairment charge on two of the three hotels that are held for sale at december  in the amount of million and in the fourth quarter recorded an additional impairment charges on two of the three hotels that are held for sale at december  in the amount of  the impairment charges on the three hotels that are held for sale at december  was based on valuing the hotels at the expected proceeds to be realized upon a sale less any closing costs 
if the company s estimate of the future cash flows of the hotels were to decrease in future periods  the company may be required to recognize further impairment charges in such periods and the impairment charges may be significant 
income taxes 
the trss have cumulative future income tax deductions of  at december  and the gross deferred tax asset associated with these future tax deductions was  the trss have recorded a valuation allowance equal to of the gross deferred tax asset due to the uncertainty of realizing the benefit of this asset 
the trss considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event the trss were to determine that it could realize all or a portion of the deferred tax asset in the future  the trss would record a reduction in the valuation allowance and recognize a deferred income tax benefit in the same amount

capital expenditures the percentage leases with the trss generally require the company to make available an amount equal to or of room revenues from the hotels  per month on a cumulative basis  for the periodic replacement or refurbishment of furniture  fixtures and equipment and certain other capital expenditures at the hotels 
each of the company s term loans require that the company make available for such purposes  at the hotels collateralizing those loans  amounts up to of gross revenues from such hotels 
the company intends to cause the expenditure of amounts in excess of such obligated amounts  if necessary  to comply with the reasonable requirements of any franchise agreement and otherwise to the extent that the company deems such expenditures to be in the best interests of the company 
see business narrative description of business internal growth strategy capital improvements  renovation and refurbishment above 
management believes that the amounts required to be made available by the company under the percentage leases will be sufficient to meet most of the routine expenditures for furniture  fixtures and equipment at the hotels 
however  in the past  the company has spent substantially more on capital expenditures than the percentage leases require 
management believed these additional expenditures were necessary to meet competitive pressures from other hotels  many of which are newly constructed 
in many cases  the expenditures were also required by franchisors of the hotels 
management believes that for the foreseeable future the company will continue to spend substantially more on capital expenditures than it is required to make available to the trss under the percentage leases or loan agreements 
the extent to which the actual expenditures exceed the amounts required to be made available will vary from year to year  based on a number of factors 
those factors include  for any given year  market and franchisor requirements  the point in the normal recurring upgrade cycle the hotels are at in that year  and the revenue of the hotels for that year 
in  management expects to spend approximately million on capital expenditures 
to the extent that the company spends more on capital expenditures than is available from the company s operations  the company intends to fund capital expenditures with available cash and borrowings under the line of credit

with respect to of the hotels  if the company were to sell those hotels in taxable transactions  the company would become liable for certain tax liabilities incurred by unit holders who exchanged interests in those hotels for units in the partnership when the company acquired the hotels 
the tax reimbursement liability with respect to a hotel is generally limited to a period within years of the hotel s acquisition date 
however  we cannot predict whether  when or to what extent the company may incur liability under these indemnifications 
see note to the company s financial statements beginning of page f seasonality of hotel business the hotel industry is seasonal in nature 
historically  the hotels operations have generally reflected higher occupancy rates and adr during the second and third quarters 
to the extent that cash flow for a quarter is insufficient to fund all of the hotel operating expenses and distributions for such quarter due to seasonal and other factors  the company may fund quarterly hotel operating expenses and distributions with available cash and borrowings under the line of credit 
inflation operators of hotels  including the ih manager  generally possess the ability to adjust room rates quickly 
however  competitive pressures and other factors have limited and may in the future limit the ability of the ih manager to raise room rates in response to inflation 
there can be no assurance that recent modest inflation levels will not increase in future years or that the effects of inflation can be offset by raising hotel room rates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates on its line of credit and other debt 
at december   the company had total outstanding indebtedness of  the company s interest rate risk objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  the company manages its exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for a portion of its borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements 
the company may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or caps and treasury options or locks to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to effectively lock the interest rate on a portion of its variable rate debt 
currently  the company has no derivative financial instruments 
the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
approximately of the company s outstanding debt was subject to fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of at december  the company regularly reviews interest rate exposure on its outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
for debt obligations outstanding at december   the following table presents principal repayments and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates in thousands thereafter total fair value debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate a mortgage has a balance outstanding at december  of million with a stated interest rate of 
the fair value market interest rate for this mortgage is 
the adjustment to reflect a fair value market interest rate of is an increase to the mortgage balance outstanding of million 
the table incorporates only those exposures that existed as of december  and does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
as a result  the company s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the future period  prevailing interest rates  and the company s hedging strategies at that time 
there is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and the company s financing requirements 
the company s line of credit  has a an outstanding balance of  and matures in july all of our other debt matures in or thereafter
