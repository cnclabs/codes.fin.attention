item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive level overview carbo ceramics inc generates revenue through the sale of products and services to the oil and gas industry 
the company s principal business consists of manufacturing and selling ceramic proppant for use in the hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells 
the company s products and services help oil and gas producers increase production and recovery rates from their wells  thereby lowering overall reservoir development costs 
as a result  the company s business is dependent to a large extent on the level of drilling activity in the oil and gas industry worldwide 
however  the company has increased its revenues and income over an extended period and across various industry business cycles by increasing its share of the worldwide market for all types of proppant 
while the company s ceramic proppants are more expensive than alternative non ceramic proppants  the company has been able to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of its products to numerous operators of oil and gas wells through increased technical marketing activity 
the company believes its future prospects will benefit from both an expected increase in drilling activity worldwide and the desire of industry participants to lower their overall development costs 
recently  the company has expanded its operations outside the united states 
international revenues represented  and of total revenues  respectively  over the past three years 
in the company constructed a manufacturing plant in china  its first plant located outside the united states  and completed a second production line at the facility in that doubled that plant s capacity 
in  the company opened a sales office in moscow  russia and established distribution operations in this country 
the company also continues to evaluate the possibility of building a production facility in russia 
the company believes international operations will continue to represent an important role in its future growth 
revenue growth in recent years has been driven primarily by increases in sales volume 
because the company s products compete in part against lower cost alternatives  price increases for the company s products have been minimal in recent years and the company expects future growth will continue to be dependent on increasing sales volume 
as a result  the company initiated construction of significant new manufacturing capacity in to meet anticipated future demand 
the company s gross profit margins are principally impacted by manufacturing costs and the company s production levels as a percentage of its capacity 
while most direct production expenses have been relatively stable or predictable over time  natural gas  which is used in the production process  has varied from approximately to of total monthly direct production costs over the last three years due to the price volatility of this fuel source 
the company s practice had been to purchase its estimated annual natural gas requirement in the spring of each year 
however  beginning in  the company initiated a program to purchase its natural gas requirement at various times during the year  in order to average the cost and reduce exposure to short term spikes in commodity prices 
despite the efforts to reduce exposure to changes in natural gas prices  it is possible that  given the significant portion of manufacturing costs represented by this fuel  future changes in net income may not be proportionate to changes in revenue 
management believes that the addition of new manufacturing capacity will be critical to the company s ability to continue its long term growth in sales volume and revenue 
since  the company has more than doubled its production capacity and currently has under construction a second manufacturing plant in wilkinson county  georgia 
when complete  the new plant will add million pounds of production capacity per year  a increase over current production capacity 
while the company has operated near full capacity for much of this period  the addition of significant new capacity in the future could adversely impact gross profit and operating margins if the timing of this new capacity does not match increases in demand for the company s products 
as the company s sales volume has increased  and as the company has expanded in international markets  there has been an increase in activities and expenses related to marketing  distribution  research and development  and finance and administration 
as a result  selling  general and administrative expenses have increased as a percentage of revenue in recent years 
in the future  the company expects to continue to actively pursue new business opportunities by increasing marketing activities  improving and expanding its distribution capabilities  focusing on new product development  and increasing international activities 
the company expects that these activities will generate increased revenue and that selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue will not change significantly 
general business conditions the company s business is significantly impacted by the number of natural gas wells drilled in north america  where the majority of wells are hydraulically fractured 
in markets outside north america  sales of the company s products are less dependent on natural gas markets but are influenced by the overall level of drilling and hydraulic fracturing activity 
furthermore  because the decision to use ceramic proppant is based on comparing the cost of ceramic proppant to the future value derived from increased production rates  the company s business is influenced by the current and expected prices of natural gas and oil 
natural gas prices and drilling activity in the north american market have been highly variable over the past three years 
in  the average natural gas rig count declined by in the us and in canada compared to in  activity levels in north america rebounded and the company established new sales volume records in a number of regions including the us rocky mountains  canada and east texas 
in addition  the company experienced significant sales growth in overseas markets due to an increase in drilling and fracturing activity in europe and asia 
throughout  worldwide oil and natural gas prices and related drilling activity levels remained very strong 
as a result  the company experienced record demand for its products worldwide 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that  of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue is recognized when title passes to the customer upon delivery 
the company generates a significant portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to the petroleum pressure pumping industry 
in addition  the company generates a significant portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to three major customers  all of which are in the petroleum pressure pumping industry 
as of december   approximately of the balance in accounts receivable was attributable to those three customers 
as stated in note to the consolidated financial statements  credit losses historically have been insignificant and  except in circumstances in which management was aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filings  the company generally did not record a reserve for bad debts 
due to the company s growth and the increasing proportion of its international sales  beginning in the company established an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a percentage of sales and periodically evaluates the allowance based on a review of trade accounts receivable 
trade accounts receivable are periodically reviewed for collectibility based on customers past credit history and current financial condition  and the allowance is adjusted  if necessary 
if a prolonged economic downturn in the petroleum pressure pumping industry were to occur or  for some other reason  any of the company s primary customers were to experience significant adverse conditions  its estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be reduced by a material amount and its allowance for doubtful accounts could be increased by material amounts 
at december   the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
obsolete or unmarketable inventory historically has been insignificant and generally written off when identified 
assessing the ultimate realization of inventories requires judgments about future demand and market conditions  and management believes that current inventories are properly valued at cost 
accordingly  no reserve to write down inventories has been recorded 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes are provided for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this standard takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
this calculation requires the company to make certain estimates about its future operations 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws  as well as changes in the company s financial condition  could affect these estimates 
long lived assets  which include property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangibles  and other assets comprise a significant amount of the company s total assets 
the company makes judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives 
additionally  the carrying values of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable 
this requires the company to make long term forecasts of its future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
these forecasts require assumptions about demand for the company s products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
purchase accounting requires extensive use of estimates and judgments to allocate the cost of an acquired enterprise to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the cost of an acquired enterprise is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
if necessary  these estimates can be revised during an allocation period when information becomes available to further define and quantify the value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the allocation period does not exceed a period of one year from the date of acquisition 
to the extent additional information to refine the original allocation becomes available during the allocation period  the purchase price allocation would be adjusted accordingly 
should information become available after the allocation period  the effects would be reflected in operating results 
results of operations percent percent change change in thousands net income for the year ended december   the company achieved record net income of million  a increase compared to the year ended december  net income increased mainly due to record revenues and cost efficiencies gained from operating the company s manufacturing facilities at higher throughput rates during the record level of revenue generated in resulted from higher sales volume and a slight increase in the average selling price of the company s products 
these improvements were partially offset by the impact of higher costs for natural gas  higher selling  general and administrative expenses and a loss on the impairment or disposal of assets resulting primarily from the replacement of manufacturing equipment 
the company s net income for was higher than the previous year 
a strong north american natural gas market and increased demand for proppants in russia and china were the driving forces behind a significant increase in net income for the year 
the us natural gas rig count increased steadily throughout  ending the year above the year end rig count 
while activity in the traditionally strong ceramic proppant markets in south texas and the gulf of mexico remained relatively flat compared to  the company saw increasing demand in the rockies  canada and east texas 
in addition to increased revenues  improved operating efficiency in its manufacturing facilities contributed to the increase in net income 
individual components of operating results are discussed below 
revenues percent percent change change in thousands revenues revenues in of million were higher than proppant sales volume increased compared to  driven by a increase in international sales 
domestic shipments remained strong in with a increase over  but were constrained because the company s manufacturing facilities were operating at or near full capacity 
worldwide proppant sales volume of million pounds in established a new annual record  surpassing the record of million pounds 
international sales growth for included increases of in overseas shipments  in canada and in mexico 
the increase in overseas sales in was primarily attributable to increased demand for the company s products in russia 
sales in overseas markets in were aided by the mid year addition of a second production line at the company s luoyang  china plant 
international shipments accounted for of sales volume in compared to in the average selling price of per pound of ceramic proppant increased compared to in the higher average unit price was due to the impact of a price increase in july and an increase in the proportion of total sales generated from higher priced proppants 
revenues for include a record million from pinnacle compared to million for revenues in of million were higher than the increase was driven primarily by a increase in sales volume  with domestic sales volume up and international sales volume up 
worldwide sales volume of million pounds during established a new annual record 
sales volume in canada increased by and sales volume outside of north america increased by compared to significant increases in overseas sales volume occurred in russia and china 
the worldwide sales increase is largely attributable to a increase in the average worldwide rig count from to  the addition of the plant in luoyang  china  which commenced operations in january  and continued success with the company s technical marketing efforts 
the average selling price per pound of ceramic proppant for was compared to for the decline in average selling price was due to an increase in sales of lower priced  light weight ceramic proppant products 
revenues for also included a full year of pinnacle operations compared to only seven months in the company acquired pinnacle on may  and has consolidated its results since that date 
gross profit percent percent change change in thousands gross profit gross profit the company s cost of sales consists of manufacturing costs  packaging and transportation expenses associated with the delivery of the company s products to its customers and handling costs related to maintaining finished goods inventory and operating the company s remote stocking facilities 
variable manufacturing expenses include raw materials  labor  utilities and repair and maintenance supplies 
fixed manufacturing expenses include depreciation  property taxes on production facilities  insurance and factory overhead 
the company has included handling costs in cost of sales beginning january  handling costs  including labor and overhead to maintain finished goods inventory  costs of operating remote stocking facilities and depreciation on those facilities  were charged to selling  general and administrative expenses prior to january  because handling costs tend to vary directly with sales activity and can impact shipping costs  the company decided that handling costs would be better classified as cost of sales 
handling costs included in the and financial statements have been reclassified as cost of sales to conform to the presentation 
the reclassification had no impact on net income 
handling costs amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
gross profit increased by from to the company s gross profit margin improved to in compared to in improvement in the gross profit margin was primarily due to a slight increase in the average sales price of proppant and higher throughput at the company s manufacturing facilities 
manufacturing facilities operated at of capacity in compared to of capacity in the factors contributing to improvement in the gross profit margin were partially offset by the impact of higher fuel costs on the company s manufacturing costs 
gross profit increased by from to gross profit as a percentage of sales was in  compared to in the improvement in gross profit was the result of both a significant increase in sales volume as well as increases in sales of higher margin products 
improved efficiency in manufacturing and distribution operations contributed to the increase in gross profit margin 
manufacturing facilities operated at of capacity in versus of capacity in partially offsetting this improvement was the effect of higher natural gas cost on domestic manufacturing operations 
continued improvement in distribution performance resulted in lower freight cost to transport finished goods from plants to remote storage locations

other operating expenses totaled million in  resulting primarily from a million write off of the remaining book value of equipment replaced at the company s mcintyre  georgia production facility and million for the impairment of software developed by pinnacle technologies due to development of new versions of the software 
selling  general and administrative expenses and other operating expenses increased by million in versus and  as a percentage of sales  decreased from in to in the increase in total expenses was due to the consolidation of expenses of pinnacle technologies  inc for the full year in and increased spending related to marketing  business development and research activities  partially offset by a decrease in other nonrecurring operating expenses 
other nonrecurring operating expenses in totaled million  including a million write off for equipment disposed of during expansion of the mcintyre facility and million start up costs related to production expansions 
the decrease in sg a and other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to start up costs and a legal reserve incurred during  which represented of sales

income tax expense of million for the year ended december  increased over the year ended december  due to the increase in taxable income resulting from the company s improved performance 
the effective income tax rate of of pretax income increased slightly from in primarily due to a decrease in tax exempt interest income  partially offset by a reduction in the effective state income tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents as of december  totaled million compared to million at the beginning of the year 
the company generated cash of million from operations and realized proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock for exercises of employee stock options 
total capital expenditures for the year were million and cash dividends paid totaled million 
capital spending on major projects during included million toward the new manufacturing facility in wilkinson county  georgia that is expected to be completed at the end of  completion of a second production line at the company s luoyang  china facility and replacement of calciner equipment at the mcintyre facility 
the remainder of capital spending included various improvements at each of the company s manufacturing facilities  additions to increase the company s capacity for handling and storing finished goods  equipment for pinnacle s operations  lab equipment and various administrative projects 
the company believes that the relatively high prices for oil and natural gas in the current spot and futures markets will continue to spur drilling and fracturing activity worldwide in consequently  the company expects sales of its products and cash flow provided by operating activities to remain strong 
the company intends to continue operating all of its manufacturing facilities at or near full capacity throughout  but expects its ability to increase sales volume over to be limited by production capacity 
however  the company believes that growth opportunities for pinnacle technologies are favorable and revenues for that business in could grow to compared to the company s current intent  subject to its financial condition  the amount of funds generated from operations and the level of capital expenditures  is to continue to pay quarterly dividends to shareholders of its common stock 
on january   the company s board of directors approved the payment of a quarterly dividend of per share to shareholders of the company s common stock 
the company has total projected capital expenditures of million to million for  including spending of approximately million on a new manufacturing facility in wilkinson county  georgia 
the new georgia plant is designed to have initial annual capacity of million pounds at an expected total cost of approximately million 
the company began construction on the facility in october and the plant is on schedule for completion at the end of the company maintains an unsecured line of credit of million 
as of december   there was no outstanding debt under the credit agreement 
the company anticipates that cash on hand  cash provided by operating activities and funds available under its line of credit will be sufficient to meet planned operating expenses  tax obligations and capital expenditures for the next months 
the company also believes that it could acquire additional debt financing  if needed 
based on these assumptions  the company believes that its fixed costs could be met even with a moderate decrease in demand for the company s products 
off balance sheet arrangements the company had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations as of december  payments due in period less than more than total year years years years in thousands long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations primarily railroad equipment purchase obligations natural gas contracts raw materials contracts equipment purchases other long term obligations total contractual obligations operating lease obligations relate primarily to railroad equipment leases and include leases of other property  plant and equipment 
see note and note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company uses natural gas to power its domestic manufacturing plants 
from time to time the company enters into contracts to purchase a portion of the anticipated natural gas requirements 
the contracts are at specified prices and are typically short term in duration 
as of december   the last contract was due to expire in october the company has entered into contracts to supply raw materials  primarily kaolin and bauxite  to each of its manufacturing plants 
each of the contracts is described in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
four of the contracts do not require the company to purchase minimum annual quantities  but do require the purchase of minimum annual percentages  ranging from to of the respective plants requirements for the specified raw materials 
one contract requires the company to purchase a minimum annual quantity of material  which is included in the above table 
the company committed to purchase million in equipment related to construction of the new manufacturing plant in wilkinson county  georgia 
in the event of cancellation  some of the commitments have cancellation clauses that would require the company to pay expenses incurred by manufacturers to date and or a penalty fee 
trends  risks and uncertainties you should consider carefully the trends  risks and uncertainties described below and other information in this form k and subsequent reports filed with the securities and exchange commission before making any investment decision with respect to our securities 
if any of the following trends  risks or uncertainties actually occurs or continues  our business  financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected  the trading prices of our securities could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
our business and financial performance depend on the level of activity in the natural gas and oil industries 
our operations are materially dependent upon the levels of activity in natural gas and oil exploration  development and production 
these activity levels are affected by both short term and long term trends in natural gas and oil prices 
in recent years  natural gas and oil prices and  therefore  the level of exploration  development and production activity  have experienced significant fluctuations 
worldwide economic  political and military events  including war  terrorist activity  events in the middle east and initiatives by the organization of petroleum exporting countries  have contributed  and are likely to continue to contribute  to price volatility 
a prolonged reduction in natural gas and oil prices would depress the level of natural gas and oil exploration  development  production and well completions activity and result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our products 
such a decline could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our business and financial performance could suffer if new processes are developed to replace hydraulic fracturing 
substantially all of our products are proppants used in the completion and re completion of natural gas and oil wells through the process of hydraulic fracturing 
the development of new processes for the completion of natural gas and oil wells leading to a reduction in or discontinuation of the use of the hydraulic fracturing process could cause a decline in demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we may be adversely affected by decreased demand for ceramic proppant or the development by our competitors of effective alternative proppants 
ceramic proppant is a premium product capable of withstanding higher pressure and providing more highly conductive fractures than mined sand  which is the most commonly used proppant type 
although we believe that the use of ceramic proppant generates higher production rates and more favorable production economics than mined sand  a significant shift in demand from ceramic proppant to mined sand could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the development and use of effective alternative proppant could also cause a decline in demand for our products  and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we operate in a competitive market 
we compete with at least two other principal suppliers of ceramic proppant  as well as with suppliers of sand and resin coated sand for use as proppant  in the hydraulic fracturing of natural gas and oil wells 
the proppant market is highly competitive and no one supplier is dominant 
we rely upon  and receive a significant percentage of our revenues from  a limited number of key customers 
during  our largest customers were  in alphabetical order  bj services company  halliburton energy services  inc and schlumberger ltd  the three largest participants in the worldwide petroleum pressure pumping industry 
although the end users of our products are numerous operators of natural gas and oil wells that hire the pressure pumping service companies to hydraulically fracture wells  these three customers accounted collectively for approximately of our revenues 
we generally supply our pumping service customers with products on a just in time basis  with transactions governed by individual purchase orders 
continuing sales of product depend on our direct customers and the end user well operators being satisfied with both product quality and delivery performance 
although we believe our relations with our customers and the major well operators are satisfactory  a material decline in the level of sales to any one of our major customers due to unsatisfactory product performance  delivery delays or any other reason could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we rely on certain patents 
we own four issued united states patents and one argentinean patent 
these patents generally cover the manufacture and use of our products 
the us patents expire at various times in the years through  with two key product patents expiring in and one key patent expiring in we believe that these patents have been and will continue to be important in enabling us to compete in the market to supply proppant to the natural gas and oil industry 
there can be no assurance that our patents will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors in the future or will provide us with any competitive advantage  or that other companies will not be able to market functionally similar products without violating our patent rights 
in addition  if our patents are challenged  there can be no assurance that they will be upheld 
we intend to enforce and have in the past vigorously enforced our patents 
we are involved from time to time in litigation to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of our patent rights 
for information about litigation in which the company is currently involved  see item legal proceedings 
any such litigation could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of effort by our management and technical personnel 
furthermore  an invalidation or expiration of any of our united states patent rights and the subsequent entry of additional competitors into the market to supply ceramic proppant could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
significant increases in fuel prices for any extended periods of time will increase our operating expenses 
the price and supply of natural gas is unpredictable  and can fluctuate significantly based on international political and economic circumstances  as well as other events outside our control  such as changes in supply and demand due to weather conditions  actions by opec and other oil and gas producers  regional production patterns and environmental concerns 
natural gas is a significant component of our direct manufacturing costs and price escalations will likely increase our operating expenses and have a negative impact on income from operations and cash flows 
we operate in a competitive marketplace and may not be able to pass through all of the increased costs that could result from an increase in the cost of natural gas 
while higher natural gas costs often have the effect of increasing the demand for our products and services  our current manufacturing capacity constraint will limit our ability to benefit from increased demand until new capacity can be added 
we are exposed to increased costs associated with complying with increasing and new regulation of corporate governance and disclosure standards 
we have expended significant resources to comply with changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including under the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and new york stock exchange rules 
our compliance effort has resulted in increased expenses and these expenses are expected to continue 
environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations 
we are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to environmental protection  including laws and regulations governing air emissions  water discharges and waste management 
we incur  and expect to continue to incur  capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
the technical requirements of environmental laws and regulations are becoming increasingly expensive  complex and stringent 
these laws may provide for strict liability for damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety 
strict liability can render a party liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party 
some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances 
we use some hazardous substances and generate certain industrial wastes in our operations 
in addition  many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes 
accordingly  we could become subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties  and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to  or releases of  hazardous substances 
in addition  stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations  new laws and regulations  the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations 
our international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level that could adversely impact our results of operations 
international revenues accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues in  and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming the risks that relate to or arise from operating in international markets 
risks inherent in doing business on an international level include  among others  the following economic and political instability including as a result of the threat or occurrence of armed international conflict or terrorist attacks  changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs  customs  duties and other trade barriers  transportation delays  power supply shortages and shutdowns  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and other labor problems  currency convertibility and repatriation  taxation of our earnings and the earnings of our personnel  and potential expropriation of assets by foreign governments  other risks relating to the administration of or changes in  or new interpretations of  the laws  regulations and policies of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business 
in particular  we are subject to risks associated with our production facility in luoyang  china 
the legal system in china is still developing and is subject to change 
accordingly  our operations and orders for products in china could be adversely impacted by changes to or interpretation of chinese law 
further  if manufacturing in the region is disrupted  our overall capacity could be significantly reduced and sales and or profitability could be negatively impacted 
the market price of our common stock will fluctuate  and could fluctuate significantly 
the market price of the common stock will fluctuate  and could fluctuate significantly  in response to various factors and events  including the following the liquidity of the market for our common stock  differences between our actual financial or operating results and those expected by investors and analysts  changes in analysts recommendations or projections  new statutes or regulations or changes in interpretations of existing statutes and regulations affecting our business  changes in general economic or market conditions  and broad market fluctuations
