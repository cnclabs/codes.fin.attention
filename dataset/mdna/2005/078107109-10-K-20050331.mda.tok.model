item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to historical information  the following discussion and analysis of management contains forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  including the recoverability of assets  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other relevant assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the company s actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
critical accounting policies the summary of accounting policies within the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the following is a discussion of each of the company s critical accounting policies revenue recognition revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment of products has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price charged is fixed or determinable  and the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue recognition on product sales is not subject to significant estimates as the company has not experienced significant product returns 
the company s revenue recognition practices are not considered to involve complex estimates and judgments 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 the company records revenue either based on the gross amount billed to a customer or the net amount retained 
the company records revenue on a gross basis when it acts as a principal in the transaction  is the primary obligor in the arrangement  establishes prices  determines the supplier  and has credit risk 
the company records revenue on a net basis when the supplier is the primary obligor in the arrangement  when the amount earned is a percentage of the total transaction value and is usually received directly from the supplier  and when the supplier has credit risk 
product sales to most customers are recorded on a gross basis as the company is responsible for fulfilling the order  establishes the selling price to the customer  has the responsibility to pay suppliers for all products ordered  regardless of when  or if  it collects from the customer  and determines the credit worthiness of its customers 
arrangements with each customer are evaluated to determine if gross or net recording is appropriate 
if we make different judgments about these arrangements  material differences in the amount of revenue recognized could result 
valuation of receivables the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
changes in the credit worthiness of customers  general economic conditions and other factors may impact the level of future write offs 
valuation of inventory the company periodically reviews inventory items and overall stocking levels to ensure that adequate reserves exist for inventory deemed obsolete or excessive 
in making this determination  the company considers historical stocking levels  recent sales of similar items and forecasted demand for these items 
changes in factors such as customer demand  technology and other matters could affect the level of inventory obsolescence in the future 
income taxes provision is made for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities 
in estimating deferred tax balances  the company considers all expected future events other than enactments of changes in the tax law or rates 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
accrued liabilities the company accrues for liabilities associated with disposed businesses  including amounts related to legal  environmental and contractual matters 
in connection with these matters  the recorded liabilities include an estimate of legal fees to be incurred 
these legal fees are charged against the recorded liability when incurred 
environmental matters the company accrues for losses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable 
such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change 
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable 
costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations and expected recoveries from other parties are not discounted to their present value

factors that may affect future results of operations in addition to other information contained in this report  we are subject to the following risks  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and or results of operations in the future 
we face certain significant risks related to the currently pending williams litigation and from other potential litigation that could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we have been engaged in ongoing litigation in connection with our purchase of milgray  which was named as a defendant by the plaintiff  williams  in an action alleging common law fraud and other infractions related to williams purchase of electronic components at allegedly inflated prices from to despite a trial court verdict in  which was favorable to us  the action has been remanded for retrial 
although the outcome of this litigation cannot be predicted  an adverse verdict could have a materially adverse effect on us 
the defense of this lawsuit has required a significant amount of our management s time and attention and  even if we prevail in defending this lawsuit  we will incur additional legal and related expenses 
the disruptive effect and expense of this litigation could adversely affect our business  financial condition and or results of operations 
we also may become subject to other litigation in the future 
if we are unable to recruit and retain key personnel necessary to operate our businesses  our ability to compete successfully will be adversely affected 
we are heavily dependent on our current executive officers  management and technical personnel 
the loss of any key employee or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our current business plans and successfully develop commercially viable products and services 
competition for qualified personnel is intense  and we might not be able to retain our existing key employees or attract and retain any additional personnel 
in addition  our recent financial operating results may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel 
if we are unable to develop innovative products and services in our technology solutions and electronic component businesses  demand for our products and services may decrease 
our future operating results in our technology solutions and electronic component businesses are dependent on our ability to continually develop  introduce and market new and innovative products  to modify existing products  to respond to technological change and to customize certain products to meet customer requirements 
there are numerous risks inherent in this process  including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market new products and applications in a timely fashion to satisfy customer demands 
if this occurs  we could lose customers and experience adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations 
our previously owned businesses subject us to potential environmental liabilities  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
we are subject to various federal  state and local environmental statutes  ordinances and regulations relating to disposal of certain toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous substances and wastes used or generated in connection with previously owned businesses 
such laws may impose liability without regard to whether we knew of  or caused  the release of such hazardous substances 
although we establish reserves for specifically identified potential environmental liabilities  which reserves we believe to be adequate  there may be potential undisclosed environmental liabilities or liability in excess of the amounts reserved 
compliance with these environmental laws could require us to incur substantial expenses 
we rely on a limited number of hardware and software vendors to supply us with products in our technology solutions business and the loss of our ability to rely upon any of those vendors  or to obtain their products in the future would adversely affect our results of operations 
our technology solutions business is heavily dependent on our relationships with leading hardware and software vendors and on our status as an authorized service provider 
although we are currently authorized to service the products of many industry leading hardware and software vendors  we may not be able to maintain our relationships  or attract new relationships  with the computer hardware and software vendors that may be necessary for our technology solutions business 
since we rely upon our vendor relationships as a marketing tool  any change in these relationships could adversely affect our results of operations while we seek to establish alternative relationships with other vendors 
in general  our authorization agreements with vendors include termination provisions  some of which are immediate  and we cannot predict whether vendors will continue to authorize us as an approved service provider 
in addition  we cannot predict whether those vendors will authorize us as an approved service provider for new products  which they may introduce 
any impairment of these vendor relationships  or the loss of authorization as an approved service provider  could adversely affect our ability to provide the products and services which our technology solutions business requires and harm our competitive position 
in addition  significant product supply shortages have resulted from time to time because manufacturers have been unable to produce sufficient quantities of certain products to meet demand 
we expect to experience difficulty from time to time in obtaining an adequate supply of products from our major vendors  which may result in delays in completing sales 
our recreational products business relies heavily upon vendors with which we have no long term relationships 
we do not have long term supply contracts with our recreational products suppliers  which may adversely affect the terms on which we purchase products for resale or result in our inability to purchase products from one or more of such vendors in the future 
these vendors may choose to distribute their products directly to aftermarket dealers or establish exclusive supply relationships with other distributors 
additionally  manufacturers of new recreational vehicles  snowmobiles  motorcycles and atvs  and marine products may choose to incorporate optional equipment as standard equipment on their vehicles at the time of manufacture that are similar to products available for sale to dealers by distributors such as us 
in addition to decreased sales  we would encounter increased competition in our markets  or may be unable to offer certain products to our customers  upon any such changes in our relationships with our recreational products vendors 
we may not be able to compete effectively with other companies in our business segments  which will cause our net sales and market share to decline and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our businesses are highly competitive and we face strong competition from competitors that are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial  technical and marketing resources than us 
we believe that our prices and delivery terms are competitive  however  our competitors may offer more aggressive pricing than we do 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competitive pricing pressures in our businesses  which could require us to reduce prices  with a corresponding adverse impact on our operating results 
additionally  as competition in the technology industry has intensified  certain of our key technology suppliers have heightened their direct marketing initiatives 
these initiatives have resulted in some of our clients electing to purchase technology products directly from the manufacturer  rather than through us 
while we expect these initiatives to continue  there could be a material adverse impact on our business if the shift of clients to purchase directly from manufacturers occurs more quickly than anticipated 
our technology solutions and electronic components businesses are dependent on a limited number of major customers and clients and the loss of any of these major customers and clients would materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
sales of our products and services in our technology solutions and electronic components businesses have been and will continue to be concentrated in a small number of clients and customers 
three of our clients accounted for approximately of our total revenues for in our technology solutions business  with one client accounting for approximately of our total consolidated net revenues for the year 
similarly  five customers accounted for approximately of our total sales of electronic components in in the event that any of these major customers or clients should cease to purchase products or services from us  or purchase significantly fewer products and services in the future  we could experience materially adverse effects on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our recreational products business is seasonal and is subject to fluctuations  based upon various economic and climatic conditions that could harm us 
sales of our recreational products are affected directly by the usage levels and purchases of recreational vehicles  snowmobiles  motorcycles and atvs  and marine products 
the purchase and  in particular  the usage of these types of vehicles  are affected by weather conditions 
as a result  sales of our recreational products business are highly susceptible to unpredictable events  and ordinarily decline in the winter months resulting in losses during these periods of the year 
additionally  unusual weather conditions in a particular season  such as unusually cold weather in the spring or summer months  can cause period to period fluctuations in our sales of recreational products 
the usage and purchases of recreational vehicles  snowmobiles  motorcycles and atvs  and marine products are also affected by consumers level of discretionary income and their confidence about economic conditions and changes in interest rates and in the availability and cost of gasoline 
as a result  sales of our recreational products can fluctuate based upon unpredictable circumstances that are outside of our control and can cause us harm 
our electronic components business is cyclical and demand may decline in the future  which could adversely affect us 
during and  the electronics industry experienced a decline in product demand on a global basis  resulting in order cancellations and deferrals  lower average selling prices  and a material and adverse impact on our results of operations 
demand for electronic components  which had improved in and  began to decline late in while we expect that this recent decline is temporary  improvement in demand in the electronic and semiconductor component industry may not materialize 
if the anticipated improvement does not materialize  demand for our electronic components may decline and adversely affect our results of operations 
a significant or prolonged economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in our technology solutions business 
our results of operations are affected by the level of business activity of our clients  which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets that they serve 
the general economic weakness in the it industry resulting from among other things  the decline in discretionary it spending by our clients and prospective clients  has adversely affected our revenues in recent years 
a lack of improvement or continued decline in the level of business activity of our clients could continue to adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal and disclosure control  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud  which would harm our business and the trading price of our securities 
effective internal and disclosure controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a public company 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  our reputation and operating results would be harmed 
we are in the process of beginning a review and analysis of our internal control over financial reporting for sarbanes oxley compliance 
as part of that process we may discover material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control as defined under standards adopted by the public company accounting oversight board pcaob  that require remediation 
under the pcaob standards  a material weakness is a significant deficiency or combination of significant deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
a significant deficiency is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies  that adversely affect a company s ability to initiate  authorize  record  process  or report external financial data reliably in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles such that there is a more than remote likelihood that a misstatement of a company s annual or interim financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected 
as a result of weaknesses that may be identified in our internal control  we may also identify certain deficiencies in some of our disclosure controls and procedures that we believe require remediation 
if we discover weaknesses  we will make efforts to improve our internal and disclosure controls 
however  there is no assurance that we will be successful 
any failure to maintain effective controls or timely effect any necessary improvement of our internal and disclosure controls could harm operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
ineffective internal and disclosure controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities
