item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are an offshore oil and gas drilling contractor  currently owning or operating a fleet of marine drilling rigs  including the ultra deepwater semisubmersible  the gsf development driller ii  which was delivered in february our owned fleet includes cantilevered jackup rigs  semisubmersibles and three drillships 
we currently have an additional ultra deepwater semisubmersible nearing completion of construction  and we also operate two semisubmersible rigs for third parties under a joint venture agreement 
we provide offshore oil and gas contract drilling services to the oil and gas industry worldwide on a daily rate dayrate basis 
we also provide oil and gas drilling management services on either a dayrate or completed project  fixed price turnkey basis  as well as drilling engineering and drilling project management services  and we participate in oil and gas exploration and production activities through our wholly owned subsidiary  challenger minerals  inc cmi  principally in order to facilitate the acquisition of turnkey contracts for our drilling management services operations 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from our contract drilling and drilling management services operations  which depend on the level of drilling activity in offshore oil and natural gas exploration and development markets worldwide 
these operations are subject to a number of risks  many of which are outside our control 
for a discussion of these risks  see item and business and properties risk factors 
on may   we completed the sale of our land drilling fleet and related support equipment to precision drilling corporation for a total sales price of million in an all cash transaction 
our land drilling fleet consisted of rigs  of which were located in kuwait  eight in venezuela  four in saudi arabia  four in egypt and three in oman 
operating results for our land drilling operations had historically been included in contract drilling results 
as a result of this sale  however  results of land drilling operations have been excluded from contract drilling results and are reflected in income from discontinued operations  net of tax effect in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented 
for further information regarding our land drilling operations  see operating results sale of land drilling fleet discontinued operations 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation 
these estimates and assumptions used in connection with some of these policies affect the carrying values of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the period 
actual results could differ from such estimates and assumptions 
we consider our accounting estimates to be critical in areas where both the nature of the estimates and assumptions used are material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions is material to our operating results or financial condition 
following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates in the areas of pension costs  properties and depreciation  impairment  income taxes and turnkey drilling costs 
pension costs our pension costs and liabilities are actuarially determined based on certain assumptions including expected long term rates of return on plan assets  rate of increase in future compensation levels and the discount rate used to compute future benefit obligations 
actual results could differ materially from these actuarially determined amounts 
we use a december measurement date for our pension plans 
the following assumptions were used to determine our pension benefit obligations december  december  us plans uk plans us plans uk plans discount rate rate of compensation increase 
table of contents the following weighted average assumptions were used to determine our net periodic pension cost year ended december  us plans uk plans us plans uk plans us plans uk plans discount rate expected long term rate of return rate of compensation increase the discount rates used to calculate the net present value of future benefit obligations at december  and  and pension costs for the years ended december   and  for both our us and us plans are based on the average of current rates earned on long term bonds that receive a moody s rating of aa or better 
we employ third party consultants for our us plans who use a portfolio return model to assess the initial reasonableness of the assumption on expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
using asset class return  variance  and correlation assumptions  the model produces both the expected return and the distribution of possible returns at every fifth percentile for the chosen portfolio 
return assumptions developed by our consultants are forward looking gross returns and are not developed by an examination of historical returns 
the building block approach used by the portfolio return model begins with the current us treasury yield curve  recognizing that expected returns on bonds are heavily influenced by the current level of yields 
the model then adds corporate bond spreads and equity risk premiums based on current market conditions  to develop the return expectations for each asset class based on the investment mix for our pension plans 
the volatility and correlation assumptions are also forward looking 
they take into account historical relationships  but are adjusted by our consultants to reflect expected capital market trends 
we also employ third party consultants for our uk plans who assess the reasonableness of the assumption on expected long term rate of return on plan assets based on surveys of various uk plans with similar asset allocations and investment targets 
this assumption on expected long term rate of return on plan assets is compared to various projections of long term rates of returns compiled by both uk governmental agencies and banks 
following is a summary of how changes in the assumed discount rate and expected return on assets  assuming all other factors remain unchanged  would affect the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit expense for and related pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of december  discount rate return on plan assets in millions net periodic pension cost us plans uk plans accumulated benefit obligation us plans n a n a uk plans n a n a projected benefit obligation us plans n a n a uk plans n a n a as of december   we had an unrecognized actuarial loss totaling million for our us and us plans 
this loss will be recognized in net periodic pension cost over the estimated remaining service lives of the active participants in the plans 
approximately million of this loss is expected to be recognized in 
table of contents the calculation of our other postretirement benefits costs and liabilities includes the weighted average annual assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered medical benefits 
this assumption is based on data available to management at the time the assumption is made 
actual results could differ materially from estimated amounts 
for further discussion of the components of our net periodic pension cost and funded status of our pension plans  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
properties and depreciation rigs and drilling equipment 
capitalized costs of rigs and drilling equipment include all costs incurred in the acquisition of capital assets including allocations of interest costs incurred during periods that assets are under construction 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of property sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts  resulting gains or losses are included in income 
depreciation and amortization 
we depreciate our rigs and equipment over their remaining estimated useful lives 
our estimates of these remaining useful lives may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions  technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry  among other things 
we rely primarily on external sources of information as well as our own internal market data in assessing the impact of these factors on estimates of remaining useful lives 
estimates of remaining useful lives are also impacted by mechanical and structural factors 
we review engineering data  operating history  maintenance history and third party inspections to assess useful lives from a structural and mechanical perspective 
in determining estimated salvage values  we look primarily to external sources of information as well as our own internal data regarding the values of scrap metal and salvaged equipment 
changes in any of the assumptions made in estimating remaining useful lives and salvage values of our properties and equipment could result not only in increases or decreases in annual depreciation expense  but also could impact our criteria for analyzing properties and equipment for impairment 
we periodically evaluate the remaining useful lives and salvage values of our rigs  giving effect to operating and market conditions and upgrades performed on these rigs 
as a result of recent analyses performed on our drilling fleet  effective january   we increased the remaining lives on certain rigs in our jackup fleet to years from a range of to years  increased salvage values of these and other rigs in our jackup fleet from million per rig to amounts ranging from to million per rig  and increased the salvage values of our semisubmersibles and certain of our drillships from million per rig to amounts ranging from to million per rig 
the effect of these changes in estimates was a reduction to depreciation expense for the year ended december   of approximately million 
impairment of rigs and drilling equipment 
we review our long term assets for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
 among other things  requires that long lived assets and certain intangibles to be held and used be reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value and establishes criteria to determine when a long lived asset is classified as available for sale 
assets to be disposed of and assets not expected to provide any future service potential are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million in the first quarter of related to the sale of the platform rig rig for a nominal sum in connection with our exit from the platform rig business 
we did not incur any impairment charges in or our determination of impairment of rigs and drilling equipment  if any  requires estimates of undiscounted future cash flows 
actual impairment charges  if any  are recorded using an estimate of discounted future cash flows 
the determination of future cash flows related to our rigs and drilling equipment requires us to estimate 
table of contents dayrates and utilization in future periods  and such estimates can change based on market conditions  technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry 
significant changes to the assumptions underlying our current estimates of cash flows could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
income taxes we are a cayman islands company 
the cayman islands does not impose corporate income taxes 
consequently  our tax provision is based upon the tax laws and rates in effect in the countries in which our operations are conducted and income is earned 
the income tax rates imposed and methods of computing taxable income in these jurisdictions vary substantially 
our effective tax rate for financial statement purposes will continue to fluctuate from year to year as our operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions 
current income tax expense represents either liabilities expected to be reflected on our income tax returns for the current year  nonresident withholding taxes  or changes in prior year tax estimates which may result from tax audit adjustments 
our deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities as reported on the balance sheet 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in order to determine the amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities  as well as of valuation allowances  we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income  where rigs will be deployed and other matters 
changes in these estimates and assumptions  as well as changes in tax laws  could require us to adjust the deferred tax assets and liabilities or valuation allowances  including as discussed below 
our ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets requires that we achieve certain future earnings levels prior to the expiration of our nol carryforwards 
we have established a valuation allowance against the future tax benefit of a portion of our nol carryforwards and could be required to record an additional valuation allowance if market conditions deteriorate and future earnings are below  or are projected to be below  our current estimates 
in december  we completed a subsidiary realignment to separate our us and foreign holding company structures 
this realignment included the redemption of a minority interest in a foreign subsidiary held by one of our us subsidiaries  along with the intercompany sale of certain rigs between us and foreign subsidiaries based upon current projections of the long term geographic areas of operations of these rigs 
these transactions generated a us taxable gain which resulted in a total tax expense of approximately million 
this expense was reduced in part by the recognition of million of tax benefits resulting from the release of valuation allowances previously recorded against a portion of our us nol carryforwards  the recognition of a million tax benefit from the release of deferred tax liabilities and the deferral of million of tax expense related to the gain on the intercompany rig sales 
this net deferred tax benefit will be recognized for financial reporting purposes over the remaining useful lives of the rigs 
the total tax expense recognized for financial reporting purposes was million  comprised of million of deferred tax expense and million of current tax expense 
we have not provided for us deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of our us subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested 
should a distribution be made to us from the unremitted earnings of these us subsidiaries  we could be required to record additional us current and deferred taxes

turnkey drilling estimates turnkey drilling projects often involve numerous subcontractors and third party vendors and  as a result  the actual final project cost is typically not known at the time a project is completed 
we therefore rely on detailed 
table of contents cost estimates created by our project engineering staff to compute and record profits upon completion of turnkey drilling projects based on known revenues 
these cost estimates are adjusted as final actual project costs are determined  which may result in adjustments to previously recorded amounts 
further  we recognize estimated losses on turnkey drilling projects immediately upon occurrence of events which indicate that it is probable that a loss will be incurred and  depending on the timing of the events leading to loss recognition in relation to completion of the project  these cost estimates could be relatively significant to the total project costs

current market conditions and trends the offshore drilling business has historically been cyclical  marked by periods of low demand  excess rig supply and low dayrates  followed by periods of high demand  short rig supply and increasing dayrates 
these cycles are volatile and have traditionally been influenced by a number of factors  including oil and gas prices  the spending plans of our customers and the highly competitive nature of the offshore drilling industry 
even when rig markets appear to have stabilized at a certain level of utilization and dayrates  these markets can change swiftly  making it difficult to predict trends or conditions in the market 
the relocation of rigs from weak markets to stable or strong markets may also have a significant impact on utilization and dayrates in the affected markets 
a summary of current market conditions and trends in our areas of operations follows worldwide market conditions continue to improve in substantially all of the world s major offshore drilling markets 
our current market outlook for is one of increasing demand  resulting in higher utilization and dayrates for our cantilevered jackups  hdhe jackups and our mid water depth semisubmersibles designed for drilling in water depths of less than  feet 
we also believe that demand will exceed supply in the ultra deepwater floater market during  leading to a greater backlog and improving dayrates 
our three drillships in this market are currently committed into the fourth quarter of and into  and both of our ultra deepwater semisubmersibles are committed to long term contracts 
as market conditions improve further  we expect that a number of our competitors mid water depth semisubmersibles and jackups that are currently cold stacked ie minimally crewed with little or no scheduled maintenance being performed will reenter the market 
during prior periods of high utilization and dayrates  industry participants increased the supply of rigs by ordering the construction of new units  creating an oversupply of drilling units and a decline in utilization and dayrates when the rigs entered the market  sometimes for extended periods of time 
there are currently twenty jackup rigs under contract for construction with delivery dates ranging from to most of these are cantilevered units capable of drilling in water depths in the to foot range  and are considered to be premium units 
there are no semisubmersibles  other than ours  or drillships under construction  although a small number of units are being upgraded to a greater operating capability 
we do not currently anticipate that this potential increase in the number of active units will have a significant adverse effect on dayrates in the near future  although the entry into service of units that are currently cold stacked or under construction will increase supply and could curtail a further strengthening of dayrates in the affected markets or result in a softening of the affected markets as rigs are absorbed into the active fleet 
any further increase in construction of new drilling units would likely exacerbate the adverse effect on utilization and dayrates 
us gulf of mexico we currently operate eight cantilevered jackups and one mid water semisubmersible in the us gulf of mexico 
the continuing strength in natural gas prices  combined with the mobilization of rigs to other markets in pursuit of longer term or higher dayrate contracts has resulted in significant increases in utilization and dayrates for jackup rigs in this market 
we believe dayrates will continue to increase through as demand for jackups in this market comes into balance with the remaining supply 
as utilization of active rigs has improved  several 
table of contents previously cold stacked lower specification rigs have reentered the market but to date  these additional units have had no significant adverse impact on dayrates 
ultra deepwater market in the ultra deepwater market  we have observed a significant increase in dayrates as the number of projects requiring rigs with the technical specifications common to rigs capable of drilling in  feet of water or greater continues to increase and operators have been securing rigs for long term development projects 
as a result  we believe the equipment in this asset class will be fully utilized through the end of and well into we currently operate three ultra deepwater drillships and one ultra deepwater semisubmersible in this market 
north sea our north sea fleet currently includes four mid water depth semisubmersibles one of which is cold stacked  four cantilevered hdhe jackups  and two cantilevered jackups 
dayrates for active semisubmersibles continue to improve as drilling activity increases while the number of active rigs in this market has remained relatively constant 
utilization of the industry s active fleet is currently and most of these rigs are committed through although three of our competitors cold stacked semisubmersibles have been contracted to reenter the market  there has not been an adverse effect on dayrates to date 
seven additional mid water depth semisubmersibles  however  remain cold stacked in this region  which will likely limit the level to which dayrates can increase 
in light of recent strength in dayrates for semisubmersibles in the north sea  we are currently evaluating the cost to reactivate the gsf arctic ii  our cold stacked semisubmersible in this market 
the market for hdhe jackup rigs in the north sea remains strong  with a gradual increase in demand expected in as a result  we are beginning to see increases in dayrates for rigs in this class as rigs complete their current contracts and we expect this to continue through the standard specification jackup rig market in the north sea is beginning to show signs of recovery from the low utilization and dayrates experienced in we expect the overall demand for rigs in this class to continue to improve through  with resulting increases in dayrates 
west africa we currently operate nine cantilevered jackups and two mid water depth semisubmersibles in the west africa market 
due to the continued mobilization of jackup rigs out of this market to other markets  we expect demand for jackup rigs to possibly exceed supply in as activity in this market increases 
current industry jackup utilization in this market is approaching  and there are no cold stacked jackups in this region 
as a result  we expect further increases in dayrates for available units in this area in two of our cantilevered jackups in this market are currently committed to long term contracts 
the gsf adriatic v jackup began a year contract in angola in october  and the gsf adriatic ii jackup began a year contract in november while dayrates for mid water semisubmersibles in this area have shown considerable signs of improvement  we could experience periods of idle time between drilling programs 
several of our competitors units left the area in  resulting in a tighter market which should exert upward pressure on dayrates 
we expect activity in this market to improve beginning in mid southeast asia we currently operate seven cantilevered jackups in the southeast asia market 
although there has been a net increase in rigs in the region in  we expect increasing demand to exceed the available supply of rigs in this market during  creating shortages of available rigs and possibly delaying some drilling programs 
due to increases in demand in other markets  we believe it is unlikely that there will be any significant movements of rigs into this area from other markets in as a result  we expect continuing upward pressure on dayrates until the delivery during the period of late to of newbuild rigs currently under construction in singapore 

table of contents middle east mediterranean we currently operate ten jackups in the middle east and mediterranean markets  consisting of three in the egyptian mediterranean  three in the gulf of suez  and four in the arabian gulf 
we expect the mediterranean jackup market to remain strong throughout we also continue to see strong demand for jackups in the arabian gulf  and we expect demand  especially for premium equipment  to increase in this area in there are currently eleven jackups working in the gulf of suez with two operators holding more than of the rig contracts 
although these operators continue to curtail spending in this mature area in favor of more attractive projects in the mediterranean  we expect a balanced market in this area as other markets in the middle east and mediterranean absorb any excess supply that develops 
south america we currently operate one jackup offshore argentina  one mid water semisubmersible offshore venezuela and one hdhe jackup and two cantilevered jackups offshore trinidad  including the gsf constellation i  which commenced its long term contract in august although this market currently remains balanced  there are a limited number of drilling programs currently available 
as a result  we expect that one or more of our units will leave this area during we expect little additional jackup demand to develop in the south american market through the first half of canada we currently operate one hdhe jackup and one semisubmersible off the east coast of canada

reimbursable revenues represent reimbursements from customers for certain out of pocket expenses incurred and have little or no effect on operating income 
other revenues include rig mobilization fees and miscellaneous fees including fees for labor  material  rental  handling and incentive bonuses 
the decreases in dayrates and utilization were due primarily to lower dayrates and utilization for our ultra deepwater rigs and for our west africa drilling fleet  along with lower utilization and dayrates for the gsf galaxy ii off the eastern coast of canada  which remained idle for substantially all of the first half of before

r 
luigs in the us gulf of mexico and lower utilization of the gsf grand banks off the east coast of canada  which was idle through the first half of these decreases in marine drilling revenues were offset in part by increases in both dayrates and utilization for our us gulf of mexico jackup fleet and by an increase in utilization for gsf rig in southeast asia  which was undergoing upgrades during a substantial portion of contract drilling operating expenses before intersegment eliminations decreased by million to million in compared to million in  due primarily to decreases in repair and maintenance expenses  reimbursable expenses  merger related transition expenses incurred in  and lower labor expense 
the decrease in repair and maintenance expense was due to repair projects performed on several of our rigs in  offset in part by repairs and maintenance work performed concurrent with upgrades on the gsf grand banks in the decrease in labor expense was due primarily to the lower utilization of the north sea  west africa and middle east drilling fleets discussed above  offset in part by an increase in pension expense 
we recorded approximately million of merger related transition expenses in our contract drilling operations during  which represent costs incurred as part of the integration of the operations of global marine and santa fe international 
contract drilling depreciation expense increased by million to million from million in  due primarily to upgrades on several of our rigs during and the addition of the gsf constellation i  which was placed into service in august the effects of the lower dayrates and utilization and higher depreciation expense discussed above were reflected in our operating income and margin for contract drilling operations  which decreased to million and  respectively  for the year ended december   from million and  respectively  for drilling management services results of operations from our drilling management services segment may be limited by certain factors  in particular our ability to find and retain qualified personnel  to hire suitable rigs at acceptable rates  and to obtain and successfully perform turnkey drilling contracts based on competitive bids 
our ability to obtain turnkey drilling contracts is largely dependent on the number of such contracts available for bid  which in turn is influenced by market prices for oil and gas  among other factors 
furthermore  our ability to enter into turnkey drilling contracts may be constrained from time to time by the availability of globalsantafe or third party drilling rigs 
drilling management services results are also affected by the required deferral of turnkey drilling profit related to wells in which cmi is either the operator or holds a working interest 
this turnkey profit is credited to our full cost pool of oil and gas properties and is recognized over future periods through a lower depletion rate as reserves are produced 
accordingly  results of our drilling management service operations may vary widely from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  drilling management services revenues increased by million to million for the year ended december   from million for approximately million of this increase was attributable to higher average revenues per turnkey project and million was attributable to an increase in the number of turnkey projects completed  offset in part by an million decrease in reimbursable revenues and a million decrease in daywork and other revenues 
the decrease in reimbursable revenues is due primarily to a decrease in project management operations in as noted above in the discussion of our contract drilling results  however  reimbursable revenues represent reimbursements received from the client for certain out of pocket expenses and have little or no effect on operating income 
we completed turnkey projects in wells drilled and well completions  compared to turnkey projects in wells drilled and well completions

turnkey drilling projects often involve numerous subcontractors and third party vendors and  as a result  the actual final project cost is typically not known at the time a project is completed see critical accounting estimates turnkey drilling estimates 
results for the years ended december  and  were favorably affected by downward revisions to cost estimates of wells completed in prior years totaling million and million  respectively  which represented approximately and  respectively  of drilling management services expenses for and the effect of these revisions was more than offset  however  by the deferral of turnkey profit totaling million in and million in related to wells in which cmi was either the operator or held a working interest

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   increased by million to million  or of revenues  from million  or of revenues  for the increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to an increase in management bonus accruals from relatively low levels  as discussed below  along with an increase in consulting fees incurred as part of our implementation of the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for due primarily to lower management bonus accruals and professional fees 
the lower management bonus accruals were a result of our lower than budgeted operating results for the decrease in professional fees resulted primarily from non recurring professional fees incurred during as part of the integration of the operations of global marine and santa fe subsequent to the merger 
other income and expense interest expense was million for  million for and million for the decrease in interest expense for was due primarily to the retirement of global marine inc s notes due on june   as discussed below

other expense of million for the year ended december   includes a loss of million on a commodity derivative entered into in the first quarter of  offset in part by realized gains of million on the sale of marketable securities related to one of our nonqualified pension plans 
other income totaled million for the year ended december   due primarily to million awarded to us in as a result of the settlement of claims filed in with the united nations compensation commission uncc for losses suffered as a result of the iraqi invasion of kuwait in the claims were for the loss of four rigs and associated equipment  lost revenue and miscellaneous expenditures 
other income totaled million in  due primarily to net gains totaling million recorded on embedded derivative financial instruments associated with two year variable dayrate contracts for two of our cantilevered jackups 
these net gains in were offset in part by a million loss on the sale of long term marketable securities related to one of our retirement plans 
income taxes our effective income tax rates for financial reporting purposes were approximately  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the effective rate for includes the effect of a million charge related to the subsidiary realignment discussed below 
excluding the million charge  our income tax expense would have been million  which when divided into our pretax income from continuing operations of million  yields an effective tax rate of 
the effective rate for was reduced by the effect of the million uncc settlements discussed above  partially offset by a net total of million of other discrete items 
excluding these settlements  our pretax income from continuing operations for would have been million  which when divided into the tax provision from continuing operations of million  yields an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax of excluding the million charge is higher than due primarily to a change in our mix of earnings between domestic earnings and foreign earnings in high and low tax jurisdictions 
the tax provision for also includes a net deferred tax benefit of million related to the release of a valuation allowance against our uk nol carryforwards 
we determined during that  based on earnings projections at that time  it was more likely than not that the remaining nol carryforwards balance in this jurisdiction would be fully utilized 
the effective tax rates for and excluding the effects of these unusual items are presented because we believe that these effective tax rates will provide assistance in comparing the results between the periods 
in december  we completed a realignment of our subsidiaries to separate our international and domestic holding companies to improve operational and financial efficiencies within our organization 
this realignment included the redemption of a minority interest in a foreign subsidiary held by one of our us subsidiaries  along with the intercompany sale of certain rigs between us and foreign subsidiaries based upon current projections of the long term geographic areas of operations of these rigs 
these transactions generated a us taxable gain which resulted in a total tax expense of approximately million 
this expense was reduced in part by the recognition of million of tax benefits resulting from the release of valuation 
table of contents allowances previously recorded against a portion of our us nol carryforwards  the recognition of a million tax benefit from the release of deferred tax liabilities and the deferral of million of tax expense related to the gain on the intercompany rig sales 
this net deferred tax benefit will be recognized for financial reporting purposes over the remaining useful lives of the rigs 
the total tax expense recognized for financial reporting purposes was million  comprised of million of deferred tax expense and million of current tax expense 
we decreased the valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions by million and million in and  respectively 
as discussed above  a portion of the decrease relates to the nol carryforwards in the uk we determined during that  based on earnings projections at that time  it was more likely than not that the remaining nol carryforwards balance in this jurisdiction would be fully utilized 
this adjustment resulted in a net deferred tax benefit of million 
we intend to permanently reinvest all of the unremitted earnings of our us subsidiaries in their businesses 
as a result  we have not provided for us deferred taxes on million of cumulative unremitted earnings at december  the reduction in unremitted earnings at december   compared to the billion of unremitted earnings at december   is primarily the result of the subsidiary realignment mentioned above 
should a distribution be made to us from the unremitted earnings of our us subsidiaries  we could be required to record additional us current and deferred taxes 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of deferred tax liability associated with these unremitted earnings 
transactions with affiliates in connection with the initial public offering of santa fe international  santa fe international entered into an intercompany agreement with kuwait petroleum corporation and sfic holdings  which agreement was amended in connection with the merger 
the intercompany agreement  as amended  provides that  as long as kuwait petroleum corporation and its affiliates  in the aggregate  own at least of our outstanding ordinary shares  the consent of sfic holdings is required to change the jurisdiction of any of our existing subsidiaries or incorporate a new subsidiary in any jurisdiction in a manner materially adversely affecting the rights or interests of kuwait petroleum corporation and its affiliates or to reincorporate us in another jurisdiction

as part of our land drilling operations  we provided contract drilling services in kuwait to the kuwait oil company  ksc koc  a subsidiary of kuwait petroleum corporation  and also provided contract drilling services to a partially owned affiliate of koc in the kuwait saudi arabian partitioned neutral zone 
such services were performed pursuant to drilling contracts containing terms and conditions and rates of compensation which materially approximated those that were customarily included in arm s length contracts of a similar nature 
in connection therewith  koc provided us rent free use of certain land and maintenance facilities 
on may   we completed the sale of our land drilling fleet and related support equipment and we no longer provide contract drilling services to koc 
we still  however  maintain an agency agreement with a subsidiary of kuwait petroleum corporation that obligates us to pay certain agency fees 
we believe the terms of this agreement are more favorable than those which could be obtained with an unrelated third party in an arm s length negotiation  but the value of such terms is currently immaterial to our results of operations

 share based payment sfasr 
this statement revises fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee stock options and other awards of stock based compensation based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date 
this statement supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 which allowed companies to compute compensation cost for each employee stock option granted as the amount by which the quoted market price of the common stock on the date of grant exceeds the amount the employee must pay to acquire the stock 
we currently account for our stock option and stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method under apb opinion no

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in  we entered into fixed price contracts for the construction of two dynamically positioned  ultra deepwater drillships  the gsf cr luigs and the gsf jack ryan  which began operating in april and december  respectively 
pursuant to two year capital lease agreements  we subsequently novated the construction contracts for the drillships to two financial institutions the lessors  which now own the drillships and lease them to us 
we have deposited with three large foreign banks the payment banks amounts equal to the progress payments that the lessors were required to make under the construction contracts  less a lease benefit of approximately million the defeasance payment 
in exchange for the deposits  the payment banks have assumed liability for making rental payments required under the leases and the lessors have legally released us as the primary obligor of such rental payments 
accordingly  we have recorded no capital lease obligations on our balance sheet with respect to the two drillships 
we have interest rate risk in connection with these fully defeased financing leases for the gsf jack ryan and gsf c 
r 
luigs 
the defeasance payment earns interest based on the british pound sterling three month libor  which approximated at the time of the agreement 
should the defeasance payment earn less than the assumed rate of interest  we will be required to make additional payments as necessary to augment the annual payments made by the payment banks pursuant to the agreements 
if the december   libor rate of were to continue over the next eight years  we would be required to fund an additional estimated million during that period 
any additional payments made by us pursuant to the financing leases would increase the carrying value of our leasehold interest in the rigs and therefore be reflected in higher depreciation expense over their then remaining useful lives 
we do not expect that  if required  any additional payments made under these leases would be material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows in any given year 
in addition to these defeased financing leases  we also have entered into fixed for floating interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of million as of december   effectively converting a portion of our notes into variable rate debt see fair value risk below 
we do not consider our exposure to interest rate fluctuations as a result of these swaps to be material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
fair value risk investments 
the objectives of our investment strategy are safety of principal  liquidity maintenance  yield maximization and full investment of all available funds 
as a result  the portion of our short term investment portfolio classified as cash and cash equivalents at december   consisted primarily of high credit quality commercial paper  us treasury notes  eurodollar debt securities and money market funds  all with original maturities of less than three months 
we believe that the carrying value of these investments approximated market value at december   due to the short term nature of these instruments 
as part of our cost effectiveness efforts  we have outsourced the management of portions of our marketable securities portfolio to third party investment firms 
these firms manage the investment of these securities with the goal of optimizing returns on these investments while investing within guidelines set forth by our management 
pursuant to the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  we changed the classification of our marketable securities portfolio from held to maturity to available for sale  effective june   and have recorded these marketable securities at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet at december  in addition  we held other investments in debt and equity securities also classified as available for sale held in connection with certain nonqualified pension plans  which were included in other assets at december  
table of contents and unrealized gains included in accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheet at december   related to our total marketable securities portfolio totaled approximately million 
long term debt 
our long term debt is subject to fair value risk due to changes in market interest rates 
in addition  the fair value of our zero coupon convertible debt is subject to changes in the market price of our ordinary shares 
the estimated fair value of our million principal amount notes due  based on quoted market prices  was million at december   compared to the carrying amount of million 
the estimated fair value of our million zero coupon convertible debentures due  based on quoted market prices  was million at december   compared to the carrying amount of million 
the estimated fair value of our million principal amount notes due  based on quoted market prices  was million at december   compared to the carrying amount of million 
the carrying value of our notes due includes a mark to market adjustment of million at december   related to fixed for floating interest rate swaps discussed below 
we have engaged third party consultants to assess the impact of changes in interest rates and share prices on the fair values of our long term debt based on a hypothetical ten percent increase in market interest rates and a hypothetical ten percent decrease in the price of our ordinary shares 
market interest rate and share price volatility are dependent on many factors that are impossible to forecast  and actual interest rate increases and share price decreases could be more severe than the hypothetical ten percent change 
based upon these sensitivity analyses  if prevailing market interest rates had been ten percent higher at december   and all other factors affecting our debt remained the same  the fair value of our notes due  as determined on a present value basis using prevailing market interest rates  would have decreased by million or  the fair value of the notes due would have decreased by million or  and the fair value of our zero coupon convertible debt would have decreased by less than one percent 
with respect to our zero coupon convertible debt  if the market price of our ordinary shares had been ten percent lower at december   and all other factors remained the same  the decrease in the fair value of the zero coupon convertible debt would have been less than one percent 
we manage our fair value risk related to our long term debt by using interest rate swaps to convert a portion of our fixed rate debt into variable rate debt 
under these interest rate swaps  we agree with other parties to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between the fixed rate and floating rate amounts  calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional amount 
in august  we entered into fixed for floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million  effective august through february in may  we entered into fixed for floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million  effective may through february these interest rate swaps are intended to manage a portion of the fair value risk related to our notes due the notes 
under the terms of these swaps  we have agreed to pay the counterparties an interest rate equal to the six month libor rate less to on the notional amounts and we will receive the fixed rate 
as of december   we had fixed for floating interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of million related to our notes 
the total estimated aggregate fair value of these swaps at december   was an asset of million 
in connection with the sensitivity analyses performed relative to the fair values of our long term debt discussed above  similar analyses were performed to assess the impact of market interest rate movements on the fair values of the fixed for floating swaps related to the notes 
based upon these analyses  if prevailing market interest rates had been ten percent higher at december   and all other factors affecting these swaps had remained the same  the aggregate fair value of the fixed for floating interest rate swaps  as determined on a present value basis using prevailing market interest rates  would have decreased by million or 

table of contents foreign currency risk we are subject to foreign currency risk throughout our international operations see risk factors we may suffer losses as a result of foreign exchange restrictions  foreign currency fluctuations and limitations on our ability to repatriate income or capital to the us 
we attempt to minimize this currency risk by seeking international drilling contracts payable in local currency in amounts equal to our estimated local currency based operating costs and in us dollars for the balance of the contract 
we incurred foreign currency exchange losses totaling approximately million in our foreign currency exchange gains and losses were immaterial for and due to the multiple foreign currencies impacting our various areas of operations  we cannot accurately quantify through a sensitivity analysis the impact of changes in these currencies 
although we have not historically entered into financial hedging transactions to manage risks relating to fluctuations in currency exchange rates  we may enter into such transactions in the future 
credit risk the market for our services and products is the offshore oil and gas industry  and our customers consist primarily of major integrated international oil companies and independent oil and gas producers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and have not historically required material collateral 
we maintain reserves for potential credit losses  and such losses have been within management s expectations 
our cash deposits were distributed among various banks in our areas of operations throughout the world as of december  in addition  we had commercial paper  money market funds and eurodollar time deposits with a variety of financial institutions with strong credit ratings 
as a result  we believe that credit risk in such instruments is minimal
