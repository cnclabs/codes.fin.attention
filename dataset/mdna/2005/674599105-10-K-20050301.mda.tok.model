item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a incorporating item a in this report  the term occidental refers to occidental petroleum corporation opc and or one or more entities in which it owns a majority voting interest subsidiaries 
occidental is divided into two segments oil and gas and chemical 
strategy general occidental aims to generate competitive total returns to stockholders using the following strategy focus on large  long lived oil and gas assets with growth potential 
maintain financial discipline and a strong balance sheet 
manage chemical segment to provide cash in excess of normal capital expenditures 
occidental prefers to own large  long lived legacy oil and gas assets  like those in california  the permian basin and qatar  that tend to have moderate decline rates  enhanced secondary and tertiary recovery opportunities and economies of scale that lead to cost effective production 
management expects such assets to contribute substantial earnings and cash flow after invested capital 
at occidental  maintaining financial discipline means investing capital in projects that management expects will generate above cost of capital returns throughout the business cycle 
during periods of high commodity prices  occidental will use most of its cash flow after capital expenditures and dividends to improve future earnings by making such investments or through debt reduction 
the chemical business is not managed with a growth strategy 
capital is expended to operate the chemical business in a safe and environmentally sound way  to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects designed to lower manufacturing costs 
asset acquisitions may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chlor alkali and polyvinyl chloride businesses 
historically  the chemical segment has generated cash flow exceeding its normal capital expenditure requirements 
occidental intends to invest this cash mainly in strategically attractive assets or to reduce debt 
as part of occidental s strategy to grow its oil and gas business  any excess cash generated by the chemical segment may be used as part of the overall funding for oil and gas growth 
oil and gas the oil and gas business seeks to add new oil and natural gas reserves at a pace well ahead of production while keeping costs incurred for finding and development among the lowest in the industry 
the oil and gas business implements this strategy within the limits of the overall corporate strategy primarily by continuing to add commercial reserves through a combination of focused exploration and development programs conducted in and around occidental s core areas  which are the us  the middle east and latin america  pursuing commercial opportunities in core areas to enhance the development of mature fields with large volumes of remaining oil by applying appropriate technology and state of the art reservoir management practices  and maintaining a disciplined approach in buying and selling assets at attractive prices 
over the past several years  occidental has strengthened its asset base within each of the core areas 
occidental has invested in  and disposed of  assets with the goal of raising the average performance and potential of its assets 
see oil and gas segment business review for a discussion of these changes 
occidental s overall performance during the past several years reflects the successful implementation of its oil and gas business strategy  beginning with the acquisition of the elk hills oil and gas field in california followed by the purchase of altura energy in the permian basin in west texas and thereafter by several smaller acquisitions 
at the end of  the elk hills and permian basin assets made up percent of occidental s consolidated proven oil reserves and percent of its consolidated proven gas reserves 
on a barrels of oil equivalent boe basis  they accounted for percent of occidental s consolidated reserves 
in  the combined production from these assets averaged approximately  boe per day  which represents approximately percent of occidental s total worldwide production 
these assets also contributed approximately percent of oil and gas segment earnings 
chemical oxychem s strategy is to be a low cost producer so that it can maximize its cash flow generation 
oxychem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain where it begins with chlorine  which is coproduced with caustic soda  and then converts chlorine and ethylene  through a series of intermediate products  into pvc 
oxychem s focus on chlorovinyls permits it to take advantage of economies of scale 
key performance indicators general occidental seeks to ensure that it meets its strategic goals by continuously measuring its success in maintaining below average debt levels and top quartile performance compared to its peers in overall return on equity  overall return on capital employed  and other segment specific measurements such as profit per unit produced  cost to produce each unit  cash flow per unit  cost to find and develop new reserves and other similar measures 
debt structure occidental s total debt and total debt to capitalization ratios are shown in the table below total debt to capitalization date amounts in millions total debt a ratio a includes trust preferred securities redeemed january   natural gas delivery commitment terminated in  subsidiary preferred stock and capital lease obligations 
as shown  occidental s year end total debt to capitalization ratio declined to approximately percent from the percent level that existed at the end of the decrease in the total debt to capitalization ratio in compared with resulted from total debt reductions of percent combined with an increase in stockholders equity of percent over the same period 
return on equity annual a three year average b a the return on equity for was calculated by dividing occidental s earnings applicable to common stock by the average equity balance in b the three year average return on equity was calculated by dividing the average annual earnings applicable to common stock over the three year period by the average equity balance over the same period 
over the past three years  occidental has focused on improving its return on equity 
in  occidental s return on equity was percent and the three year average return on equity was percent 
during the same three year period  occidental s equity increased by over percent 
oil and gas segment business environment oil and gas prices are the key variables that drive the industry s financial performance 
prices can vary significantly  even on a short term basis 
oil prices continued to strengthen in over their levels in the previous year 
during the year  occidental experienced an increase in its price differential between the average west texas intermediate wti price and occidental s realized prices 
occidental s realized crude oil price was per barrel in the fourth quarter of  compared to per barrel in the third quarter of during this same period  wti prices increased per barrel 
the change in the differential between the average price of wti and occidental s realized price was primarily due to a significant increase in the volume of sour crude oil in global markets 
approximately percent of occidental s crude oil could be classified as sour 
this change in the historical pattern of differentials makes forecasting realized prices difficult 
the average wti market price for was per barrel compared with per barrel in occidental s average realized price for oil in was  compared with in nymex domestic natural gas prices increased approximately percent from for  nymex gas prices averaged mcf compared with mcf for business review all production and reserve figures are net to occidental unless otherwise specified 
elk hills occidental operates the elk hills oil and gas field in the southern portion of california s san joaquin valley with an approximate percent interest 
the field was acquired in for billion and is the largest producer of gas in california 
oil and gas production in was approximately  boe per day 
since its acquisition  total elk hills oil and gas production has been approximately million boe 
at the end of  the property still had an estimated million boe of proved reserves  compared to the million boe that were recorded at the time of the acquisition 
total gas production averaged million cubic feet mmcf per day in compared to mmcf per day in permian basin the permian basin extends throughout southwest texas and southeast new mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the united states  with the entire basin accounting for approximately percent of total us oil production 
occidental is the largest producer in the permian basin with an approximately percent net share of the total permian basin oil production 
occidental also produces and processes natural gas and natural gas liquids ngl in the permian basin 
most of occidental s permian basin interests were obtained through the acquisition of altura in  which was valued at approximately billion 
on january   occidental acquired a  mile oil gathering and pipeline system in the permian basin that includes storage facilities at a marketing hub in midland 
this system allows occidental to efficiently transport its production to these storage facilities 
the pipeline is also used to transport production for third party producers 
occidental s total share of permian basin oil  gas and ngl production averaged  boe per day in compared to  boe per day in at the end of  occidental s permian basin properties had  million boe in proved reserves 
occidental s permian basin production is diversified across a large number of producing areas 
the largest producing areas include wasson san andres  slaughter  levelland  north cowden and wasson clearfork  which contributed percent  percent  percent  percent and percent  respectively  to permian boe production 
approximately percent of occidental s permian basin production is from fields that employ the application of carbon dioxide co flood technology  an enhanced oil recovery technique 
this involves injecting co into oil reservoirs where it acts as a solvent  causing the oil to flow more freely into producing wells 
the size of these co flood operations makes occidental a world leader in the application of this technology 
thums occidental purchased thums  the field contractor for an oil production unit offshore long beach  california  in occidental s share of production from thums is subject to contractual arrangements similar to a production sharing contract psc  whereby occidental s share of production varies inversely with oil prices 
for  production from thums averaged  barrels per day 
gulf of mexico occidental has a one third interest in the deep water horn mountain oil field  which is occidental s only asset in the gulf of mexico 
bp plc bp is the operator 
the field  which began production in november  reached platform capacity in the third quarter of for  occidental s production at horn mountain averaged  boe per day 
in the second half of  the horn mountain field was shut down for about days due to hurricane ivan 
at year end  production at the field again reached its capacity 
hugoton occidental owns a large concentration of gas reserves  production interests and royalty interests in the hugoton area of kansas and oklahoma 
the hugoton field is the largest natural gas field discovered in north america 
occidental s hugoton operations produced  mcf of natural gas per day and  barrels of oil per day in middle east dolphin project occidental s interest in the dolphin project  which was acquired in  consists of two separate economic interests held through two separate legal entities 
one entity  oxy dolphin e p  llc  owns a percent undivided interest in the assets and liabilities associated with a development and production sharing agreement dpsa with the government of qatar to develop and produce natural gas and condensate in qatar s north field for years from the start of production  with a provision to request a year extension 
the purchase price of the undivided working interest in the dpsa was approximately million and was recorded in property  plant equipment 
this undivided interest will be proportionately consolidated in occidental s financial statements 
a second entity  oxy dolphin pipeline  llc  owns percent of the stock of dolphin energy limited dolphin energy 
dolphin energy owns the rights to build  own and operate a mile long  inch natural gas pipeline which will transport dry natural gas from qatar to the united arab emirates uae for the life of the dolphin project or longer 
initially  the dolphin project will export billion cubic feet bcf per day of natural gas plus associated liquids and byproducts 
however  the pipeline is expected to have capacity to transport up to bcf of natural gas per day  and dolphin energy is pursuing additional business opportunities to meet the growing demand for natural gas in the uae and oman 
the purchase price of dolphin energy stock totaled approximately million and was recorded as an equity investment 
several important milestones have been reached since occidental joined the dolphin project 
in  two development wells were drilled and tested  providing sufficient information to complete the field development plan 
in october  dolphin energy signed two year contracts to supply approximately one bcf of natural gas per day to two entities in the uae 
as stated above  demand for natural gas is growing in the uae and oman and a third supply contract with the emirate of dubai is currently being negotiated 
in december  the government of qatar approved the final field development plan for the dolphin project 
in january  dolphin energy was awarded engineering  procurement and construction epc contracts for the gas processing and compression plant at ras laffan in qatar as well as for two offshore gas production platforms 
dolphin energy is operator on behalf of the contractors under the dpsa 
the remaining major epc contracts were also awarded during to date  occidental has recorded million boe of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves for the dolphin project dpsa activity 
the ras laffan plant will receive wet gas from dolphin s facilities in qatar s north field and will remove hydrocarbon liquids  including condensate and natural gas liquids  for further processing and sale in the global market 
the resulting dry gas will be compressed and transported to the uae through dolphin energy s pipeline 
the projected start up date for production is in late the dolphin project is expected to cost approximately billion in total 
occidental expects to invest approximately billion of this total 
the project will be financed by a combination of participant investment and project financing 
during  occidental expects to spend a combined total of approximately million for the gas exploration and development activity and the investment in dolphin energy compared to million in no revenue or production costs were recorded in for the dolphin project gas exploration and development activity 
qatar occidental participates in two production projects in qatar idd el shargi south dome issd and idd el shargi north dome isnd 
occidental is engaged in phase ii of full field development of isnd and is in the process of developing the issd field 
issd is a satellite to the isnd field  thereby reducing the overall capital requirement of the two projects 
occidental expects to increase production and recoverable reserves with the second phase of development under its existing agreement in the isnd field 
this new phase is targeting the development and recovery of additional reserves by applying advanced drilling systems and improved reservoir characterization techniques 
capital expenditures in qatar for the issd and isnd projects were million in and are expected to be approximately million in combined production from the two fields averaged  barrels per day in also  see the dolphin project discussed above 
yemen in yemen  occidental owns direct working interests in the masila field in block percent and a percent interest in the east shabwa field  comprising a percent direct working interest and an percent equity interest in an unconsolidated entity 
occidental s production averaged  barrels of oil per day in  with  coming from the masila field and the remainder from east shabwa 
in addition  occidental operates block  where it owns an percent working interest 
occidental drilled two exploratory wells in block in oman occidental s oman business is centered in block where it is the operator and holds a percent working interest 
under the block psc  occidental s share of production averaged  barrels of oil per day in in march  occidental began selling gas to the government of oman under a gas sales agreement  thereby allowing occidental to produce previously stranded gas and condensates from block under the agreement  occidental and its block partner must supply approximately mmcf per day of natural gas until december  thereafter  occidental will nominate quantities that it has available for delivery 
since march  occidental and its partner supplied an average of approximately mmcf per day of natural gas to the government under the gas sales agreement  including gas delivered during a commissioning period and prior to occidental s obligation to deliver gas 
the minimum gross quantities to be delivered under the gas sales agreement through december  represent approximately percent of the expected average gross production of gas from block during that period 
as of december   the gross proved gas reserves from block are approximately percent of the total minimum of gas that remains to be delivered under the gas sales agreement 
occidental also holds a percent working interest in block  which is adjacent to block as operator  occidental is conducting an active exploration program in block libya occidental suspended all activities in libya in as a result of economic sanctions imposed by the us government  but continues to hold an interest in the assets that it formerly operated 
since the imposition of sanctions  occidental has derived no economic benefit from its libyan interests and has no libyan assets on its balance sheet 
in  the us government lifted all of the principal economic sanctions against libya 
as a result  occidental began actively negotiating with the libyan government for occidental s return to its historical assets in libya 
those negotiations are continuing 
separately  in january  occidental participated in the epsa iv exploration bid round in libya 
occidental was the successful bidder on nine of the areas available 
occidental will operate five onshore areas and will have a percent exploration working interest 
in addition  occidental will have a percent exploration working interest in four offshore areas 
the offshore areas will be operated by woodside petroleum ltd 
other eastern hemisphere pakistan occidental holds oil and gas working interests  that vary from to percent  in four badin blocks in pakistan 
bp is the operator 
occidental s share of production was approximately  boe per day in russia in russia  occidental owns percent of a joint venture company  vanyoganneft  that operates in the western siberian oil basin 
production for was approximately  boe per day 
latin america colombia in april  occidental extended the term of its contract with the government of colombia for the cano limon field 
the contract was extended to the economic life of the field 
occidental has a percent net share of production and is the operator of the field 
colombia s national oil company  ecopetrol  operates the cano limon covenas oil pipeline and marine export terminal 
the pipeline transports oil produced from the cano limon field for export to international markets 
in addition  occidental also has various working interests in four exploration blocks 
occidental s share of production averaged  barrels of oil per day 
ecuador occidental operates block in ecuador and has a percent economic interest therein 
although occidental holds legal title to percent of the block participation contract  it has farmed out percent of its economic interest related to block occidental s share of production averaged approximately  barrels of oil per day in in addition  occidental has a percent interest in the oleoducto de crudos pesados ltd 
ocp oil export pipeline 
see off balance sheet arrangements for further information about the ocp pipeline 
full development of the eden yuturi oil field in the southeastern corner of block continued in additional development wells drilled in the western portion of the block resulted in an increase in production of approximately  barrels from the  barrels per day produced in after completing extensive d seismic surveys occidental continues to expand its exploration activities in block foreign oil companies  including occidental  have been paying a value added tax vat  generally calculated on the basis of to percent of expenditures for goods and services used in the production of oil for export 
until  oil companies  like other companies producing products for export  filed for and received reimbursement of vat 
in  the ecuador tax authority announced that the oil companies vat payments did not qualify for reimbursement 
in  occidental initiated an international arbitration proceeding against the ecuadorian government under the united states ecuador bilateral investment treaty based on occidental s belief that the ecuadorian government is arbitrarily and discriminatorily refusing to refund the vat to occidental 
in july  a tribunal of international arbitrators awarded occidental compensation for vat refunds from occidental s block operations that were withheld by the ecuadorian government and indicated that similar vat refunds should be paid going forward 
the ecuadorian government has appealed the tribunal s decision and the appeals proceedings continue at present 
in the event of an unfavorable outcome  the potential effect on occidental s financial statements would not be material 
in september  occidental received formal notification that petroecuador  the state oil company of ecuador  was initiating proceedings to determine if occidental had violated its participation contract for block or the ecuadorian hydrocarbons law and whether the alleged violations constitute grounds for terminating the participation contract 
the principal allegation stated in the notice is an assertion that occidental should have obtained government approval of a farmout agreement entered into in occidental believes that it has complied with all material obligations under the participation contract and ecuadorian law  and that any termination of the contract based upon the stated allegations would be unfounded and would constitute an unlawful expropriation 
occidental is cooperating with the ecuadorian authorities in the current proceedings and will continue to strive for an amicable resolution 
block operations represent approximately percent of occidental s consolidated production  percent of its proved consolidated reserves  and percent of its total property  plant and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization 
production sharing contracts occidental conducts its operations in qatar  oman and yemen under pscs and  under such contracts  receives a share of production to recover its costs and an additional share for profit 
in addition  occidental s share of production from thums is subject to contractual arrangements similar to a psc 
occidental s share of production from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and increases when oil prices decline 
overall  occidental s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices 
proved reserves evaluation and review process a senior corporate officer of occidental is responsible for the internal audit and review of its oil and gas reserves data 
in addition  a corporate reserves review committee the reserves committee has been established  consisting of senior corporate officers  to monitor and review occidental s oil and gas reserves 
the reserves committee reports to the audit committee of occidental s board of directors periodically throughout the year 
occidental has retained ryder scott company  lp ryder scott  independent petroleum engineering consultants  to review its oil and gas estimation processes 
ryder scott has compared occidental s methods and procedures for estimating oil and gas reserves to generally accepted industry standards and has reviewed certain data  methods and procedures used in estimating reserves volumes  the reserve and economic evaluations and reserves classifications 
ryder scott then reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for a selection of oil and gas fields considered to be a valid representation of occidental s total reserves portfolio 
based on this review  including the data  technical processes and interpretations presented by occidental  ryder scott has concluded that the methodologies used by occidental in preparing the relevant estimates generally comply with current securities and exchange commission sec standards 
ryder scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reserves volumes presented by occidental 
proved reserve additions occidental consolidated subsidiaries had proved reserves at year end of  million boe  as compared with the year end amount of  million boe 
additionally  occidental owns investments in other interests which had proved reserves of million and million boe at year end and  respectively 
the increase in the consolidated subsidiaries reserves from all sources was million boe  of which million boe were from proved developed reserves and million boe were from proved undeveloped reserves 
proved developed reserves represent approximately percent of occidental s total proved reserves 
proved reserve additions consolidated subsidiaries proved proved proved in millions of boe developed undeveloped total revisions improved recovery extensions and discoveries purchases total additions proved reserves are percent crude oil and condensate and percent natural gas 
revisions of previous estimates in  occidental added reserves from revisions of previous estimates of million boe  million of which are in the middle east 
the dolphin project added million boe 
these were partially offset by million boe of negative revisions in qatar  yemen and oman  due primarily to the impact of higher oil prices reducing occidental s share of reserves under pscs 
if oil prices increase by per barrel  less oil volume is required to recover costs  and pscs would reduce occidental s share of proved reserves by approximately million boe 
oil price increases would also tend to extend the economic lives for proved reserves from other contracts  which would partially offset these psc reserve volume changes 
conversely  if oil prices drop by per barrel  occidental s share of proved reserves would increase by a similar amount 
the economic lives of other reserves would be shorter  and this would partially offset the psc reserve volume changes 
apart from the effects of product prices  occidental s approach to interpreting technical data regarding oil and gas reserves makes it more likely future reserve revisions will be positive rather than negative 
occidental expects future revisions to be positive as they have been for the last several years 
improved recovery in  occidental added reserves of million boe through improved recovery  mainly in the permian basin  elk hills field  and thums in the united states and also in qatar 
in an effort to partially mitigate the decline in oil and gas production from the elk hills field  from the acquisition in through year end  occidental has successfully implemented an infill drilling program 
the elk hills field employs both gas flood and water flood techniques 
in the permian basin  the increased reserves were primarily attributable to enhanced recovery techniques  such as drilling additional co flood and water flood wells 
in qatar  occidental is currently in the second phase of development under its existing agreement for the isnd field 
this phase targets the development and recovery of additional reserves by applying advance drilling systems and improved reservoir characterization techniques 
extensions and discoveries occidental obtains reserve additions from extensions which are dependent on successful exploitation programs 
in  occidental added reserves of million boe  with million boe in the united states and million boe in ecuador 
in the rocky mountain area  occidental added approximately million boe from the extension of gas reserves to proved locations  most of which will require additional development capital 
in ecuador  occidental continued full development of the eden yuturi oil field in block the success of improved recovery  extension and discovery projects depends on reservoir characteristics and technology improvements  as well as oil and gas prices  capital costs and operating costs 
many of these factors are outside of management s control  and will affect whether or not these historical sources of reserve additions continue at similar levels 
purchases of proved reserves in  occidental purchased reserves of million boe  of which million boe are in latin america and the remainder in the united states 
in april  occidental extended the term of its contract with the government of colombia to the economic life of the cano limon field 
of the million boe of reserve additions  occidental owns million boe and a minority shareholder holds interests in the remaining million boe 
see the oil and gas segment business review latin america colombia section above for a more complete description of this transaction 
the reserve additions of million boe in the united states were from various small acquisitions  primarily in the permian basin  of which percent were proved developed reserves 
occidental continues to add reserves through acquisitions when properties are available at reasonable prices 
acquisitions are dependent on successful bidding and negotiating of oil and gas contracts at attractive terms 
as market conditions change  the available supply of properties may increase or decrease accordingly 
proved undeveloped reserves in  occidental s proved undeveloped reserves increased by million boe 
this net increase resulted from improved recovery  extensions and discoveries  primarily in the elk hills field  in the permian basin  in the rocky mountain area and in the dolphin project 
these proved undeveloped additions were partially offset by reserve transfers to the proved developed category as a result of development programs 
the dolphin project dpsa activity was the largest addition to proved undeveloped reserves in the government of qatar approved the dolphin project final field development plan in december dolphin development progress  including drilling additional wells and constructing platforms  lines  a gas plant and gas compression and pipeline facilities  will continue through an expected start up in for details of proved reserve activity by geographic areas  see the supplemental oil and gas information unaudited section in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
industry outlook the petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to numerous market forces 
crude oil and natural gas prices are affected by market fundamentals such as weather  inventory levels  competing fuel prices  overall demand and the availability of supply 
worldwide oil prices in remained at or near historical highs 
continued economic growth  resulting in increased demand and concerns about supply availability  could result in continued high prices 
a lower demand growth rate could result in lower crude oil prices 
sustained high oil prices will significantly affect profitability and returns for occidental and other upstream producers 
however  the industry has historically experienced wide fluctuations within price cycles 
although oil prices cannot be predicted with any certainty  the wti price has averaged approximately per barrel over the past ten years 
during  occidental experienced an increase in its price differential between the average wti price and occidental s realized prices 
see the oil and gas segment business environment section above for further information 
while supply demand fundamentals are a decisive factor affecting domestic natural gas prices over the long term  day to day prices may be more volatile in the futures markets  such as on the nymex and other exchanges  making it more difficult to forecast prices with any degree of confidence 
over the last ten years  the nymex gas price has averaged per mcf 
chemical segment business environment the chemical segment experienced improved results in due to the continued improvement in most sectors in which oxychem participates  particularly the building and construction markets 
the economic recovery continued its measured growth and the supply demand for major commodities tightened 
product prices were higher but the resulting improvement in profitability was partially offset by higher costs for raw materials  primarily energy and ethylene 
domestic chlorine demand rose nearly percent compared to  as many sectors experienced volume growth 
due to the industry s efforts to improve profitability by reducing capacity  the upturn in demand resulted in industry wide chlor alkali operating rates of percent  the highest since business review chlor alkali demand for chlor alkali products improved throughout with combined chlorine and caustic soda prices rising throughout the second half of the year 
as supply and demand remained tight  prices increased significantly in the latter part of the year  particularly for caustic soda 
oxychem s chlor alkali operating rate for was percent  approximately matching the industry operating rate 
the tight supply demand supported higher chlorine prices  which improved over percent during caustic soda volumes rose with higher demand  especially in the alumina and pulp and paper sectors 
caustic soda prices were highly volatile in as the impact of imports early in the year caused spot realizations to bottom out early in the second quarter 
as demand continued to rise with the improvement of the us manufacturing sector  prices rebounded and increased substantially by year end 
export pricing for caustic soda remained steady through september before rising as the worldwide supply demand balance tightened  exerting upward pressure on pricing 
oxychem maintained its deer park chlor alkali production facility in houston  texas and its edc facility in ingleside  texas in standby mode 
these idle facilities will be reactivated upon strengthening in overall economic conditions that leads to sustained improved demand and higher margins for caustic soda 
in december  oxychem permanently idled a circuit which produced chlorine and caustic soda at its delaware city plant and recorded a pre tax charge of million 
vinyls strong demand and increasing ethylene costs led to pvc price increases in both ethylene and natural gas costs increased in pvc prices increased percent compared to these increases were in addition to the percent increase in pvc resin prices in  which was driven by rising feedstock and energy costs 
industry wide total demand was percent higher compared with oxychem operated its pvc facilities at an average operating rate of percent for  equal to the north american industry average 
exit of vinyl specialty resins business at the end of  occidental decided to exit the vinyl specialty resins business for strategic and economic reasons 
this resulted in the immediate closure of the pottstown  pennsylvania manufacturing facility 
occidental recorded an after tax charge of million in and classified this business as a discontinued operation 
agreement to acquire vulcan assets in october  occidental agreed to purchase three chemical manufacturing facilities from vulcan materials company for million in cash  subject to adjustment for changes in net working capital 
in addition  occidental may become obligated to make contingent payments based upon the future performance of these businesses  and will assume specified obligations 
this transaction  which is subject to regulatory approval  is expected to close in disposition of equistar interest and acquisition of lyondell interest in august  occidental sold its percent share of equistar to lyondell and purchased a percent equity interest in lyondell 
occidental entered into these transactions to diversify its petrochemicals interest 
these transactions reduced occidental s direct exposure to petrochemicals volatility  yet allowed it to preserve  through its lyondell investment  an economic upside of a recovery in the petrochemicals industry 
in connection with these transactions  occidental wrote down its investment in the equistar partnership to fair value by recording a million pre tax charge as of december when this transaction closed in the third quarter of  occidental recorded an after tax gain of million 
in november  lyondell acquired millennium chemicals inc millennium by issuing additional shares of lyondell common stock 
under sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 occidental is required to record its share of the increase in lyondell s net equity resulting from this issuance 
the effect of this is an increase of million in the carrying value of occidental s investment in lyondell and an increase in occidental s net income of million after tax 
at december   occidental owned million shares of lyondell common stock  with a carrying value of million and a fair market value of billion 
as a result of the stock issuance  occidental s ownership percentage of lyondell has decreased from approximately percent to percent 
disposition of chrome and calendering operations in the fourth quarter of  occidental sold its chrome business at castle hayne  north carolina for million and its plastic calendering operations in rio de janeiro  brazil for a million note receivable 
in the third quarter of  occidental recorded an after tax impairment charge of million and classified both of these businesses as discontinued operations 
industry outlook occidental s chemical business improved its profitability in  nearly doubling s earnings levels 
the major factors that contributed to this improved performance are the improved us economy and higher demand for major chemical products 
if operating rates remain at their year end levels and the us economy continues to improve  the chemical industry may experience modest price increases in improved profitability will depend on the amount of increase in future energy and feedstock costs 
construction of lng terminals on the us gulf coast could stabilize natural gas prices at a lower than current level and thereby help improve the competitive position of efficient gulf coast chemical facilities 
however  this construction may not occur in the immediate future 
occidental s chemical business is profitable and is expected to remain profitable if the current favorable economic conditions continue 
if  however  us manufacturing becomes noncompetitive on a worldwide basis  this could shorten the estimated productive lives of some of occidental s plants  resulting in higher annual depreciation 
significantly shorter productive lives could also result in asset impairments  including plant closures 
it is unlikely that any changes in estimated productive lives would be uniform 
while potential impairment charges could have a material impact on the earnings in a discrete period  such changes are unlikely to have a material effect on occidental s overall financial situation 
for additional discussion of the possible financial effect of a change to the productive lives of oxychem s assets  please see the critical accounting policies and estimates section below 
chlor alkali industry operating rates are near historical highs 
demand growth is expected to remain moderate  which will put additional strains on manufacturing capacity 
due to the high volatility of caustic soda prices in  the average price was essentially unchanged from however  the caustic soda markets tightened in the last half of  which may result in increased prices in versus vinyls consensus forecasts for gross domestic product gdp growth of percent suggest expectations for a strong economy that will favorably affect the vinyls business 
overall  oxychem expects to percent growth in vinyls demand in north america in industry wide pvc and vcm operating rates are expected to be slightly lower in as a result of the restart of some idled capacity 
chlorovinyls supply constraints  together with high ethylene costs  have created conditions for vinyls price increases early in pvc resin producers have announced a cents per pound increase for january despite the restart of some idled capacity  vcm supply is expected to be tight due to maintenance requirements and higher global demand for pvc 
average operating rates for north american vcm producers are expected to exceed percent

the higher balance in trade receivables at december   compared to december   reflects higher product prices and crude oil sales volumes during the fourth quarter versus in addition  in june  occidental discontinued the sale of interests in its outstanding receivables balance which had the effect of increasing receivables by million compared to december  the increase in inventories at december   compared to december   is primarily due to higher oil and gas marketing and trading inventory due to higher prices and volumes during the fourth quarter versus the higher balance in the investments in unconsolidated entities at december   compared to december   reflects a note receivable issued to elk hills power  a gain from lyondell s stock issuance and mark to market increases in the available for sale premcor investment 
the increase in the net balance in property  plant and equipment reflects capital expenditures and acquisitions  partially offset by certain asset retirements and dd a expense

liquidity and capital resources financing activity during  occidental strengthened its liquidity position  generating approximately billion in cash from operations 
at december   occidental had approximately billion in cash on hand  an increase of million from although its income and cash flows are largely dependent on oil and gas prices and production  occidental believes that cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its operating needs  capital expenditure requirements  dividend payments and potential acquisitions 
if needed  occidental could access its existing credit facilities 
available but unused lines of committed bank credit totaled approximately billion at december  occidental s billion bank credit matures on june  none of occidental s committed bank credits contain material adverse change mac clauses or debt rating triggers that could restrict occidental s ability to borrow under these lines 
occidental s credit facilities and debt agreements do not contain ratings triggers that could terminate bank commitments or accelerate debt in the event of a ratings downgrade 
at december   under the most restrictive covenants of certain financing agreements  occidental s capacity for additional unsecured borrowing was approximately billion  and the capacity for the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on  and for acquisitions of  occidental s capital stock was approximately billion  assuming that such dividends  distributions and acquisitions were made without incurring additional borrowing 
in january  occidental redeemed all of its outstanding percent trust preferred redeemable securities trust preferred securities at par plus accrued interest  resulting in a decrease in current liabilities of million 
in the third quarter of  occidental redeemed all of its percent senior notes  which reduced long term debt by approximately million 
in july  dolphin energy  the operator of the dolphin project  entered into an agreement with banks to provide a billion bridge loan for the dolphin project 
the loan has a term of five years and is a revolving credit facility for the first two years 
occidental guaranteed percent of the obligations of dolphin energy under the bank agreement 
as part of the financing  a subsidiary of occidental that is an upstream participant in the dolphin project entered into an on loan agreement with dolphin energy to borrow up to million from the proceeds of loans under the facility agreement for its share of upstream costs 
at december   approximately million had been borrowed under this agreement

in march  occidental issued million of percent medium term senior notes and used the proceeds to refinance a portion of the million of senior notes discussed above 
occidental has million of capacity remaining under the shelf registration 
on february   occidental gave notice that it will redeem  out of existing cash on hand  all of its outstanding  percent senior notes due on march  cash flow analysis in millions net cash provided by operating activities    the significant increase in operating cash flow in  compared to  resulted from several factors 
the most important drivers were the significantly higher oil and natural gas prices and  to a much lesser extent  chemical prices 
although the changes in realized prices varied among the regions in which occidental operates  in  occidental s realized oil prices were higher overall by percent 
occidental s realized natural gas price increased over percent in the us  where approximately percent of occidental s natural gas was produced in oil and gas worldwide production  on a boe basis  increased for overall by over percent on a daily basis  as compared with  which also contributed to increased cash flow 
crude oil production was higher in latin america  while natural gas production was higher in the middle east and lower in the us for increases in sales prices realized for occidental s major chemical product lines ranged from zero to percent  compared to chemical prices increased in at a higher rate than the energy driven increase in feedstock and power costs  thereby improving profits and cash flow 
the overall impact of the chemical price changes on cash flow was much less than for oil and gas price changes  not only because the chemical segment earnings and cash flow are significantly smaller than those for the oil and gas segment  but also because of increases in energy price driven feedstock and electric power costs  which are major elements of manufacturing cost for the chemical segment s products 
sales volumes for chemical products generally were higher in  but this did not have a significant effect on occidental s earnings and cash flow 
increases in the costs of producing oil and gas  such as purchased goods and services  particularly materials and oil field services  partially offset oil and gas sales price increases  but such cost increases had a much lower effect on cash flow than the realized price increases 
other cost elements  such as labor costs and overheads  are not significant drivers of cash flow because they are mainly fixed within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term 
the significant increase in operating cash flow in  compared to  resulted from the significantly higher oil and gas prices and  to a much lesser extent  chemical prices 
in  occidental s realized oil prices were higher overall by percent and realized natural gas prices overall were up percent 
oil and gas worldwide production  on a boe basis  increased for overall by approximately percent on a daily basis  as compared with  which also contributed to increased cash flow 
crude oil production was higher overall in the us and latin america  while natural gas production was lower in the us for sales prices realized for occidental s major chemical product lines ranged from percent to percent higher in  compared to chemical prices in also improved at a higher rate than feedstock and power costs increases  thus improving profits and cash flow 
the overall effect of chemical price changes on cash flow was much less than for oil and gas price changes 
sales volumes for chemical products generally were lower in  but this did not have a significant effect on occidental s earnings and cash flow 
increases in the costs of production partially offset sales price increases  but such cost increases had a much lower effect on cash flow than the realized price increases

occidental s capital spending estimate for is approximately billion 
a majority of the capital spending will be allocated to oil and gas  with the main focus on the dolphin project gas exploration and development activity  qatar  elk hills and the permian basin 
in addition  occidental expects to make a further equity investment of about million in dolphin energy 
commitments at december   for major capital expenditures during and thereafter were approximately million 
occidental will fund these commitments and capital expenditures with cash from operations and  as needed  with proceeds from existing credit facilities 
off balance sheet arrangements in the course of its business activities  occidental pursues a number of projects and transactions to meet its core business objectives 
the accounting and financial statement treatment of these transactions is a result of the varying methods of funding employed 
occidental also makes commitments on behalf of unconsolidated entities 
these transactions  or groups of transactions  are recorded in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and  unless otherwise noted  are not reflected on occidental s balance sheets 
the following is a description of the business purpose and nature of these transactions 
dolphin project in july  dolphin energy entered into an agreement with banks to provide a billion bridge loan for the dolphin project 
occidental guaranteed percent of the obligations of dolphin energy under this bank agreement 
see oil and gas segment business review middle east dolphin project and liquidity and capital resources financing activity for further information 
ecuador in ecuador  occidental has a percent interest in the ocp oil export pipeline 
in the second half of  the increased production from the eden yuturi oil field in the southeastern corner of block coincided with the completion of the pipeline 
as of december   occidental contributed and advanced a total of million to the project 
occidental reports this investment in its consolidated statements using the equity method of accounting 
the project was funded in part by senior project debt 
the senior project debt is to be repaid with the proceeds of ship or pay tariffs of certain upstream producers in ecuador  including occidental 
under their ship or pay commitments  occidental and the other upstream producers have each assumed their respective share of project specific risks  including operating risk  political risk and force majeure risk 
occidental would be required to make an advance tariff payment in the event of prolonged force majeure  upstream expropriation events  bankruptcy of the pipeline company or its parent company  abandonment of the project  termination of an investment guarantee agreement with ecuador  or certain defaults by occidental 
this advance tariff would be used by the pipeline company to service or prepay project debt 
at december   occidental s obligation relating to the pipeline company s senior project debt totaled million  and occidental s obligations relating to performance bonds totaled million 
occidental s overall obligations will decrease with the reduction of the pipeline company s senior project debt 
receivables sale program occidental has an agreement in place to sell  under a revolving sale program  an undivided interest in a designated pool of trade receivables 
this program is used by occidental as a low cost source of working capital funding 
the balance of receivables sold at december  and was zero and million  respectively 
the amount is not included in the debt and related trade receivables accounts  respectively  on occidental s consolidated balance sheet 
receivables must meet certain criteria to qualify for the program 
under this program  occidental serves as the collection agent with respect to the receivables sold 
an interest in new receivables is sold as collections are made from customers 
fees and expenses under this program are included in selling  general and administrative and other operating expenses 
the fair value of any retained interests in the receivables sold is not material 
the buyers of the receivables are protected against significant risk of loss on their purchase of receivables 
occidental provides for allowances for any doubtful receivables based on its periodic evaluation of such receivables 
the provisions for such receivables were not material in the years ended december   and although occidental has not sold any receivables under this program since june  the program has not been terminated 
however  the program can terminate upon the occurrence of certain events  which generally are under occidental s control or relate to bankruptcy 
leases occidental has entered into various operating lease agreements  mainly for railcars  power plants  manufacturing facilities and office space 
the leased assets are used in occidental s operations where leasing offers advantages of greater operating flexibility and usually costs less than alternative methods of funding that were available at the time financing decisions were made 
lease payments are expensed mainly as cost of sales 
see contractual obligation table below 
guarantees occidental has entered into various guarantees including performance bonds  letters of credit  indemnities  commitments and other forms of guarantees provided by occidental to third parties  mainly to provide assurance that opc and or its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations guarantees 
at december   the notional amount of the guarantees was approximately million 
of this amount  approximately million relates to occidental s guarantee of equity investees debt and other commitments 
the debt guarantees and other commitments primarily relate to the dolphin energy equity investment and the investment in the ecuador ocp pipeline  which are discussed above 
the remaining million relates to various indemnities and guarantees provided to third parties

c amounts have not been reduced for sublease rental income 
d includes long term purchase contracts and purchase orders and contracts for goods and services used in manufacturing and producing operations in the normal course of business 
some of these arrangements involve take or pay commitments but they do not represent debt obligations 
due to their long term nature  purchase contracts with terms greater than years are discounted using a percent discount rate 
e amounts do not include purchase obligations related to oil and gas marketing and trading activities where an offsetting sales position exists 
lawsuits  claims  commitments  contingencies and related matters opc and certain of its subsidiaries have been named in a substantial number of lawsuits  claims and other legal proceedings 
these actions seek  among other things  compensation for alleged personal injury  breach of contract  property damage  punitive damages  civil penalties or other losses  or injunctive or declaratory relief 
opc and certain of its subsidiaries also have been named in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla and similar federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws 
these environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and  in some cases  compensation for alleged property damage  punitive damages and civil penalties  however  occidental is usually one of many companies in these proceedings and has to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies 
with respect to all such lawsuits  claims and proceedings  including environmental proceedings  occidental accrues reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
during the course of its operations  occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal  state  local and foreign tax jurisdictions 
taxable years prior to are closed for us federal income tax purposes 
taxable years through are in various stages of audit by the internal revenue service 
disputes arise during the course of such audits as to facts and matters of law 
occidental has been in continuing tax audit settlement discussions with the internal revenue service on issues related to foreign tax credits and various domestic income issues for the to audit years 
occidental believes that it is reasonably possible that substantive issues for taxable years to could be favorably resolved during and that such resolutions  if they occur  could have a positive and material effect on its results of operations and its financial condition  however  occidental believes such resolutions will not have a significant cash effect 
occidental has entered into agreements providing for future payments to secure terminal and pipeline capacity  drilling services  electrical power  steam and certain chemical raw materials 
see note of the audited financial statements for further discussion 
occidental has certain other commitments under contracts  guarantees and joint ventures  and certain other contingent liabilities 
many of these commitments  although not fixed or determinable  involve capital expenditures and are part of the billion capital expenditures estimated for occidental has indemnified various parties against specified liabilities that those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with occidental 
these indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds 
as of december   occidental is not aware of circumstances that would lead to future indemnity claims against it for material amounts in connection with these transactions 
it is impossible at this time to determine the ultimate liabilities that opc and its subsidiaries may incur resulting from any lawsuits  claims and proceedings  audits  commitments  contingencies and related matters 
if these matters were to be ultimately resolved unfavorably at amounts substantially exceeding occidental s reserves  an outcome not currently anticipated  it is possible that such outcome could have a material adverse effect upon occidental s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
however  after taking into account reserves  management does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these matters to have a material adverse effect upon occidental s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
environmental liabilities and expenditures occidental s operations in the united states are subject to stringent federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to improving or maintaining environmental quality 
foreign operations also are subject to environmental protection laws 
costs associated with environmental compliance have increased over time and are expected to rise in the future 
environmental expenditures related to current operations are factored into the overall business planning process and are considered an integral part of production in manufacturing quality products responsive to market demand 
environmental remediation the laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively to past waste disposal practices and releases 
in many cases  the laws apply regardless of fault  legality of the original activities or current ownership or control of sites 
opc or certain of its subsidiaries are currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups under these laws at federal superfund sites  comparable state sites and other domestic and foreign remediation sites  including occidental facilities and previously owned sites 
also  opc and certain of its subsidiaries have been involved in a substantial number of governmental and private proceedings involving historical practices at various sites including  in some instances  having been named in proceedings under cercla and similar federal  state and local environmental laws 
these proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and  in some cases  compensation for alleged property damage  punitive damages and civil penalties 
occidental manages its environmental remediation efforts through a wholly owned subsidiary  glenn springs holdings  inc  which reports its results directly to occidental s corporate management 
the following table presents occidental s environmental remediation reserves at december   and grouped by three categories of environmental remediation sites amounts in millions of reserve of reserve of reserve sites balance sites balance sites balance cercla equivalent sites active facilities closed or sold facilities total the following table shows environmental reserve activity for the past three years in millions balance beginning of year increases to provision including interest accretion changes from acquisitions payments other balance end of year occidental expects to expend funds equivalent to about half of the current environmental reserve over the next three years and the balance over the next ten or more years 
occidental expects that it may continue to incur additional liabilities beyond those recorded for environmental remediation at these and other sites 
the range of reasonably possible loss for existing environmental remediation matters could be up to million beyond the amount accrued 
for management s opinion  refer to the lawsuits  claims  commitments  contingencies and related matters section above 
cercla and equivalent sites at december   opc or certain of its subsidiaries have been named in cercla or state equivalent proceedings  as shown below 
reserve description amounts in millions of sites balance minimal no exposure a reserves between mm reserves over mm total a includes sites for which maxus energy corporation has retained the liability and indemnified occidental  sites where occidental has denied liability without challenge  sites where occidental s reserves are less than  each  and sites where reserves are between  and million each 
the seven sites with individual reserves over million in are a former copper mining and smelting operation in tennessee  two closed landfills in western new york  groundwater treatment facilities at three currently closed or formerly owned chemical plants montague  michigan  western new york and tacoma  washington and replacement of a municipal drinking water treatment plant in western new york 
active facilities certain subsidiaries of opc are currently addressing releases of substances from past operations at active facilities 
four facilities certain oil and gas properties in the southwestern united states  a chemical plant in louisiana  a chemical plant in texas  and a phosphorous recovery operation in tennessee account for percent of the reserves associated with these facilities 
closed or sold facilities there are sites formerly owned or operated by certain subsidiaries of opc that have ongoing environmental remediation requirements in which occidental or its subsidiaries are involved 
three sites account for percent of the reserves associated with this group 
the three sites are an active refinery in louisiana where occidental indemnifies the current owner and operator for certain remedial actions  a water treatment facility at a former coal mine in pennsylvania  and a former oxychem chemical plant in ohio operated by new ownership 
environmental costs occidental s costs  some of which may include estimates  relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations  are shown below for each segment in millions operating expenses oil and gas chemical capital expenditures oil and gas chemical remediation expenses corporate operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis 
capital expenditures relate to longer lived improvements in currently operating facilities 
remediation expenses relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and do not contribute to current or future revenue generation 
although total costs may vary in any one year  over the long term  segment operating and capital expenditures for environmental compliance generally are expected to increase 
occidental presently estimates that capital expenditures for environmental compliance will be approximately million for and million for foreign investments portions of occidental s assets outside north america are exposed to political and economic risks 
occidental conducts its financial affairs so as to mitigate its exposure against those risks 
at december   the carrying value of occidental s assets in countries outside north america aggregated approximately billion  or approximately percent of occidental s total assets at that date 
of such assets  approximately billion are located in the middle east  approximately million are located in latin america  and substantially all of the remainder are located in pakistan 
for the year ended december   net sales outside north america totaled billion  or approximately percent of total net sales 
critical accounting policies and estimates the process of preparing financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the management of occidental to make estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions 
it is possible that materially different amounts could be recorded if these estimates and judgments change or if the actual results differ from these estimates and judgments 
occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve the judgment of occidental s management 
there has been no material change to these policies over the past three years 
the selection and development of these critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
oil and gas properties occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties 
under this method  costs of acquiring properties  costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs are capitalized 
the costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found 
at the completion of drilling activities  the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized if a determination is made that proved reserves have been found 
if no proved reserves have been found  the costs of each of the related exploratory wells are charged to expense 
in some cases  a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling  requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells 
occidental s practice is to expense the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a twelve month period after drilling is complete 
occidental has no oil and gas reserves for which the determination of commercial viability is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures 
annual lease rentals  exploration costs  geological  geophysical and seismic costs are expensed as incurred 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty can be recovered in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions considering future production and development costs 
there are several factors that could change occidental s recorded oil and gas reserves 
occidental receives a share of production from pscs to recover its costs and an additional share for profit 
occidental s share of production from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and increases when oil prices decline 
overall  occidental s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices 
in other contractual arrangements  sustained lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of proved reserves becomes uneconomical 
estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond occidental s control  such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs 
these factors  in turn  could lead to a reduction in the quantity of recorded proved reserves 
pscs also affect reserves 
as prices increase  occidental s share of proved recorded reserves decreases while a decrease in price causes recorded proved reserves to increase 
see the oil and gas segment proved reserves additions section above for further information 
an additional factor that could result in a change of proved reserves is the reservoir decline rates being different from those assumed when the reserves were initially recorded 
overall  occidental s revisions to proved reserves were positive for  and and amounted to less than percent of the total reserves for each year 
additionally  occidental is required to perform impairment tests pursuant to sfas no 
generally when prices decline and or reserve estimates change significantly 
there have been no impairments of reserves over the past three years 
depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties is determined by the unit of production method and could change with revisions to estimated proved recoverable reserves 
the change in the depreciation and depletion rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous reserve estimates has been immaterial 
if occidental s consolidated oil and gas reserves were to change based on the factors mentioned above  the most significant impact would be on the depreciation and depletion rate 
for example  a percent increase in the amount of consolidated oil and gas reserves would change the rate from per barrel to per barrel  which would increase pre tax income by million annually 
a percent decrease in the oil and gas reserves would change the rate from per barrel to per barrel and would result in a decrease in pre tax income of million annually 
a portion of the carrying value of occidental s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties 
at december   the costs attributable to unproved properties were approximately million 
these costs are not currently being depreciated or depleted 
as exploration and development work progresses and the reserves on these properties are proven  capitalized costs attributable to the properties will be subject to depreciation and depletion 
if the exploration and development work were to be unsuccessful  the capitalized costs of the properties related to this unsuccessful work would be expensed in the year in which the determination was made 
the timing of any writedowns of these unproven properties  if warranted  depends upon the nature  timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results 
occidental believes its exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize the unproved property balance 
chemical assets the most critical accounting policy affecting occidental s chemical assets is the determination of the estimated useful lives of its property  plant and equipment 
occidental s chemical plants are depreciated using either the unit of production or straight line method based upon the estimated useful life of the facilities 
the estimated useful lives of occidental s chemical assets  which range from years to years  are used to compute depreciation expense and are also used for impairment tests 
the estimated useful lives used for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained 
without these continued expenditures  the useful lives of these plants could significantly decrease 
other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of occidental s chemical plants include higher or lower product prices  which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition  feedstock costs  energy prices  environmental regulations  competition and technological changes 
occidental is required to perform impairment tests on its assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  or when management s plans change with respect to those assets 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 occidental must compare the undiscounted future cash flows of an asset to its carrying value 
the key factors that could significantly affect future cash flows are future product prices  which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition  feedstock costs  energy costs  significantly increased regulation and remaining estimated useful life 
due to a temporary decrease in demand for some of its products  occidental temporarily idled an edc plant in june and a chlor alkali plant in december these idle facilities will be reactivated upon strengthening in overall economic conditions that leads to sustained improved demand and higher margins for caustic soda 
management expects that these plants will become operational in the future 
the net book value of these plants was million at december  based on year end value  the chlor alkali plant that closed on december  has a percent minority interest of million 
these facilities are periodically tested for impairment and  based on the results  no impairment is deemed necessary at this time 
occidental continues to depreciate these facilities based on their remaining estimated useful lives 
over the prior three years  the change in the depreciation rate due to changes in estimated useful lives has been immaterial 
occidental s net property  plant and equipment for chemicals is approximately billion and its depreciation expense for is expected to be approximately million 
if the estimated useful lives of occidental s chemical plants were to decrease based on the factors mentioned above  the most significant impact would be on depreciation expense 
for example  a reduction in the remaining useful lives of percent would increase depreciation and reduce pre tax earnings by approximately million per year 
environmental liabilities and expenditures environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate 
reserves for estimated costs that relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future revenue generation are recorded when environmental remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
in determining the reserves and the reasonably possible range of loss  occidental refers to currently available information  including relevant past experience  available technology  regulations in effect  the timing of remediation and cost sharing arrangements 
the environmental reserves are based on management s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred and are reviewed periodically and adjusted as additional or new information becomes available 
environmental reserves are recorded on a discounted basis only when a reserve is initially established and the aggregate amount of the estimated costs for a specific site and the timing of cash payments are reliably determinable 
the reserve methodology for a specific site is not modified once it has been established 
recoveries and reimbursements are recorded in income when receipt is probable 
for the years ended december  and  occidental has not accrued any reimbursements or indemnification recoveries for environmental remediation matters as assets 
many factors could result in changes to occidental s environmental reserves and reasonably possible range of loss 
the most significant are the original cost estimate may have been inaccurate 
modified remedial measures might be necessary to achieve the required remediation results 
occidental generally assumes that the remedial objective can be achieved using the most cost effective technology reasonably expected to achieve that objective 
such technologies may include air sparging or phyto remediation of shallow groundwater  or limited surface soil removal or in situ treatment producing acceptable risk assessment results 
should such remedies fail to achieve remedial objectives  more intensive or costly measures may be required 
the remedial measure might take more or less time than originally anticipated to achieve the required contaminant reduction 
site specific time estimates can be affected by factors such as groundwater capture rates  anomalies in subsurface geology  interactions between or among water bearing zones and non water bearing zones  or the ability to identify and control contaminant sources 
the regulatory agency might ultimately reject or modify occidental s proposed remedial plan and insist upon a different course of action 
additionally  other events might occur that could affect occidental s future remediation costs  such as the discovery of more extensive contamination than had been originally anticipated 
for some sites with impacted groundwater  accurate definition of contaminant plumes requires years of monitoring data and computer modeling 
migration of contaminants may follow unexpected pathways along geologic anomalies that could initially go undetected 
additionally  the size of the area requiring remediation may change based upon risk assessment results following site characterization or interim remedial measures 
improved remediation technology might decrease the cost of remediation 
in particular  for groundwater remediation sites with projected long term operation and maintenance  the development of more effective treatment technology  or acceptance of alternative and more cost effective treatment methodologies such as bioremediation  could significantly affect remediation costs 
laws and regulations might change to impose more or less stringent remediation requirements 
at sites involving multiple parties  occidental provides environmental reserves based upon its expected share of liability 
when other parties are jointly liable  the financial viability of the parties  the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to occidental of their failure to participate are evaluated when estimating occidental s ultimate share of liability 
based on these factors  occidental believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of other potentially responsible parties  with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable  in an amount that would have a material effect on occidental s consolidated financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
most cost sharing arrangements with other parties fall into one of the following three categories category cercla or state equivalent sites wherein occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties share the cost of remediation in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations  category oil and gas joint ventures wherein each joint venture partner pays its proportionate share of remedial cost  and category contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and sales of property wherein the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating the costs of environmental remediation 
in all three of these categories  occidental records as a reserve its expected net cost of remedial activities  as adjusted by recognition for any nonperforming parties 
in addition to the costs of investigating and implementing remedial measures  which often take in excess of ten years at cercla sites  occidental s reserves include management s estimates of the cost of operation and maintenance of remedial systems 
to the extent that the remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site specific data  laws  regulations  technologies or engineering estimates  occidental reviews and changes the reserves accordingly on a site specific basis 
if the environmental reserve balance were to either increase or decrease based on the factors mentioned above  the amount of the increase or decrease would be immediately recognized in earnings 
for example  if the reserve balance were to decrease by percent  occidental would record a pre tax gain of million 
if the reserve balance were to increase by percent  occidental would record an additional remediation expense of million 
other loss contingencies occidental is involved with numerous lawsuits  claims  proceedings and audits in the normal course of its operations 
occidental records a loss contingency for these matters when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
in addition  occidental discloses  in aggregate  its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred 
occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis so that they are adequately reserved on the balance sheet 
these reserves are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate 
management s judgments could change based on new information  changes in laws or regulations  changes in management s plans or intentions  the outcome of legal proceedings  settlements or other factors 
significant accounting changes listed below are significant changes in occidental s accounting principles 
sfas no 
in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes accounting standards for how a company classifies and measures financial instruments that have characteristics of liabilities and equity 
occidental adopted the provisions of this statement on july  as a result of the adoption  occidental s mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities were classified as a liability and the payments to the holders of the securities were recorded as interest expense 
on january   all of the trust preferred securities were redeemed 
fin and fin r revised in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities vie 
fin requires a company to consolidate a vie if it is designated as the primary beneficiary of that entity even if the company does not have a majority of voting interests 
a vie is generally defined as an entity whose equity is unable to finance its activities or whose owners lack the risks and rewards of ownership 
the statement also imposes disclosure requirements for all the vies of a company  even if the company is not the primary beneficiary 
the provisions of this statement apply at inception for any entity created after january  occidental adopted the provisions of this interpretation for its existing entities on april   which resulted in the consolidation of its oxymar investment 
as a result of the oxymar consolidation  assets increased by million and liabilities increased by million 
there was no material effect on net income as a result of the consolidation 
in april  marubeni exercised its option to put its interest in oxymar to occidental by paying approximately million to occidental 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information on vies where occidental is not the primary beneficiary 
in december  the fasb revised fin to exempt certain entities from its requirements and to clarify certain issues arising during the initial implementation of fin occidental adopted the revised interpretation in the first quarter of and it did not have a material impact on the financial statements when adopted 
eitf issue no 
in the third quarter of  occidental adopted certain provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
these provisions prescribed significant changes in how revenue from energy trading is recorded 
historically  occidental had two major types of oil and gas revenues revenues from its equity production  and revenues from the sale of oil and gas produced by other companies  but purchased and resold by occidental  referred to as revenue from trading activities 
both types of sales involve physical deliveries and had been historically recorded on a gross basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
with the adoption of eitf issue no 
 occidental now reflects the revenue from trading activities on a net basis 
there were no changes in gross margins  net income  cash flow or earnings per share for any period as a result of adopting this requirement 
however  net sales and cost of sales were reduced by equal and offsetting amounts to reflect the adoption of this requirement 
for the year ended december   net sales and cost of sales were reduced from amounts previously reported by approximately billion representing amounts for the first two quarters of to conform to the current presentation 
from to  occidental accounted for certain energy trading contracts in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
eitf issue no 
required that all energy trading contracts must be marked to fair value with gains and losses included in earnings  whether the contracts were derivatives or not 
in october  the eitf rescinded eitf issue no 
 thus precluding mark to market accounting for all energy trading contracts that are not derivatives and fair value accounting for inventories purchased from third parties 
also  the rescission requires derivative gains and losses to be presented net on the income statement  whether or not they are physically settled  if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes 
occidental adopted this accounting change in the first quarter of and recorded an million after tax charge as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles 
sfas no 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
under sfas no 
 companies are required to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which the liability is incurred if there is a legal obligation to dismantle the asset and reclaim or remediate the property at the end of its useful life 
occidental adopted sfas no 
in the first quarter of the initial adoption resulted in an after tax charge of million  which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles 
the adoption increased net property  plant and equipment by million  increased asset retirement obligations by million and decreased deferred tax liabilities by million 
the pro forma asset retirement obligation  if the adoption of this statement had occurred on january   would have been million at january  and million at december  sfas no 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
changes the accounting and reporting requirements for acquired goodwill and intangible assets 
the provisions of this statement are applied to companies starting with fiscal years beginning after december  at december   the balance sheet included approximately million of goodwill and intangible assets with annual amortization expense of approximately million recorded in each of the years income statements for the three year period ended december  as a result  elimination of goodwill amortization would not have had a material impact on net income or earnings per share of any of the years presented and  as a result  the transitional disclosures of adjusted net income excluding goodwill amortization described by sfas no 
have not been presented 
upon implementation of sfas no 
in the first quarter of  three separate specialty chemical businesses were identified as separate reporting units and tested for goodwill impairment 
all three of these businesses are components of the chemical segment 
the fair value of each of the three reporting units was determined through third party appraisals 
the appraisals determined fair value to be the price that the assets could be sold for in a current transaction between willing parties 
as a result of the impairment testing  occidental recorded a cumulative after tax effect of changes in accounting principles reduction in net income of approximately million due to the impairment of all the goodwill attributed to these reporting units 
derivative activities and market risk general occidental s market risk exposures relate primarily to commodity prices and  to a lesser extent  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
occidental periodically enters into derivative instrument transactions to reduce these price and rate fluctuations 
a derivative is an instrument that  among other characteristics  derives its value from changes in another instrument or variable 
in general  the fair value recorded for derivative instruments is based on quoted market prices  dealer quotes and the black scholes or similar valuation models 
commodity price risk general occidental s results are sensitive to fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices 
based on current levels of production  if oil prices vary overall by per barrel  it would have an estimated quarterly effect on income of approximately million before us income taxes 
if natural gas prices vary by per mcf  it would have an estimated quarterly effect on income of approximately million before us income taxes 
if production levels change in the future  the sensitivity of occidental s results to oil and gas prices also would change 
occidental s results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices 
if chlorine and caustic soda prices vary by ton  it would have approximately a million and million  respectively  annual effect on income before us income taxes 
if pvc prices vary by 
lb  it would have approximately a million annual effect on income before us income taxes 
if edc prices vary by ton  it would have approximately a million annual effect on income before us income taxes 
historically  price changes either precede or follow raw material and feedstock price changes  therefore  the margin improvement of price changes can be mitigated 
according to chemical market associates  inc  december average contract prices were chlorine ton  caustic soda ton  pvc lb and edc ton 
marketing and trading operations occidental periodically uses different types of derivative instruments to achieve the best prices for oil and gas 
derivatives are also used by occidental to reduce its exposure to price volatility and to mitigate fluctuations in commodity related cash flows 
occidental enters into low risk marketing and trading activities through its separate marketing organization  which operates under established policy controls and procedures 
with respect to derivatives used in its oil and gas marketing operations  occidental utilizes a combination of futures  forwards  options and swaps to offset various physical transactions 
occidental s use of derivatives in hedging marketing and trading activities relates primarily to managing cash flows from third party purchases 
risk management occidental conducts its risk management activities for energy commodities which include buying  selling  marketing  trading  and hedging activities under the controls and governance of its risk management policy 
the chief financial officer and the risk management committee  comprising members of occidental s management  oversee these controls  which are implemented and enforced by the trading control officer 
the trading control officer provides an independent and separate check on results of marketing and trading activities 
controls for energy commodities include limits on credit  limits on trading  segregation of duties  delegation of authority and a number of other policy and procedural controls 
fair value of marketing and trading derivative contracts the following tables reconcile the changes in the fair value of occidental s marketing and trading contracts during and and segregate the open contracts at december  by maturity periods 
in millions fair value of contracts outstanding at beginning of year gains losses on changes for contracts realized or otherwise settled during the year changes in fair value attributable to changes in valuation techniques and assumptions gains losses or other changes in fair value fair value of contracts outstanding at end of year maturity periods source of and total fair value to to thereafter fair value prices actively quoted prices provided by other external sources prices based on models and other valuation methods total production hedges on a limited basis  occidental uses cash flow hedges for the sale of crude oil and natural gas production 
no cash flow hedges were used for the sale of production in and no material amounts were used during there were no material crude oil or gas cash flow hedges on future production at december  no fair value hedges were used for oil and gas production during or quantitative information occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commodity based derivatives and commodity contracts used in marketing and trading activities 
this method determines the maximum potential negative short term change in fair value with a percent level of confidence 
the marketing and trading value at risk was immaterial during all of interest rate risk general occidental s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to its long term debt obligations 
to reduce its interest rate risk  occidental has entered into several interest rate swaps that effectively convert approximately billion of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt with maturities ranging from to tabular presentation of interest rate risk in millions of us dollars  except rates the table below provides information about occidental s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps and debt obligations 
interest rate swaps are presented at fair value and by maturity date 
debt amounts represent principal payments by maturity date 
usdollar us dollar year of fixed rate interest rate variable rate maturity debt swaps debt grand total a thereafter   total    average interest rate fair value    a excludes million of unamortized debt discounts 
credit risk occidental s energy contracts are spread among several counterparties 
creditworthiness is reviewed before doing business with a new counterparty and on an ongoing basis 
occidental monitors aggregated counterparty exposure relative to credit limits  and manages credit enhancement issues 
credit exposure for each customer is monitored for outstanding balances  current month activity  and forward mark to market exposure 
foreign currency risk several of occidental s foreign operations are located in countries whose currencies generally depreciate against the us dollar 
typically  effective currency forward markets do not exist for these countries 
therefore  occidental attempts to manage its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions only at levels necessary for operating purposes 
most international crude oil sales are denominated in us dollars 
additionally  all of occidental s oil and gas foreign entities have the us dollar as the functional currency 
at december  and  occidental had not entered into any foreign currency derivative instruments 
the effect of exchange rate transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income 
safe harbor discussion regarding outlook and other forward looking data portions of this report  including items and and the information appearing under the caption management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  including the information under the sub captions strategy  oil and gas segment industry outlook  and chemical segment industry outlook  contain forward looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results of operations  liquidity  cash flows and business prospects 
words such as estimate  project  predict  will  anticipate  plan  intend  believe  expect or similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes generally identify forward looking statements 
occidental expressly disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information or otherwise 
factors that could cause results to differ materially from forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  those listed below external risks volatile global commodity pricing fluctuations beyond occidental s control strongly affect its revenues  profitability  operating cash flow and future growth rate 
as discussed in the section entitled derivative activities and market risk commodity price risk production hedges  occidental typically does not hedge against price fluctuations in either of its businesses with the result that its financial results correlate closely to the price it obtains for its products in the global markets in which they compete 
historically  prices for occidental s products have been volatile 
in addition  a significant portion of the oil occidental produces is sour crude  which has tended to experience lower rates of price increase because there is comparatively more sour crude oil available 
drilling and exploration activity levels  inventory levels  production disruptions  the actions of opec increasing prices or limiting occidental s production  price speculation and geophysical and technical limitations affect the global short term and long term supply of oil and gas and interact to contribute to price volatility 
because of the long lead times associated with drilling and exploration projects  occidental may commit significant amounts of capital to oil and gas projects and cannot be certain of the level of demand that will exist when it finishes a project 
the health of the global economy  alternative sources of energy  such as coal  and efforts at efficient consumption can also affect the demand for oil and gas 
demand for occidental s chemicals products correlates most strongly with the health of the global economy 
occidental also depends on feedstocks and energy to produce chemicals  both of which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations 
occidental s businesses operate in a highly competitive environment 
occidental s future oil and gas production depends on its ability to acquire or find additional reserves at prices below that at which it can sell the oil and gas it produces from them  after operating costs 
occidental can acquire reserves by purchasing existing producing assets or by acquiring exploration rights and successfully drilling wells that produce hydrocarbons in commercial quantities 
industry competition for reserves may cause occidental to shift toward higher risk exploration activity or force it to pay more for acquisitions 
rising exploration and development activity in the industry generally increases the costs of oil and gas services 
participants in the chemicals industry compete primarily based on price and the industry consists of many domestic and foreign competitors 
in addition  the industry has been characterized by sporadic global expansion  often leading to overcapacity  whenever currently foreseeable prices appear to support expansion  which has often led to overcapacity 
in both industries  occidental uses nonproprietary technology and business management techniques  which limits its ability to achieve significant comparative production efficiencies 
occidental s businesses may experience catastrophic occurrences 
natural disasters  such as hurricanes  occur regularly and may occasionally affect occidental s businesses 
in addition  well blowouts and oilfield fires  armed conflicts  civil unrest and industrial accidents may occur and may have an effect on occidental s businesses 
occidental maintains insurance against a number of these risks  however  it partially self insures and insurance may not always provide the coverage expected or desired due to contractual limitations  unavailability  cost of insurance and the insurers financial health 
varied governmental and political actions affect occidental s results of operations 
the transnational character of occidental s oil and gas business subjects it to the decisions of many governments and political interests 
as a result  occidental faces increased risks of change in laws and regulations  including  but not limited to  those related to taxes  royalty rates  permitted production rates  import  export and use of products  and environmental protection  as well as risk of expropriation or reduction of entitlements to produce hydrocarbons 
occidental operates some of its oil and gas business in countries that occasionally experience political instability  which increases occidental s risk of loss or delayed production associated with armed conflict  civil unrest  security problems  restrictions on production equipment imports and sanctions that prevent continued operations 
occidental may face the risk of increased costs if it is perceived not to be respecting or advancing the economic and social progress of the communities in which it operates 
since occidental s assets are long lived  the magnitude of these risks can vary during the time it operates in a country 
certain of occidental s major chemicals products are coproduced in a fixed ratio  which limits its ability to exploit pricing opportunities 
because chlorine and caustic soda must be produced together in a fixed ratio  an imbalance in demand between the products ultimately requires occidental to reduce output or cut prices to restore demand balance 
either action in turn limits occidental s profits on these commodities 
technological changes may change the nature of the energy industry 
rising oil and gas prices create incentives to find alternative energy sources that could replace oil and gas over the long term 
internal risks occidental may incur significant costs in exploration or development efforts which may prove unsuccessful or unprofitable 
occidental may misinterpret geologic or engineering data  which may result in significant losses on unsuccessful exploration or development drilling efforts 
occidental is subject to the risks of project delays and cost overruns due to unexpected geologic conditions  equipment failures and accidents  adverse weather and construction or start up delays and other associated risks 
inadequate cost containment could reduce occidental s competitiveness 
occidental works to minimize the costs associated with its businesses but the impact of its efforts may not be sufficient to offset any negative effects related to the main elements of cost  which consist of reserve acquisition costs for oil and gas and feedstock and energy costs for chemicals
