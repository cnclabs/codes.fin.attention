item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other portions of this annual report on form k contain certain forward looking statements concerning the future operations of the company 
management desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and is including this statement for the express purpose of availing the company of the protections of such safe harbor with respect to all forward looking statements contained in its annual report 
the company has used forward looking statements to describe future plans and strategies  including expectations of the company s future financial results 
management s ability to predict results or the effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain 
factors which could affect the results include interest rate trends  the general economic climate in the bank s market area and the country as a whole  the real estate market in washington  idaho and oregon  the demand for mortgage loans  the ability of the company to control costs and expenses  competition and pricing  loan delinquency rates  and changes in federal and state regulation 
these factors should be considered in evaluating the forward looking statements  and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements 
the company does not undertake to update any forward looking statements 
the profitability of the company s operations depends primarily on its net interest income  its non interest income principally from loan origination fees and transaction account service charges and its non interest expense 
net interest income is the difference between the income the company receives on its loan and investment portfolio and its cost of funds  which consists of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is a function of the company s interest rate spread  which is the difference between the yield earned on interest earning assets and the rate paid on total deposits and borrowed funds  as well as a function of the average balance of interest earning assets as compared to the average balance of total deposits on borrowed funds 
non interest income is comprised of income from mortgage banking activities  transaction service charge fees  gain on the occasional sale of assets and miscellaneous fees and income 
mortgage banking generates income from the sale of mortgage loans and from servicing fees on loans serviced for others 
the contribution of mortgage banking activities to the company s results of operations is highly dependent on the demand for loans by borrowers and investors  and therefore the amount of gain on sale of loans may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in market interest rates and the local and national economy 
the company s profitability is also affected by the level of non interest expense 
non interest expenses include compensation and benefits  occupancy and maintenance expenses  deposit insurance premiums  data servicing expenses  advertising expenses  supplies and postage  and other operating costs 
additional expenses that were incurred in fiscal year include establishing new loan production office in nampa  idaho and new branches in boise and hayden  idaho  conversion deconversion costs for the core system  integration and enhancements to security of the wide area network computing systems  and some consulting fees for compliance with the certification provisions regarding internal controls required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  including federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia certifications on management s assessments on internal controls 
additional expenses that are expected to be incurred in fiscal year include constructing and opening a second full service branch in boise  idaho and consulting fees for addition sarbanes oxley act and fdicia compliance 
the company s results of operations may be adversely affected during periods of reduced loan demand to the extent that non interest expenses associated with mortgage banking activities are not reduced commensurate with the decrease in loan originations

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that reflect significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
not all of these critical accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however  management believes that the following policies and those disclosed could be considered critical within the sec s definition 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies upon which our financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments are as follows allowance for loan losses 
arriving at an appropriate level of reserve for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment 
the provision for loan losses is based upon management s ongoing review and evaluation and the board of directors regular review of the loan portfolio and consideration of economic conditions which may affect the ability of borrowers to repay their loans on a monthly basis 
a loan loss grading system assists management in determining the overall risk in the loan portfolio 
individual loans are reviewed periodically for classification into six categories satisfactory  acceptable  special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss  and are assigned a standard loan loss percentage 
the change in loan types per category is multiplied by the assigned loan loss percentage to arrive at the basic monthly adjustment to the provision for loan loss 
the second element of the provision for loan losses is based on management s review and evaluation of the allowance for loan losses based on an analysis of historical trends  individual loans for which full collectibility may not be reasonably assured  estimated fair value of the underlying collateral  industry comparisons  unemployment rate in the bank s market  and inherent risks in the bank s portfolio 
the reserve may be affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  which may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen 
the reserve is increased by provisions for loan losses and by recoveries of loans previously charged off and reduced by loans charged off 
mortgage servicing rights msrs 
determination of the fair value of msrs requires the estimation of multiple interdependent variables  the most important of which is mortgage prepayment speeds 
prepayment speeds are estimates of the pace and magnitude of future mortgage payoff or refinance behavior of customers whose loans are serviced by the bank 
at least quarterly  the company engages a qualified third party to provide an estimate of the fair value of msrs using a discounted cash flow model with assumptions and estimates based upon observable market based data and methodology common to the mortgage servicing market 
management believes the model applies reasonable assumptions under the circumstances  however  because of possible volatility in the market price of msrs  and the vagaries of any relatively illiquid market  there can be no assurance that risk management and existing accounting practices will prevent impairment charges in future periods 
the cost of mortgage servicing rights is amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated net servicing revenues 
impairment of mortgage servicing rights is assessed based on the fair value of those rights 
fair values are estimated using prices for similar assets with similar characteristics  when available  or based upon discounted cash flows using market based assumptions 
for purposes of measuring impairment  the rights are stratified by predominant characteristics  such as interest rates and terms 
the amount of impairment recognized is the amount by which the capitalized mortgage servicing rights for a stratum exceeds their fair value 
securities 
estimates are used in the presentation of the securities portfolio and these estimates impact the company s financial condition and results of operations 
many of the securities included in the securities portfolio are purchased at a premium or discount 
the premiums or discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the security 
for mortgage related securities  including collateralized mortgage obligations cmos  the amortization or accretion is based on estimated lives of the securities 
the lives of the securities can fluctuate based on the amount of prepayments received on the underlying collateral of the securities 
the company uses estimates for the lives of these mortgage related securities based on information provided by third parties 
the company adjusts the rate of amortization or accretion regularly to reflect changes in the estimated lives of these securities 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
analysis of the fair value of recorded goodwill for impairment involves a substantial amount of judgment  as well as establishing and monitoring estimated lives of other amortizable intangible assets 
the company has goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of business combinations 
the company adopted financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets effective january  in accordance with this standard  goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives are no longer being amortized but instead will be tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
management has completed impairment testing for the company s intangibles with indefinite lives and determined that there was no impairment

asset and liability management the company s principal financial objective is to achieve long term profitability while reducing its exposure to fluctuating interest rates 
the company has sought to reduce exposure of its earnings to changes in market interest rates by attempting to manage the mismatch between asset and liability maturities and interest rates 
the principal element in achieving this objective is to increase the interest rate sensitivity of the company s interest earning assets by retaining for its portfolio shorter term loans and loans with interest rates subject to periodic adjustment to market conditions and by selling substantially all of its longer term  fixed rate residential mortgage loans 
the company has historically relied on retail deposits as its primary source of funds 
however  because loan growth has exceeded that of deposits  fhlb advances and brokered cds have been used to fund the loan growth 
management believes retail core deposits  compared to brokered and cd deposits  reduce the effects of interest rate fluctuations because they generally represent a more stable source of funds 
as part of its interest rate risk management strategy  the company promotes non interest bearing transaction accounts  interest bearing accounts  money market accounts  and certificates of deposit with longer maturities up to five years to reduce the interest sensitivity of its interest bearing liabilities 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the on going monitoring and management of the risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process  which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset liability management policies to the asset liability committee alco 
in this capacity  alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting the company s asset liability management related activities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels trends

the data processing  automated teller machine  merchant bank card  and visa credit card expense  which include these contracts  was million for the year ended march  standby letters of credit and financial guarantees written are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
these guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements  including commercial paper  bond financing  and similar transactions 
at march   these commitments totaled million 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
the company holds cash  marketable securities  or real estate as collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary 
the company has not been required to perform on any financial guarantees during the past three years 
the company has not incurred any losses on its commitments in fiscal  or the liability recorded associated with standby letters of credit at march  and was  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources the primary function of asset liability management is to ensure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive earning assets and liabilities 
management actively analyzes and manages the company s liquidity position 
the objective of liquidity management is to ensure the availability of sufficient cash flows to support loan growth and deposit withdrawals  to satisfy financial commitments  and to take advantage of investment opportunities 
liquidity is defined as being able to raise funds in days without a loss of principal 
the company s primary recurring sources of funds are customer deposits  proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans  proceeds from sales of loans  maturing securities  fhlb advances  and borrowings from the portland branch office of the federal reserve bank of san francisco 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
see the company s consolidated statement of cash flows to assist in analyzing our liquidity position 
the primary investing activity of the company is the origination of loans 
during the year ended march   the company originated loans  excluding loans purchased and loan participations  based upon new production in the amount of million 
the company maintains a laddered maturity of securities that provides prepayments and payments at maturity and a portfolio of available for sale securities that could be converted to cash quickly 
proceeds from maturity of securities provided million and million for the years ended march  and  respectively 
proceeds from the sale of loans provided million for the year ended march  and million for the year ended march  for the year ended march   proceeds from maturities and sale of securities were million and purchases of securities were million 
the proceeds from maturities and sale of securities were used to purchase securities 
in december  the company engaged in a million leveraged transaction  purchasing mortgage backed securities funded by cash and short term fhlb advances 
this generated net interest income  helping defray the costs of depository branches in hayden  idaho and boise  idaho 
mortgage backed and investment securities of million were purchased to minimize extension risk by shortening the maturity dates of securities given the current interest rate environment 
the primary financing activities of the company are customer deposits  brokered deposits  and fhlb advances 
as indicated on the company s consolidated statement of cash flows  deposits provided million for the year ended march   which consisted of a million increase in branch deposits and million increase in brokered deposits 
in addition  the company maintains a credit facility with the fhlb seattle  which provides for immediately available advances 
fhlb advances totaled million  including million merger premium  at march  the company also maintains additional credit facilities with us bank with available funds totaling million and the federal reserve bank of san francisco

in addition  at that date million of the company s investment securities were classified as available for sale 
the company has commitments that have a future impact on the company s liquidity position

impact of new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r  share based payment 
this statement replaces fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
statement no 
r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions for example  stock options granted to employees of the company be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments used 
statement r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
public entities other than those filing as small business issuers will be required to apply statement no 
r as of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after december  the company intends to adopt the provisions of fasb statement no 
r effective january   and is in the process of evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary asset  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transaction 
the amendments made by statement are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
statement is the result of a broader effort by the fasb to improve the comparability of cross border financial reporting by working with the international accounting standards board toward development of a single set of high quality accounting standards 
the statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the company intends to adopt the provisions of fasb statement no 
effective june   and does not expect the initial implementation to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
statement no 
 as originally issued  is effective until the provisions of statement no 
r are fully adopted 
all new disclosure requirements for the domestic plans of publicly traded entities are effective for years ending after december  estimated future benefit payments  and all other new disclosure requirements for foreign plans and nonpublic entities are effective for years ending after june  the company adopted the provisions of fasb statement no 
r effective march   and it did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations 
effect of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates 
as interest rates change  the interest income and expense streams associated with the company s financial instruments also change thereby impacting net interest income nii  the primary component of the company s earnings 
alco utilizes the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of nii to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated nii sensitivity over a rolling two year and five year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet as well as for off balance sheet derivative financial instruments  if any 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for nii exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth  given both a basis point bp upward and or bp downward shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period is assumed 
based on the asset sensitivity of the balance sheet at march   the bank is expecting to be well positioned to benefit from rising rates and minimize negative impact of declining rates 
if rates were to sustain a bp increase  net interest income would be expected to rise by  all else being equal 
if rates were to sustain a bp decrease  net interest income would be expected to decline by  all else being equal 
the following reflects the company s nii sensitivity analysis as of march  and as compared to the board approved policy limit 
march  bp flat bp dollars in thousands year nii    nii change nii change march  bp flat bp dollars in thousands year nii    nii change nii change the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon an indicator of expected future operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates
