item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in the following discussions  most percentage and dollar amounts have been rounded to aid presentation  as a result  all such figures are approximations 
references to approximations have generally been omitted 
restatement of certain results as of december  we restated our financial results for the year ended december  to correct an error related to the recording of certain accounts payable 
the correction increased our accounts payable and cost of sales for by million 
we also made correcting adjustments to depreciation expense in order for such amounts in to be consistent with our property and equipment accounting policies  which resulted in a reduction of depreciation expense in of million 
these corrections in the aggregate reduce previously reported net income for by million  or per diluted share 
all amounts presented and discussed below reflect the restatement 
general trends affecting our operations in the last several years  mrop requirements of large and middle market companies have moved towards a need for services that are customized for each company 
in many cases  our customers needs are centered upon reducing overall mrop costs and increasing operating efficiencies 
as a result  we have targeted sales through our fps program as the principal growth area of our business  and our resulting services for many customers extend well beyond the traditional business of supplying mrop products on a timely basis at a favorable price 
in connection with distributing a full line of mrop products to meet the needs of manufacturers and other industrial users  we offer our customers a wide range of specialized business process outsourcing services through our fps programs that relate to product selection and application and the customer s production processes that affect the utilization and costs of mrop supplies 
these service offerings include storeroom management commonly referred to as integrated supply  commodity management  bar code inventory replenishment  vending machines  e business solutions and consulting services  among others 
we were among the first mrop suppliers to offer these types of storeroom management arrangements to customers who desired to outsource all or a substantial portion of their mrop procurement and management functions 
drawing upon our experiences with storeroom management and specialized procurement and fulfillment services and our product knowledge  we have expanded our fps program to meet the growing demand for a wide variety of mrop service offerings 
as a result of the increased demand for fps  we have positioned our sales and marketing efforts to focus on fps as our major business strategy 
we believe the success of our fps focused strategy depends in major part on continued training of our sales and marketing personnel as well as our successful design and implementation of mrop procurement solutions that customers desire 
as discussed elsewhere in this report  fps is both a program comprising services that we offer to our customers as well as our approach to providing those services and mrop products 
in the fps program  we design and implement solutions individually tailored to accommodate each customer s particular mrop needs 
while fps sales and marketing is our major strategic focus  we continue to focus substantial attention on general sales of mrop products from stock or on a special order non stock basis especially to the mid market customer segment 
general mrop sales have historically been our principal source of revenue  and we expect that they will remain a source of substantial revenue  even as we increase our fps sales 
a summary review of our sales results for the past three years reflects the trend we see with respect to the demand for fps services among our mrop customers  which we believe supports our recognition of a similar trend within the industry in general 
our total sales for   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
of these amounts  fps sales including sales pursuant to storeroom management arrangements have increased steadily  both in dollar value even as total sales have declined and as a percentage of total sales  as reflected in the following table 
we expect the upward trend in fps sales to continue for the foreseeable future 

table of contents year ended december  net sales of total net sales of total net sales of total dollars in millions fps sales  including storeroom management general mrop sales total net sales certain effects of our increasing fps sales we expect that our fps sales will continue to increase  especially as a percentage of aggregate sales relative to general mrop sales 
we expect this will occur in large part from the addition of new fps customers 
we also expect the purchasing patterns of our fps customers to evolve and change as economic conditions change 
as a result of these expected changes in our fps sales  we may experience changes relative to prior years in measures such as i our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales and ii our selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 
these measures may change because of the nature of the revenue and cost components associated with fps sales and general mrop sales 
specifically  in fps arrangements in which we become the exclusive or primary supplier of a large volume of mrop products to a customer as occurs with a storeroom management contract  we may include management fee revenues designed to cover our administrative and overhead costs and performance based revenues where we share a portion of the cost savings we obtain for our customer  commonly referred to as gain sharing 
in addition  we often offer volume discounts on products to the customer as part of the overall arrangement to achieve mutually beneficial results for the customer and us 
in fps arrangements where we derive a portion of our revenues from management fees  the mix of product sales versus management fee and gain sharing revenues can cause our gross margin as a percentage of net sales to be higher even if our product sales are lower 
conversely  product discounts will yield a slightly lower gross margin from fps sales as product volume increases relative to service and gain sharing revenues 
the additional revenue sources from fps arrangements will tend to increase gross margins if product volume under these arrangements remains the same relative to general mrop sales 
as a result  our gross margins will most likely decline as this business grows 
currently  our fps arrangements typically yield a lower gross margin as a percentage of sales due to increased product volume than general mrop sales  however  these arrangements yield a higher operating margin than general mrop sales because our selling  general and administrative expenses are lower and more variable in fps arrangements 
at our storeroom management sites  many of our procurement support functions are performed at the customer s facility 
we therefore incur relatively low fixed costs as a percentage of total costs at storeroom management sites in comparison to our general mrop business  which has a higher fixed cost structure 
in addition  the costs of our associates are billed to our customers at most of our storeroom management sites 
because our selling  general and administrative expenses at storeroom management arrangements are variable  we can control them relative to the volume and activity of the site 
this control over expenses leads to higher operating margins in storeroom management arrangements 
to a lesser extent than with storeroom management arrangements  we may experience similar effects in connection with other fps services arrangements 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth a summary of our operating data and shows this data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated year ended december  as restated dollars in thousands net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative expenses operating income interest expense interest income other income loss  net earnings before taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change provision for income taxes earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change net earnings loss compared to net sales increased million  or  from million in to million in on a daily sales basis  revenues increased million  or  over the prior year 
total fps sales grew million  or  to million in as compared to as a percentage of total sales  fps sales increased to as compared to in the prior year 
the increase in fps revenues was due to the net increase of fps sites since december  at december   we had total fps sites  including full storeroom management arrangements 
in addition  increased production levels and our efforts to increase market share resulted in improved sales at existing sites 
we also experienced an increase in production levels at many of our general mrop customers  resulting in an increase in general mrop sales of million  or  from million in to million in most of the latter such increase occurred primarily as a result of increased volume at existing accounts 
cost of sales increased by million  or  from million in to million in as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales increased from in to in the greater percentage increase of cost of sales relative to net sales from to was primarily the result of lower gross margins on our general mrop sales  which reflects the results of intense competitive pricing in the market for business 
this amount was partially offset by an incremental million in year end rebates  and a decrease in inventory reserves as compared to the prior year 
in addition  approximately of the overall decrease in gross margins was due to the shift in sales mix from general mrop sales towards fps sales as discussed above 
this is because  as a general matter  our fps arrangements typically yield a lower gross margin than do our general mrop sales  due to lower prices in exchange for the exclusive relationship in these arrangements 
on the other hand  our fps arrangements typically yield a higher operating margin than general mrop sales because our fps sales generally have lower fixed costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in was primarily the result of an increase of million in variable selling expenses associated with the higher sales volume  including i salaries  commissions  and additional incentives of million due to improved operating performance  ii 
table of contents increased freight and delivery expense of million  and iii increased travel expenses of million 
these additional expenses were partially offset by a decrease in occupancy expense of million due to our facility rationalization program 
we now have facilities as compared to a year ago 
operating income increased million  or  from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to the increase in sales volume  which was only partially offset by a decrease in gross margin and an increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses as noted above 
interest expense decreased by million  or  from million in to million in the savings in interest expense was attributable to a decrease in the average monthly interest rate on our credit facility since december   as a result of lower libor rates and favorable pricing due to improved operating results  and to a reduction in the average amount of long term debt outstanding during relative to  to million from million 
the provision for income taxes decreased by million from million in to million in  or from to  respectively 
the decrease reflects a million reduction of our valuation allowance for our deferred tax asset associated with future deductible goodwill amortization and state net operating loss carryforwards  both of which we believe it is more likely than not we will realize in the future  as explained in note to our financial statements f 
that adjustment to our deferred tax asset was a non recurring benefit 
our effective tax rate for decreased to as compared to due primarily to the reduction in the valuation allowance which reduced the tax rate by effect of reduction in our rate 
compared to net sales decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decline in sales was directly related to the prolonged downturn in the economy that affected most of our customer base  but especially our customers in the energy  aerospace and automotive industries 
many customers in manufacturing sectors reduced production levels further and experienced more extended plant shutdowns in as compared to the prior year 
in addition  many local competitors offered discounted prices that appeared more favorable to some customers than ours  resulting in our loss of market share 
as a result of these factors  our general mrop revenues decreased million  or  from million in to million in partially offsetting the decline in general mrop sales  our total fps sales increased by million  or  from million in to million in fps sales as a percentage of total sales increased to  as compared to in the prior year 
specifically  storeroom management sales accounted for million  or  of total sales in during  we added new storeroom management sites at six new customers  and increased our total to storeroom management sites for customers 
cost of sales decreased by million  or  from million in to million in as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales decreased slightly from in to in inventory reserve expense decreased by million primarily due to our success in return to vendor programs  which was the driver of the decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales 
although gross margins improved since the prior year  it is important to note that due to a shift in sales mix from general mrop sales towards fps sales  there was some downward pressure on gross margin which we expect will continue as fps sales grow 
this is because our fps arrangements typically yield a lower gross margin than do our general mrop sales  due to lower prices in exchange for the exclusive relationship in these arrangements 
on the other hand  our fps arrangements typically yield a higher operating margin than general mrop sales because our fps sales generally have lower fixed costs 
there was also negative impact from competitive pricing pressure  which made up million of the variance 
the overall impact of the shift in mix and pricing pressures was approximately  which was more than offset by reduced inventory expense as mentioned above 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million in to million in  but as a percentage of net sales  such expenses remained constant due to lower sales volume 
in  we decreased selling  general and administrative expenses despite the cessation of our company wide furloughs program  which generated million in temporary savings in excluding the effect of furloughs in  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  as compared to salaries and benefits  excluding the effect of furloughs  were stable in as compared to the prior year  as we 
table of contents were able to maintain the savings realized in resulting from headcount reductions made 
overall  the reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses in was the combined result of lower bad debt expense of million  lower information technology and telecommunications expense of million due to contract renegotiations  and a million reduction in delivery and freight expense 
additionally  in we realized savings of million in occupancy costs associated with our facility rationalization program and a savings in depreciation expense of million for the year 
operating income increased million  or  from million in to million in this result was primarily attributable to the reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses from to  which was partially offset by the reduction in our sales volume 
interest expense decreased by million  or  from million in to million in the significant savings in interest expense was attributable to a decrease in the average monthly interest rate on our credit facility since december   as a result of lower libor rates  favorable pricing associated with our debt agreement renewal in may  and a reduction in the average amount of long term debt outstanding during relative to  to million from million 
we also realized million of additional savings due to the pay off of our premium financing agreement 
the provision for income taxes increased by million from million in to million in  as a result of more profitable operations in our tax rate decreased from in to in on january  we adopted sfas no 
 which resulted in a non cash charge to write off goodwill net of accumulated amortization of million  which was recorded as a cumulative effect of accounting change 
liquidity and capital resources capital availability and requirements at january   our total working capital was million  which included million in cash and cash equivalents 
we had million outstanding under our million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks the credit facility and an aggregate of million of borrowing capacity under that facility 
based upon our asset base and outstanding borrowings under the credit facility  we had borrowing capacity of million 
our credit facility was amended in to extend its term to may  the credit facility may be used for operations and acquisitions  and provides million for swinglines and million for letters of credit 
amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at either the lead bank s corporate rate or libor  plus applicable margins  as we may select from time to time 
we incur a fee between and basis points on the average daily unused capacity during the term 
assets of all our subsidiaries secure the credit facility 
we are also subject to certain financial covenants regarding fixed charges coverage  capital expenditures  and tangible net worth  which could affect our borrowing base under the credit facility 
our average borrowing rate is currently 
the principal financial covenants under our credit facility require a fixed charge coverage ratio of and capital expenditures of no more than million in any twelve month period 
our fixed charge coverage ratio was at december   and our capital expenditures were million for the twelve month period ended december  our covenants require a minimum tangible net worth of million  at december   our tangible net worth was million 
we are presently in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility and anticipate that we will remain in compliance with the covenants 

table of contents the table below outlines our contractual cash obligations  excluding interest  as they come due 
payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations our principal ongoing capital requirements at the present time are for servicing our outstanding debt as reflected in the above table  carrying inventory and accounts receivable  and purchasing and upgrading information technology and equipment 
we believe that cash flow from operations and the use of available capacity under our credit facility will be adequate to meet our obligations set forth above and to fund both our current operations and anticipated internal expansion for at least the current year 
we may consider a strategic acquisition opportunity if presented  in such case  cash financing would probably be necessary  and we would need approval from our current lenders or access to other capital sources in order to do so 
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
analysis of cash flows on a historical basis  net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal years   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
in  cash provided by operations was primarily the result of the increase in business activity and profitability that increased net income 
our increase in sales volume in resulted in more cash used by accounts receivable  however  this was primarily offset by cash provided by accounts payable due to increased purchases to service the increased volume 
when compared to  overall cash flow from operations decreased slightly in  but cash flow from operations in was primarily due to increased net income from increased sales volume and expansion of our business in the comparatively stronger performance in on this measure  while our sales volume and level of business activity were lower in than in  is primarily the result of i our improved working capital management procedures instituted in that affected both accounts receivable and inventory and ii our facilities rationalization and product management programs 
also in  cash was used by accounts payable because we lowered purchases to adjust to current sales levels 
from to  cash flow from operating activities decreased due to the decline in business activity and corresponding working capital needs 
net cash used in provided by investing activities for fiscal years   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
during  we used cash primarily for the purchase of computers and related it equipment 
during  we received cash of million  net of closing costs  as a result of the sale of three facilities 
cash used for capital expenditures in was million as compared to million in during  we used cash in investing activities primarily for capital expenditures 
net cash used in financing activities for fiscal years   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
our primary use of cash in financing activities in was for repayment of borrowings under our credit facility 
during  our primary use of cash in financing activities was for repayment of borrowings under our credit facility and payments under our management liability insurance 
additionally  in we used million of cash to retire a mortgage associated with the sale of a facility 
as compared to  there was a reduction in in cash used to pay for the management liability insurance  which was retired in march during  we used cash in financing activities primarily for repayment of borrowings under our credit facility  and other long term debt repayments 

table of contents certain accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates involve a higher degree of complexity and warrant specific description 
allowance for doubtful accounts methodology we have established an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on our collection experience and an assessment of the collectibility of specific accounts 
we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
initially  we estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of accounts receivable based on historical collections experience 
this initial estimate is periodically adjusted when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  a bankruptcy filing or announced insolvency or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable 
we do not believe our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts is likely to be adversely affected by any individual customer  since our customers are geographically disbursed and we have no individually significant customers 
we recorded bad debt expense of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
during   and  we wrote off million  million  and million  respectively  against our reserves for accounts receivable 
the write offs recorded in reflect a revision in our policy  adopted october   that uncollectible accounts over two years old should be removed from our accounts receivable balance 
this change in policy had no effect on either our results from operations or cash flows 
our reserve for accounts receivable was approximately million and million at december  and  or and of gross receivables  respectively 
inventories slow moving and obsolescence in connection with certain contracts  we maintain certain special inventories for specific customers needs 
in certain contracts  the customers are required to purchase the special inventory at the time that the inventory reaches a certain age 
however  for other customer relationships and inventories  we are not protected from the risk of inventory loss 
in such cases  we rely on available return privileges with vendors  if any 
therefore  in determining the net realizable value of inventories  we identify slow moving or obsolete inventories that i are not protected by our customer agreements from risk of loss  and ii are not eligible for return under various vendor return programs 
based upon these factors  we estimate the net realizable value of inventories and record any necessary adjustments as a charge to cost of sales 
if our inventory return privileges were discontinued in the future  or if customers were unable to honor the provisions of certain contracts that protect us from inventory losses  our risk of loss associated with obsolete or slowing moving inventories would increase 
we recorded inventory recoveries or expense for million  million  and million  in  and  respectively 
we wrote off million  million  and million against our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories during   and  respectively 
our reserve for obsolete and slowing moving inventories was approximately million and million at december  and  or and of gross inventories  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically evaluate property and equipment for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance 

table of contents future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired 
evaluating the impairment also requires us to estimate future operating results and cash flows  which also require judgment by management 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
deferred income tax assets we have net deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization of these net deferred tax assets are the reversal of taxable temporary differences  our forecast of future taxable income which is based upon estimates and assumptions  and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
on the basis of the improved operating results and projections for future taxable income  we believe it is more likely than not that our future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our net deferred tax assets 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income 
we evaluate the realizability and appropriateness of our deferred tax assets and liabilities quarterly and assess the need for any valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
during we determined that the future tax benefits associated with deductible goodwill amortization for tax purposes became fully realizable 
due to the extended reversal period and the uncertainty of projecting future taxable income over this period  the deferred tax asset associated with the goodwill amortization had been fully reserved for with a valuation allowance 
we made this determination primarily based on our projections of the future taxable income over the reversal period 
this resulted in a million or per diluted share for the year reduction of the valuation allowance and an associated reduction of income tax expense for the year 
we also reduced the valuation allowance by an additional million or per diluted share for the year for state net operating losses which became fully realizable during the year 
in the future  if it becomes more likely than not that we will be able to utilize certain deferred tax benefits that are presently reserved with a valuation allowance  or that there may be certain deferred tax liabilities that arise  we may adjust the valuation allowance accordingly 
in addition  if we experience a decline in earnings in the future  we may have to increase the valuation allowance 
the remaining million balance in the valuation allowance is for certain state net operating loss carryforwards 
self insurance and related reserves we are self insured for certain losses relating to group health  worker s compensation  and casualty losses  subject to stop loss limits 
we utilize third party administrators to process and administer all related claims 
we accrue an estimate for incurred but not reported claims and related expenses based upon historical experience 
the accrual for incurred but not reported claims relating to group health  worker s compensation  and casualty losses totaled approximately million at december  and december  the accuracy of our accrual for incurred but not reported claims is entirely dependent on future events that are subject to change 
because we are self insured  an increase in the volume or severity of claims in the future may cause us to record additional expense that was not estimable at december  we are not aware of any increasing volume or severity of individual claims 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that our exposures to market risks are immaterial 
we hold no market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
at present  we do not employ any derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  or derivative commodity instruments to hedge any market risk  and we have no plans to do so in the future 
to the extent we have borrowings outstanding under our credit facility  we are exposed to interest rate risk because of the variable interest rate under the facility
