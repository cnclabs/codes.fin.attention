item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company operates in three industry segments 
the company s metals recycling business collects  processes and recycles steel and other metals through its facilities 
the company s steel manufacturing business operates a mini mill near portland  oregon  which melts recycled metal  produces finished steel products and maintains one mill depot in southern california and maintains one in central california 
the company s auto parts business purchases used and wrecked automobiles and allows retail customers the opportunity of extracting parts for purchase in its self service auto parts stores  with located in california  three in canada  two in each of missouri and nevada and one store in each of ohio  virginia  texas  utah  illinois and indiana as of august  additionally  the company is a non controlling partner in joint ventures that are suppliers of unprocessed metals and  prior to october   other joint ventures in the metals recycling business 
the former joint ventures in the metals recycling business sold recycled metals that had been processed at their facilities processing and also bought and sold third parties processed metals trading

form k this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations generally discusses only the company s historical business and  thus  does not include information related to any of the businesses acquired subsequent to august  critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions provide a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and these differences may be material 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the average cost method 
the production and accounting process utilized by the company to record recycled metals inventory quantities relies on significant estimates 
the company relies upon perpetual inventory records that utilize estimated recoveries and yields that are based upon historical trends and periodic tests for certain unprocessed metal commodities 
over time  these estimates are reasonably good indicators of what is ultimately produced  however  actual recoveries and yields can vary depending on product quality  moisture content and source of the unprocessed metal 
to assist in validating the reasonableness of the estimates  the company not only runs periodic tests  but also performs monthly physical inventories 
physical inventories may detect significant variations in volume  but because of variations in product density  holding period and production processes utilized to manufacture the product  physical inventories will not necessarily detect significant variances and will seldom detect smaller variations 
to mitigate this risk  the company adjusts it physical inventories when the volume of a commodity is low and a physical inventory can more accurately predict the remaining volume 
in addition  the company establishes inventory reserves to further mitigate the risk of significant adjustments when determined reasonable 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when it has a contract or purchase order from a customer with a fixed price  the title and risk of loss transfer to the buyer and collectibility is reasonably assured 
title for both metals and finished steel products transfers upon shipment based on either cost  insurance and freight cif 
or free on board cib terms 
for retail sales by the company s auto parts business  revenues are recognized when customers pay for salvaged vehicle parts or when wholesale products are shipped to the customer location 
environmental costs the company operates in industries that inherently possess environmental risks 
to manage these risks  the company employs both its own environmental staff and outside consultants 
these consultants  environmental staff and finance personnel meet regularly to stay updated on environmental risks 
the company estimates future costs for known environmental remediation requirements and accrues for them on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that the company has incurred a liability and the related costs can be reasonably estimated 
the regulatory and government management of these projects is extremely complex  which is one of the primary factors that make it difficult to assess the cost of potential and future remediation of potential sites 
when only a wide range of estimated amounts can be reasonably established  and no other amount within the range is better than another  the minimum amount of the range is recorded in the financial statements 
adjustments to the liabilities are made when additional information becomes available that affects the estimated costs to remediate 
in a number of cases  it is possible the company may receive schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k reimbursement through prior insurance or from other potentially responsible parties identified in a claim 
in these situations  recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as an asset when realization of the claim for recovery is deemed probable and reasonably estimable 
goodwill in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded 
the company has adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and is required to assess goodwill for impairment at a minimum annually  using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit 
the first step determines whether or not an impairment has occurred and the second step measures the amount of any impairment 
these tests utilize fair value amounts that are determined by estimated future cash flows developed by management 
long lived assets the company is required to assess potential impairments of long lived assets in accordance with sfas  accounting for impairment of long lived assets  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair value based upon the most recent information available 
estimated fair market value is generally measured by discounting estimated future cash flows developed by management 
the company s long lived assets primarily include property  plant and equipment used in operations 
taxes deferred income taxes reflect the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates 
tax credits are recognized as a reduction of income tax expense in the year the credit arises 
a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforwards  to the amount more likely than not to be realized 
periodically  the company reviews the deferred tax assets to assess whether the valuation allowances are necessary 
results of operations during fiscal  the company s operations improved significantly  resulting in another record year for revenue and net income 
both the company s metals recycling business and steel manufacturing business recognized marked improvements over last year 
as well  the company s joint ventures in the metals recycling business benefited from rising selling prices to improve their profitability 
in addition  the auto parts business contributed to earnings growth during the year  principally due to new store additions and from rising prices for crushed autobodies and other recycled metal 
the results of operations of the company depend in large part upon demand and prices for recycled metals in world markets and steel products in the western united states 
beginning in fiscal  and continuing into the first half of fiscal  strong worldwide demand combined with a tight supply of recycled metals created significant price volatility and drove the metals recycling business average selling prices to unprecedented highs 
average selling prices declined in the second half of fiscal  but began to firm and rise again in the late part of the company s fourth quarter 
market prices for recycled ferrous metals fluctuate periodically  but have been unusually volatile in the last two years 
the higher prices have a significant impact on the results of operations for the wholly owned operations and joint ventures in the metals recycling business and to a lesser extent on the auto parts business 
the auto parts business purchases used and salvaged vehicles  sells parts from those vehicles through its retail facilities and wholesale operations  and sells the crushed autobodies to metal recyclers 
the auto parts business acquired four new stores in january  which represents a increase in the number of stores from last year end 
these new stores have led to increases in both retail and wholesale revenues 
in addition  revenues for the wholesale product lines are principally affected by commodity metal prices and shipping schedules 
the auto parts business benefited from improved pricing for crushed autobodies and other metals as compared to last year 
the self service retail operations schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k are somewhat seasonal and affected by weather conditions and promotional events 
since the stores are open to the natural elements  during periods of prolonged wet  cold or extreme heat  the retail business tends to slow down due to the difficult customer working conditions 
as a result  the company s first and third fiscal quarters tend to generate the greatest retail sales and the second and fourth fiscal quarters are the slowest in terms of retail sales 
during the first half of fiscal  west coast steel manufacturers including the company built inventory levels in anticipation of the spring construction period 
also during the first half of fiscal  many fabricators and steel distributors used the traditionally slow sales period to reduce their inventory levels and purchases of steel products  which reduced sales volumes below normal levels 
the second half of experienced higher sales volume as a result of customers replenishing their reduced inventory levels to prepare for the west coast construction season  as well as increasing consumption of steel in the western us average net selling prices for the company s steel products have remained relatively high  increasing by over the prior year 
fluctuations in the scrap metals market pricing have caused buyers of steel to anticipate future price decreases and some have adjusted their buying patterns 
in addition  there has been a rise in the amount of imported finished steel products  principally chinese wire rod  being delivered on the west coast which have a lower selling price than the company s comparable products 
on september   the company completed the separation and termination of its metals recycling joint ventures with hugo neu corporation 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the agreement 
on september   the company acquired greenleaf auto recyclers  llc greenleaf  five store properties leased by greenleaf and certain greenleaf debt obligations 
greenleaf is engaged in the business of auto dismantling and recycling and sells its products primarily to collision and mechanical repair shops 
greenleaf currently operates in locations throughout the united states 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details of this transaction 
on october   the company purchased substantially all the assets of regional recycling llc 
regional operates ten metals recycling facilities located in georgia and alabama 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details of this transaction 
the following tables set forth information regarding the breakdown of revenues between the company s metals recycling business  steel manufacturing business and auto parts business  and the breakdown of operating income for the respective segments  as well as joint venture income  corporate expense and intercompany eliminations 
the information does not include any amounts or adjustments related to the joint venture separation or the acquisitions of greenleaf or regional 
additional financial information relating to business segments is contained in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

corporate expense consists primarily of unallocated corporate expense for services that benefit all three business segments 
because of this unallocated expense  the operating income of each segment does not reflect the operating income the segment would have as a stand alone business 
ferrous recycled metal sales from the metals recycling business to the steel manufacturing business  and autobody sales from the auto parts business to the metals recycling business  are made at negotiated rates per ton that are intended to approximate market 
consequently  these intercompany sales produce intercompany profits  which are eliminated until the finished products are sold to third parties 
the environmental matters and impairment charges related to the metals recycling business in fiscal and and to the auto parts business in fiscal the amounts are shown separately to assist in understanding the business financial results 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
consolidated revenues for the year ended august  increased million or to million from million for the prior year 
the higher revenues resulted from higher average net selling prices for both the metals recycling business and the steel manufacturing business as well as higher wholesale and retail revenues for the auto parts business 
revenues for fiscal increased for the metals recycling business primarily as a result of increased prices in the worldwide ferrous metals market 
higher raw material costs and increasing steel consumption drove increases in selling prices for finished steel products sold by the steel manufacturing business 
auto parts business revenues benefited from increased prices for sales of autobodies and other recycled metal 
in addition  the auto parts business acquired four retail locations in the second quarter of fiscal that added both revenue and operating income to the segment over the prior year 
the metals recycling business generated revenues of million for fiscal  before intercompany eliminations  which was an increase of million or over the prior year 
ferrous revenues increased million  or to million as a result of higher average selling prices net of shipping cost average net selling prices  higher shipping costs and a slight increase in the volume sold 
the average net sales price for ferrous metals increased to per ton  which represents million of the revenue increase over the prior year 
the cost of freight that was included in revenues increased by million over the prior year due primarily to higher ocean chartering costs 
export shipping costs were volatile in fiscal and increased on average over the prior year 
total ferrous sales volumes increased slightly by approximately  tons or  which represents million of the revenue increase over the prior year 
the company s portland  oregon dock is under renovation see environmental matters and impairment charges below and is expected to be out of service until the spring of the closure of this dock since march has prevented the company from moving bulk export shipments from this facility 
however  the company has made operational adjustments to partially offset the impact of the closure 
schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k sales to the steel manufacturing business increased by  tons or to  tons due to increased steel production as a result of the new furnace installed in december partially offset by reduced sales during the furnace replacement shut down 
nonferrous revenue increased million or to million due to higher average selling prices and higher volumes 
the average net nonferrous selling price in fiscal was per pound  an increase of per pound or 
in addition  sales volume increased to million pounds 
the increases in average selling price and volume are related to strong worldwide demand  especially from asia  and improved by product recoveries of nonferrous metals from the ferrous metals shredding process 
in fiscal  the metals recycling business also recognized other revenues of million  an increase of million over other revenues for fiscal the majority of the increase relates to the recording of certain sales by the company s asian subsidiary 
typically  this subsidiary serves as a broker and  as a result  any revenues recorded are normally limited to brokerage commissions 
in fiscal  the subsidiary made sales of pig iron as a dealer 
thus  the sales proceeds are included in revenues while the related cost is included in the company s cost of goods sold for fiscal the auto parts business generated revenue of million  before intercompany eliminations  for the year ended august   which is an increase of million or over the prior year 
this increase was a result of higher wholesale revenues driven by higher average sales prices for scrapped autobodies due to rising ferrous recycled metal prices and higher prices and volumes for wholesale parts 
in addition  retail revenues increased as a result of the acquisition of four retail store locations in january the steel manufacturing business generated revenues of million for the year ended august   which was an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
the average net selling price increased per ton  or to per ton  which represents a million increase in revenue 
the increase in average net selling prices was due to a combination of factors including increased worldwide steel consumption and higher raw material costs that manufacturers passed through in the form of higher prices 
however  sales volumes decreased to  tons  which reduced revenues by million 
the lower sales volume was primarily due to abnormally high inventory levels held by fabricators and distributors of steel during the first half of fiscal many of the company s customers used the normal seasonal decline in consumption during the winter months to reduce their inventory levels 
cost of goods sold 
consolidated cost of goods sold increased million or for the year ended august   compared with last fiscal year 
cost of goods sold decreased as a percentage of revenues from to 
gross profit increased million to million during the latest fiscal year compared to fiscal  driven by profit improvements at the company s metals recycling  auto parts and steel manufacturing business segments 
cost of goods sold for the metals recycling business increased million or to million 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of goods sold decreased compared with fiscal from to 
gross profit increased by million to million 
the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to higher average net selling prices per ton  the decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue and positive inventory adjustments 
cost of goods sold was reduced by million in net inventory adjustments compared to million in inventory adjustments in fiscal during fiscal  several piles of ferrous metal inventory were fully utilized revealing higher inventory volumes than the company had previously estimated  resulting in a net decrease in cost of goods sold 
compared with last year  the average ferrous metals cost of sales per ton increased due primarily to higher purchase costs for unprocessed ferrous metals 
generally  a change in the cost of unprocessed metal has a strong correlation to changes in the average selling price 
thus  as selling prices rose compared with the last year  so did the cost of unprocessed ferrous metal 
the auto parts business cost of goods sold increased million or for the year ended august  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the higher cost of sales was primarily due to higher car purchase costs that resulted from higher scrap metal prices and the addition of seven new stores since the beginning of fiscal new stores that are not located in california tend to have higher cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of goods sold increased from to as compared to the prior year due to higher car purchase costs and the addition of the seven new stores since the beginning of last year which earn a lower margin than the previously schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k owned stores 
gross profit increased million or related to increased wholesale revenue earned from the higher market rates for scrap metals and the addition of seven new stores since the beginning of last year 
the steel manufacturing business cost of goods sold increased million or to million 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of goods sold decreased compared with fiscal from to 
the average cost of goods sold per ton increased per ton or compared to the prior year  which was primarily caused by higher raw material costs for recycled metal and alloys and an estimated million in costs resulting from the melt shop shut down in december to install the new furnace 
the increase in cost of sales was more than offset by the per ton increase in average net selling price  and gross profit improved by million  to million for fiscal operating income from joint ventures 
the company s joint ventures revenues and results of operations were as follows in thousands year ended august  total revenues from external customers recognized by joint ventures in the metals recycling business processing trading joint venture suppliers of metals operating income from joint ventures recognized by the company joint ventures in the metals recycling business joint venture suppliers of metals revenues for the joint ventures in the metals recycling business segment in fiscal increased million or compared with the same period last year primarily due to and increases in average net selling prices per ton for the processing and trading businesses  respectively  and an increase in the total volume of ferrous recycled metal sold  over the prior year 
the increase in the average net selling price per ton was due to the same supply and demand circumstances described earlier for the company s wholly owned businesses 
the company s share of joint venture operating income for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal in fiscal  the processing joint ventures recorded year end lifo adjustments which increased operating income by million  while such adjustments reduced operating income by million in fiscal additionally  these joint ventures experienced higher purchase prices for unprocessed metals  the effect of which was partially offset by increases in selling prices and volumes 
the company s share of joint venture operating income in fiscal included a charge of million for its share of environmental costs 
during the second quarter of fiscal  in connection with the negotiation of the separation and termination of the company s metals recycling joint ventures with hugo neu corporation  the company conducted an environmental due diligence investigation of certain joint venture businesses it agreed to acquire and identified certain environmental risks for which estimated remediation costs were accrued 
the company s share of operating income from the trading joint venture decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  a decrease 
on september   the company completed the separation and termination of its metals recycling joint ventures with hugo neu corporation 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the agreement 
accordingly  fiscal will only include one month of operating income for joint ventures in the metals recycling business 
schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k selling  general and administrative expense 
compared with fiscal  selling  general and administrative expense for this fiscal year increased million or 
the increase is a result of increased salaries of million  increased legal and professional fees of million  the vesting of stock options for million  and increased selling and administrative costs of million for the auto parts business segment  primarily related to new stores  offset by a million decrease in expense for the company s bonus program 
approximately million of the increased salaries are related to the auto parts business  primarily due to expansion of its management infrastructure to allow growth of this business segment 
the increase in legal and professional fees is the result of approximately million incurred related to the investigations into the past practice of making improper payments to customers in asia  as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  with an additional million spent on compliance with sarbanes oxley  including increased independent audit fees  and the use of outside experts to advise or assist the company in various projects 
the company s bonus program considers operating income  the utilization of operating assets and improvements over the prior year to determine bonus expense 
the company s anticipated bonus expense is less than the prior year because some of the company s business segments results did not exceed targeted improvements in fiscal to the same extent as in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expense has decreased by percentage points  from to due to spreading these expenses over higher revenues 
environmental matters and impairment charges 
during fiscal  the company recorded environmental charges of million for additional estimated costs related to the ongoing remediation of the head of the hylebos waterway adjacent to the company s tacoma  washington metals processing facility 
an estimate of this liability was initially recognized as part of the acquisition of the tacoma facility 
the cost estimate was based on the assumption that dredge removal of contaminated sediments would be accomplished within one dredge season during july february however  due to a variety of factors  including dredge contractor operational issues and other dredge related delays  the dredging was not completed during the first dredge season 
as a result  the company increased its environmental accrual by million primarily to account for additional estimated costs to complete this work during a second dredging season 
the company has filed a lawsuit against the dredge contractor to recover a significant portion of the increased costs 
however  generally accepted accounting principles do not allow the company to recognize the benefits of any such recovery until receipt is highly probable 
for a number of years prior to the company s acquisition of proler international corp 
proler  proler operated an industrial waste landfill in texas  which proler utilized to dispose of auto shredder residue from one of its operations 
in august  proler entered the texas commission on environmental quality tceq voluntary cleanup program vcp toward the pursuit of the vcp certificate of completion for the former landfill site 
in fiscal  tceq issued a conditional certificate of completion  requiring the company to perform on going groundwater monitoring and annual inspections  maintenance and reporting 
as a result of the resolution of this issue  the company reduced its reserve related to this site by million 
during fiscal  the company s portland  oregon metals recycling facility embarked on a dock and loading facility renovation 
the renovation was suspended in fiscal when issues with the dock s substructure were detected 
upon review of new engineering designs focused on operational efficiency and safety specifications  an impairment charge of million was recorded in fiscal to write off renovation costs incurred prior to the suspension 
interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal decreased to million compared with fiscal the decrease was a result of lower average debt balances during fiscal compared with fiscal income tax provision 
the tax rate for fiscal was higher than the for fiscal primarily because the fiscal tax rate benefited from the final release of a valuation allowance that had previously offset net operating losses and minimum tax credit carryforwards 
the rate approximates the federal statutory rate because projected extraterritorial income exclusion eti benefits on export sales are largely offset by state and other income taxes 
schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
consolidated revenues increased million to million for fiscal compared with fiscal revenues in fiscal increased for all company businesses primarily as a result of increased prices and demand in the worldwide ferrous metals market  including the addition of new export customers located outside of china 
significant improvements in demand coupled with lower steel imports led to increases in selling prices for finished steel products sold by the steel manufacturing business 
the auto parts business benefited from the increased ferrous metals prices in its sales of autobodies 
in addition  the auto parts business acquired three retail locations in canada that added revenue and operating income to the segment 
the metals recycling business generated revenues of million  before intercompany eliminations  which is an increase of million 
ferrous revenues increased million to million as a result of higher average selling prices net of shipping cost average net selling prices  higher shipping costs billed to customers and a slight increase in the volume sold 
the average net selling price of ferrous recycled metal increased per ton  or  to per ton which represents million of the revenue increase 
average export shipping costs increased over the prior year and represent million of the revenue increase 
in addition  ferrous sales volumes increased or  tons which represents million of the increase in ferrous revenue 
export volume is up over prior year 
moreover  over of the company s total ferrous sales were export shipments to asia in the last two fiscal years 
in fiscal  ferrous export sales to china decreased to of the total ferrous exports compared to more than in fiscal in addition  ferrous export sales to south korea increased to approximately of total ferrous export sales in fiscal compared to of ferrous export sales in fiscal new customers in thailand and india purchased of the company s export sales volume in fiscal sales volume to the company s steel manufacturing business increased to  tons due to increased demand in this finished steel business 
nonferrous revenues increased million to million due primarily to higher average prices 
the average net nonferrous selling price in fiscal was per pound  an increase of per pound from fiscal the auto parts business generated revenue of million  before intercompany eliminations  which is an increase of million or from prior year 
this increase is a result of higher wholesale revenues driven by higher average sales prices for scrapped autobodies due to rising ferrous recycled metal prices and the march acquisition of three retail store locations in canada 
the steel manufacturing business generated revenues of million  which is an increase of million or from prior year 
sales prices increased per ton or which represents million of the increase and sales volumes increased which represents million of the revenue increase 
the increase in selling prices are a combination of increased demand and passing along rapidly rising raw materials 
cost of goods sold 
consolidated cost of goods sold increased million or over the prior year 
cost of goods sold decreased as a percentage of revenue from in fiscal to in fiscal the reduction in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue is due to profit improvements at all of the company s business segments  led by the steel manufacturing business 
cost of goods sold for the metal recycling business increased million or to million 
the cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal gross profit increased by million to million for the year 
the increase in gross profit was attributable to higher average net selling prices per ton 
compared with fiscal  the average ferrous metals cost of sales per ton increased due primarily to higher purchase costs for unprocessed ferrous metals and higher export sales shipping costs 
generally  the change in the cost of unprocessed metal has a strong correlation to changes in the average selling price  however there is generally a delay in the timing between changes in net selling prices and the change in the cost of unprocessed metal 
thus  as selling prices rose compared with last year  so did the cost of unprocessed metal 
since purchase costs did not increase at the same rate as selling prices  we experienced significant increases in margins 
schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k the auto parts business cost of goods sold increased million or over the prior year 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of goods sold increased from to 
this increase was due to higher car purchase costs and increases in labor costs

cost of goods sold for the steel manufacturing business increased million or to million 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues in fiscal decreased to from in fiscal the decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue is attributable to higher average selling prices  higher sales volumes and the receipt of the final million electrode price fixing settlement  offset by a million pension charge 
average cost of goods sold per ton increased per ton or compared to the prior fiscal year 
as this increase in cost of sales per ton was more than offset by the per ton increase in average net selling price  gross profit improved by million in fiscal compared to fiscal impairment and other nonrecurring charges during fiscal  the company s portland  oregon metals recycling facility embarked on a dock and loading facility renovation 
the renovation was suspended in fiscal when issues with the dock s substructure were detected 
upon review of new engineering designs focused on operational efficiency and safety specifications  an impairment charge of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal to write off renovation costs incurred prior to the suspension 
in connection with the acquisition of the auto parts business  the company conducted an environmental due diligence investigation 
based upon new information obtained in this investigation  the joint venture accrued million in environmental liabilities in the second quarter of fiscal for remediation costs at the auto parts business s store locations 
no environmental proceedings are pending at any of these sites 
operating income from joint ventures 
the company s joint ventures revenues and results of operations were as follows in thousands year ended august  total revenues from external customers recognized by joint ventures in the metals recycling business processing trading joint venture suppliers of metals operating income from joint ventures recognized by the company joint ventures in the metals recycling business joint venture suppliers of metals the increase in revenues recognized by the joint ventures in the metals recycling business is attributable to higher average net ferrous selling prices and higher volumes 
shipments of ferrous metal processed by the joint ventures were million tons for the year ended august  compared with million tons in the prior year 
the volume of ferrous metal traded by the joint ventures increased to million tons in fiscal compared to million tons in the prior year  which came primarily from increased market share in mexico and latin america coupled with product line expansion into other scrap metal related commodities 
the average net selling price of ferrous recycled metal increased during that period to per ton from per ton  due to the same worldwide supply and demand factors affecting the wholly owned metals recycling business 
schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k in fiscal  the company s share of income from joint ventures in the metals recycling business increased to million due to higher average net selling prices  increased margins and more efficient operations  benefiting from similar market factors and pricing as described in the discussion above relating to the company s wholly owned metals recycling business 
the company s joint ventures with hugo neu corporation earned nearly all of this operating income 
the company s share of operating income from the global trading joint venture increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the company s share of joint venture operating income in fiscal also included an estimated million from a joint venture contract with new york city for the processing and disposal of curbside recycling materials that commenced in april operating income in fiscal was reduced by million representing the company s share of the joint venture lifo inventory adjustment compared with a reduction of million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million over fiscal the higher expenses were due to higher bonus expense  increased spending on sarbanes oxley compliance and professional fees and increased advertising expenses in the auto parts business 
the company s bonus plan is based upon the principles of economic value added eva and is directly tied to the financial performance of the company 
given the company s record financial performance in fiscal  bonus expense was significantly higher in fiscal than in fiscal interest expense 
in fiscal  interest expense increased million compared to fiscal due to higher average debt balances during fiscal income tax provision 
the tax rate for fiscal compares with a tax rate of for fiscal the increase in tax rate is primarily attributable to a reduction in estimated extraterritorial income exclusion eti tax benefits on export sales  an increase partially offset by the reversal of the million deferred tax valuation allowance associated with net operating loss and minimum tax credit carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources 
for fiscal  cash generated from operations was million  compared to million in fiscal the slight change in cash flow from operations was primarily related to an improvement in net income and changes in deferred taxes  offset by a decrease due to changes in the company s accrued liabilities balance related to income taxes and payroll  a slight increase in non cash joint venture income  an increase in prepaid expenses primarily related to the company s refundable and prepaid income tax balances at the end of fiscal  a reduction in accounts payable balances due to timing of payments  a decline in accrued expenses  and an increase in inventories due to rising procurement costs and volumes 
capital expenditures totaled million  million  and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the capital expenditures in fiscal included million in partial payments on the new mega shredder at the company s oakland  california export facility  million for the purchase of leased property housing the company s portland  oregon metals recycling facility see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  million for major repairs to the dock at that facility and million for installation of a new furnace at the steel manufacturing business 
the company anticipates that fiscal capital expenditures will be approximately million 
capital projects are expected to include installation of a mega shredder and completion of the dock repairs at the portland facility  installation of a mega shredder at and general modernization of the everett facility and installation of a mega shredder at the oakland facility 
additionally  the company will incur expenditures to convert certain greenleaf stores from full service to self service and modernize stores in the auto parts business 
the company had million of accrued environmental liabilities as of august  over the next months  the company expects to pay approximately million  primarily relating to previously accrued remediation projects in connection with one of its metals recycling facilities located in the state of washington on the hylebos waterway

the contract expires in september pursuant to a stock repurchase program approved in  the company is authorized to repurchase up to million shares of its stock when management believes such repurchases would enhance shareholder value 
management evaluates long and short range forecasts as well as anticipated sources and uses of cash before determining the course of action that would best enhance shareholder value 
as a result  during fiscal and  the company has made significant investments in capital equipment and has completed several acquisitions to grow the business and enhance shareholder value 
during fiscal year  the company made no share repurchases 
as of august   the company had repurchased a total of million shares under this program 
the company makes contributions to a defined benefit pension plan  several defined contribution plans and several multiemployer pension plans 
contributions vary depending on the plan and are based upon plan provisions  actuarial valuations and negotiated labor agreements 
the company anticipates making contributions of approximately million to the various pension plans in fiscal this amount excludes any contributions that may be made for the businesses acquired subsequent to august  additionally  the company anticipates further contributions to one of the multiemployer plans of the steel manufacturing business as discussed further under post retirement benefits in factors that could affect future results below 
historically  the company s available cash resources  internally generated funds  credit facilities and equity offerings have financed its acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital and other financing needs

form k the company believes its current cash resources  internally generated funds  existing credit facilities and access to the capital markets will provide adequate financing for acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital  joint ventures  stock repurchases  debt service requirements  post retirement obligations and future environmental obligations for the next twelve months 
in the longer term  the company may seek to finance business expansion with additional borrowing arrangements or additional equity financing 
factors that could affect future results 
this form k  including item of part l and item of part ii  contains forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities act of  that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of one can generally identify these forward looking statements because they contain expect  believe  anticipate  estimate and other words which convey a similar meaning 
one can also identify these statements as they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
examples of factors affecting the company that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following cyclicality and general market considerations purchase and selling prices for recycled metals are highly cyclical in nature and subject to worldwide economic conditions 
in addition  the cost and availability of recycled metals are subject to global supply and demand conditions which are volatile and beyond the company s control  resulting in periodic fluctuations in recycled metals prices and working capital requirements 
while the company attempts to maintain and grow margins by responding to changing recycled metals selling prices through adjustments to its metals purchase prices  the company s ability to do so is limited by competitive and other market factors 
additionally  changing prices could potentially impact the volume of recycled metal available to the company  the subsequent volume of processed metal sold by the company  inventory levels and the timing of collections and levels relating to the company s accounts receivable balances 
moreover  increases in recycled metals selling prices can adversely affect the operating results of the company s steel manufacturing business because increases in steel prices generally lag increases in ferrous recycled metals prices 
the steel industry is also highly cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions 
future economic downturns or a stagnant economy may adversely affect the performance of the company 
the company expects to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in its revenues and net income 
revenues can fluctuate significantly quarter to quarter due to factors such as the seasonal slowdown in the construction industry  which is an important buyer of the company s finished steel products 
weather and economic conditions in the united states and abroad can also cause fluctuations in revenue and net income 
another factor which may affect revenues relates to the seasonal reduction in demand from foreign customers who tend to reduce their finished steel production and corresponding scrap metal requirements during the summer months to offset higher energy costs 
the company makes a number of large ferrous recycled metals shipments to foreign steel producers each year 
customer requirements  shipping schedules and other factors limit the company s control over the timing of these shipments 
variations in the number of foreign shipments from quarter to quarter will result in fluctuations in quarterly revenues and earnings 
the company s expectations regarding ferrous metal sales prices and volumes  as well as earnings  are based in part on a number of assumptions which are difficult to predict for example  uncertainties relating to customer orders  metal availability  estimated freight rates  ship availability  cost and volume of unprocessed inventory and production output  etc the auto parts business experiences modest seasonal fluctuations in demand 
the retail stores are open to the elements 
during periods of extreme temperatures and precipitation  customers tend to delay their purchases and wait for milder conditions 
as a result  retail sales are generally higher during the spring and fall of each calendar year and lower in the winter and summer months 
as a percentage of revenue  the auto parts business wholesale sales  including sales of autobodies as well as cores  such as engines  transmissions  alternators and other nonferrous metals  have continued to grow in the past few years 
due to the nature of the wholesale business  which is more closely tied to the prices for recycled metals  the auto schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k parts business results are increasingly subject to the volatility in the global recycled metals market more than they had been historically 
additionally  the auto parts business is subject to a number of other risks that could prevent it from maintaining or exceeding its current levels of profitability  such as volatile supply and demand conditions affecting prices and volumes in the markets for its products  services and raw materials  environmental issues  local and worldwide economic conditions  increasing competition  changes in automotive technology  the ultimate success of the company s growth and acquisition plans  ability to build the infrastructure to support the company s growth plans  and integration issues of the full service business model 
backlog historically  the company has generally entered into export ferrous sales contracts by selling forward to days 
by knowing the price at which the processed material will be sold and the costs involved in processing the metals  the company has generally been able to take advantage of this differential in timing between purchases and sales and negotiate prices with suppliers that secure profitable transactions 
on august   the historical metals recycling business had a backlog of firm orders of million  as compared to million on august  for export ferrous metal shipments 
the timing of forward contracts may impact the company s revenues on a quarter to quarter basis as well as profitability on export shipments of ferrous metals 
competition the recycled metals industry is highly competitive  with the volume of purchases and sales subject to a number of competitive factors  principally price 
the company competes with both large and numerous smaller companies in its markets for the purchase of recyclable metals 
the company also competes with a number of domestic and foreign recycled metals processors and brokers for processed and unprocessed metal as well as for sales to domestic and foreign customers 
for example  in and  lower cost ferrous recycled metals supplies from certain foreign countries adversely affected market selling prices for ferrous recycled metals 
since then  many of these countries have imposed export restrictions which have significantly reduced their export volumes and lowered the worldwide supply of ferrous recycled metals 
these restrictions are believed to have had a positive effect on the company s selling prices 
given the intricacies in which the global markets operate  the company cannot predict when or if foreign countries will change their trading policies and what effect  if any  such changes might have on the company s operating results 
from time to time  both the united states and foreign governments impose regulations and restrictions on trade in the markets in which the company operates 
in fiscal  the company received a certificate from china that allows the company to continue shipping recycled metals into china 
the certificate is part of a process designed to ensure safe industrial and agricultural production in china 
it is not unusual for various constituencies to petition government entities to impose new restrictions or change current laws 
if imposed  these restrictions could affect the company s margins as well as its ability to ship goods to foreign customers 
alternatively  restrictions could also affect the global availability of ferrous recycled metals  thereby affecting the company s volumes and margins 
as a result  it is difficult to predict what  if any  impact pending or future trade restrictions will have on the operations of the company 
for the metals recycling business  some of the more significant domestic competitors include regional steel mills and their brokers who compete for recycled metal for the purpose of providing the mill with feedstock to produce finished steel 
during periods when market supplies of metal are in short supply  these buyers may  at times  react by raising buying prices to levels that are not reasonable in relation to more normal market conditions 
as a result  the company may have to raise its buying prices to maintain its production levels which may result in compressed margins 
the auto parts business competes with both full service and self service auto dismantlers as well as larger well financed more traditional retail auto parts chains for retail customers 
periodically  the auto parts business increases prices  which may affect customer flow and buying patterns 
additionally  in markets where the company has only a few stores  it does not have the same pricing power it experiences in markets where it has more than one store in which it operates 
as this segment expands  the company may experience new competition from others attempting to replicate the company s business model 
the ultimate impact of these dynamics cannot be predicted 
also  the business competes for its automobile inventory with other dismantlers  used car dealers  auto auctions and metal recyclers 
inventory costs can fluctuate significantly depending on market conditions and prices for recycled metal 
schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k the domestic steel industry also is highly competitive 
steel prices can be highly volatile and price is a significant competitive factor 
the company competes domestically with several steel producers in the western united states for sales of its products 
in recent years  the company has experienced significant foreign competition  which is sometimes subsidized by large government agencies 
there can be no assurance that such competition will not increase in the future 
in the spring of  the us government imposed anti dumping and countervailing duties against wire rod products from eight foreign countries 
these duties have assisted the company in increasing sales of wire rod products  any expiration or termination of the duties could have a corresponding adverse effect 
the company has experienced increased competition for certain products  principally chinese wire rod  by foreign importers during fiscal the company believes that the rise in import levels is attributable to the increase in selling prices in the west coast market  which potentially allow the import sales to be more profitable to the foreign companies 
the steel manufacturing industry has been consolidating over the last several years and  as a result  one west coast manufacturing facility has been closed and remains idle 
any future start up of operations of the currently idle facility could negatively impact the company s recycled metal and finished steel markets  prices  margins and  potentially  cash flow 
in general  given the unprecedented profitability levels of the company and other recycled metals and steel companies over the last two years  competitors may be attracted to the company s markets  which may adversely affect the company s ability to protect its profit margins 
geographical concentration the company competes in the scrap metal business through its metals recycling business 
over the last few years  a significant portion of the revenues and operating profits earned by this business has been generated from sales to asian countries  principally china and south korea 
in addition  the company s sales in these countries are also concentrated with relatively few customers that vary depending on buying cycles and general market conditions the company s sales have expanded to a broader geographic area with recent business acquisitions 
as always  a significant change in buying patterns  change in political events  change in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other export restrictions within the united states or these foreign countries  severe weather conditions or general changes in economic conditions could adversely affect the financial results of the company 
pending investigation as discussed in part i  item legal proceedings in this form k  the board of directors authorized the audit committee to engage independent counsel and conduct a thorough  independent investigation of the company s past practice of making improper payments to the purchasing managers of customers in asia in connection with export sales of recycled ferrous metals 
the board of directors also authorized and directed that the existence and the results of the investigation be voluntarily reported to the us department of justice doj and the securities and exchange commission sec  and that the company cooperate fully with those agencies 
the audit committee notified the doj and the sec of the independent investigation  engaged outside counsel to assist in the independent investigation and instructed outside counsel to fully cooperate with the doj and the sec and to provide those agencies with the information obtained as a result of the independent investigation 
on august   the company received from the sec a formal order of investigation related to the independent investigation 
the audit committee is continuing its independent investigation 
the company  including the audit committee  continues to cooperate fully with the doj and the sec 
the investigations of the audit committee  the doj and the sec of the company s past practice of making improper payments are not expected to affect the company s previously reported financial results  including those reported in this k 
however  it is probable that the sec and doj will impose penalties on the company as a result of their investigations 
because the company is unable to estimate either the timing or the amount or range of any penalties  the company has made no provision for penalties in its financial statements 
the company cannot predict the results of the aforementioned investigations or whether the company or any of its employees will be subject to any disgorgement or other remedial actions following completion of these investigations 
it is possible that these investigations could lead to criminal charges  civil enforcement proceedings and civil lawsuits 
union contracts the company has a number of union contracts  several of which were recently re negotiated  including the contract covering the company s steel manufacturing business 
if the company is unable to reach agreement on the terms of new contracts with any of its unions during future negotiations  the company could be subject to work slowdowns or work stoppages 
schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k post retirement benefits the company has a number of post retirement benefit plans that include defined benefit  supplemental executive retirement benefit plan serbp and multiemployer plans 
the company s contributions to the defined benefit and serbp plans are determined by actuarial calculations which are based on a number of estimates including the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  allocation of plan assets between equity or fixed income investments  expected rate of compensation increases as well as other factors 
changes in these actual rates from year to year cause increases or decreases in the company s annual contributions into the defined benefit plans and changes to the expenses recognized in the current fiscal year 
management and the actuary evaluate these rates annually and adjust if necessary 
the company s union employees participate in a number of multiemployer pension plans 
the company is not the sponsor or administrator of these multiemployer plans 
contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of the negotiated labor contracts 
the company learned during fiscal that one of the multiemployer plans of the steel manufacturing business would not meet erisa minimum funding standards for the plan year ending september  the trustees of that plan have applied to the internal revenue service for certain relief from this minimum funding standard 
the irs has tentatively responded  indicating a willingness to consider granting the relief provided the plan s contributing employers  including the company  agree to increased contributions 
the increased contributions are estimated to average per year  compounded annually  until the plan reaches the funded status required by the irs 
these increases would be based on the company s current contribution level to the plan of approximately million per year 
based on commitments from the majority of employers participating in the plan to make the increased contributions  the plan trustees have proceeded with the relief request  and are awaiting formal approval from the irs 
absent relief by the irs  the plan s contributing employers will be required to make additional contributions or pay excise tax that may equal or exceed the full amount of that deficiency 
the company estimated its share of the required additional contribution for the plan year to be approximately million and accrued for such amount in fiscal future funding deficiency assessments against the company are possible until the multiemployer plan obtains a waiver from the irs or the plan reaches the minimum funded status level required by the irs 
recently acquired businesses and future business acquisitions as discussed in part i  item business overview recent transactions  the company recently completed transactions to separate and terminate its metals recycling joint venture relationships with hugo neu corporation hnc and to purchase regional recycling llc and greenleaf auto recyclers  llc 
with the separation of the joint ventures  the company acquired direct ownership of metals recycling businesses in new england and hawaii and a metals trading business in russia and the baltic sea region 
the day to day operations of these businesses were overseen by hnc prior to the separation 
the company will depend on key employees of those businesses  particularly those involved in the metals trading operations  becoming employed by the company and providing for the continuity of those businesses 
as well  the company will be hiring additional key employees to help manage those businesses 
loss of or failure to hire key personnel or other transition issues could adversely affect the company 
additionally  given the significance of these recently acquired businesses relative to the size of the company  integration of these businesses will be challenging 
any failure to adequately integrate these businesses may result in adverse impacts on the company s profitability 
throughout the company s history  it has made a number of acquisitions as management attempts to improve the value of the company for its shareholders 
it is anticipated that the company will continue to pursue additional expansion of the metals recycling business and auto parts business 
each acquisition comes with its own inherent risks that make it difficult to predict the ultimate success of the transaction 
an acquisition may have a negative and or unexpected impact on the company s cash flow  operating income  net income  earnings per share and financial position 
schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k trading business risks schnitzer global exchange sge  the company s trading entity acquired in september  has various risks associated with its business operations 
sge operates in foreign countries with varying degrees of political risk 
it advances and occasionally loans money to suppliers for the delivery of materials at a later date 
credit is also periodically extended to foreign steel mills 
due to the nature of the business  profit margins are thinner than for the company s processing business  thus  unsold inventory may be more susceptible to losses 
also  the trading business has lower barriers to entry  making the company potentially more susceptible to competition than in its processing business 
replacement or installation of capital equipment the company installs new equipment and constructs facilities or overhauls existing equipment and facilities including export terminals from time to time 
some of these projects take several months to complete  require the use of outside contractors and experts  require special permits and easements and have high degrees of risk 
examples of such major capital projects include the installation of a mega shredder at a metal recycling yard  the overhaul of an export loading facility or the furnace replacement at the steel mill 
many times in the process of preparing the site for installation  the company is required to temporarily halt or limit production for a period of time 
if problems are encountered during the installation and construction process  the company may lose the ability to process materials which may impact the amount of revenue it is able to earn or may increase operating expenses 
additionally  it may also result in the building of inventory levels 
if market conditions then occur which result in lower selling prices  the company s profit margins may be adversely impacted 
in either case  the company s ability to reasonably predict financial results may be hampered 
reliance on key pieces of equipment the company relies on key pieces of equipment in the various manufacturing processes 
key items include the shredders and ship loading facilities at the metals recycling locations and the transformer  furnace  melt shop and rolling mills at the company s steel manufacturing business  including the electrical power and natural gas supply into all of the company s locations 
if one of these key pieces of equipment were to have a mechanical failure and the company were unable to correct the failure  revenues and operating income may be adversely impacted 
where practical  the company has taken steps to reduce these risks such as maintaining a supply of spare parts  performing a regular preventative maintenance program and maintaining a well trained maintenance team that is capable of making most of the company s repairs 
portland dock renovation the company s portland  oregon dock is under renovation and is expected to be out of service until the spring of the closure of this dock has temporarily impacted the company s ability to move bulk export shipments 
as a result  inventory levels are higher than normal at this location 
this factor could impact the company s profitability if the inventory is ultimately sold at lower prices than would normally be the case if the inventory had been sold within the typical to day period 
energy supply the company utilizes various energy sources to operate its facilities 
in particular  electricity and natural gas currently represent approximately of the cost of steel manufactured for the company s steel manufacturing business 
the steel manufacturing business purchases electric power under a long term contract from mcminnville water light mcminnville which in turn relies on the bonneville power administration bpa 
historically  these contracts have had favorable prices and are long term in nature 
the company s electric power contract expires in september on october   the bpa increased its electricity rates due to increased demand on the west coast and lower supplies 
this increase was in the form of a cost recovery adjustment clause crac added to bpa s contract with mcminnville 
the crac is an additional monthly surcharge on selected power charges to recover costs associated with buying higher priced power during the west coast power shortage 
because bpa can adjust the crac every six months  it is not possible to predict future rate changes 
the steel manufacturing business also has a contract for natural gas at mmbtu 
the current contract expires on may  and obligates the business to purchase minimum amounts of gas at a fixed rate 
effective november   the natural gas rate will be increased to per mmbtu 
this is a take or pay contract with a minimum average usage of  mmbtu per day 
gas not used is sold on the open market and gains or losses are recorded in cost of sales 
schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k if the company is unable to negotiate favorable terms of electricity  natural gas and other energy sources  this could adversely affect the performance of the company 
environmental matters the company records accruals for estimated environmental remediation claims 
a loss contingency is accrued when the company s assessment indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the company s estimates are based upon currently available facts and presently enacted laws and regulations 
these estimated liabilities are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs  new information or changes in laws and regulations 
tax laws the company s tax rate the last three years has benefited from state income tax credits  from the federal extraterritorial income exclusion eti on export sales and from the final releases of a valuation allowance previously offsetting the net operating losses and minimum tax credit carryforwards that had accompanied a business acquisition 
the company s future tax rates will benefit from the eti  although the american jobs creation act of the act will gradually eliminate the eti benefit 
compensating for the company s loss of eti benefit will be the new deduction under the act for qualified production activities income  but the effect of this new deduction on the company s effective tax rate will not be determinable until the newly issued final regulations explaining it are examined by the company 
the company will also likely continue to benefit from state tax credits 
currency fluctuations demand from the company s foreign customers is partially driven by foreign currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar 
strengthening of the us dollar could adversely affect the competitiveness of the company s products in the markets in which the company competes 
the company has no control over such fluctuations and  as such  these dynamics could affect the company s revenues and earnings 
the company conducts most transactions in us dollars 
shipping and handling both the metals recycling business and the steel manufacturing business often rely on third parties to handle and transport their products to end users in a timely manner 
the cost to transport the products can be affected by circumstances over which the company has no control such as fuel prices  political events  governmental regulations on transportation and changes in market rates due to carrier availability 
in estimating future operating results  the company makes certain assumptions regarding shipping costs 
the steel manufacturing business relies on the availability of rail cars to transport finished goods to customers and raw materials to the mill for use in the production process 
market demand for rail cars along the west coast has been very high which has reduced the number of rail cars available to the steel manufacturing business to transport finished goods 
in addition  the steel manufacturing business utilizes rail cars to provide an inexpensive form of transportation for delivering scrap metal to the mill for production 
although the company expects to be able to maintain an adequate supply of scrap metal  a larger portion of those materials are anticipated to be delivered using trucks 
the company anticipates this change in delivery may lead to increased raw material costs 
the company s providence  rhode island facility  acquired in conjunction with the separation and termination of its metals recycling joint ventures with hugo neu corporation  as discussed in part i  item business overview recent transactions  is leased from the port of providence 
a long term lease of this facility expired several years ago 
both parties have verbally agreed to terms for a long term lease of the facility and finalization of the lease is expected in the short term 
if the new lease is not finalized and the company fails to secure another similar facility  the company s ability to ship recycled metals cost effectively from this region would be significantly impacted 
schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k insurance the cost of the company s insurance is affected not only by its own loss experience but also by cycles in the insurance market 
the company cannot predict future events and circumstances which could cause rates to materially change such as war  terrorist activities or natural disasters 
it is not possible to predict or identify all factors that could cause actual results to differ from the company s forward looking statements 
consequently  the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties 
further  the company does not assume any obligation to update any forward looking statement
