item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the discussion and analysis is derived from the consolidated operating results and activities of first potomac realty trust 
the results of operations for the year ended december   represents the company s first full year of earnings and activities subsequent to its initial public offering completed in the fourth quarter of the results of operations for the years ended december  and  are based on the combined historical statements of operations of the first potomac predecessor 
the first potomac predecessor is not a legal entity but rather a combination of the following entities that comprised the historical operations of first potomac realty trust first potomac realty investment trust  inc  the general partner of its operating partnership since  first potomac realty investment limited partnership  its operating partnership  and first potomac management  inc  the property management company that managed all of its assets 
significant developments during  we completed the following acquired properties totaling  square feet at a contractual purchase price of million  sold a property for million  raised million through an underwritten public offering of  common shares at a price of per share  assumed mortgage loans in connection with properties that we acquired with a fair value at the acquisition date of million  entered into a new unsecured revolving credit facility with key bank and wells fargo to replace a secured facility with fleet national bank 
the facility initially has a maximum principal balance of million  a two year term with an additional one year extension available and a variable interest rate of libor plus to as determined by our leverage levels 
the facility can be expanded by up to an additional million  and filed an s registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to allow the company to issue from time to time up to million in debt and equity securities 
total assets at december  were million compared to million at december  critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated and combined financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap that require the company to make certain estimates and assumptions 
critical accounting policies and estimates are those that require subjective or complex judgments and are the policies and estimates that the company deems most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations 
it is possible that the use of different reasonable estimates or assumptions in making these judgments could result in materially different amounts being reported in our consolidated financial statements 
the company s critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  including evaluating the collectibility of accounts receivable  impairment of long lived assets and purchase accounting for acquisitions of real estate 
the following section is a summary of certain aspects of these critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition rental income with scheduled rent increases is recognized using the straight line method over the term of the leases 
accrued straight line rents included in the company s consolidated and combined balance sheets represents the aggregate excess of rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis over cash received under applicable lease provisions 
the company s leases generally contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse the company for a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred by it 
such reimbursements are recognized in the period that the expenses are incurred 
lease termination fees are recognized when the related leases are canceled and the company has no continuing obligation to provide services to such former tenants 
the company must make estimates related to the collectibility of its accounts receivable related to minimum rent  deferred rent  tenant reimbursements  lease termination fees and other income 
the company specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  tenant concentrations  tenant creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
these estimates have a direct impact on the company s net income because a higher bad debt allowance would result in lower net income 
investments in real estate and real estate entities investments in real estate are recorded at cost 
improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life  increase capacity  or improve the efficiency of the asset 
repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 
depreciation and amortization are recorded on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives as follows buildings years building improvements to years tenant improvements shorter of the useful lives of the assets or the terms of the related leases furniture  fixtures  and equipment to years the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to its rental properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income because if it were to shorten the expected useful lives of its rental properties  the company would depreciate such investments over fewer years  resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis 
when circumstances such as adverse market conditions indicate a possible impairment of the value of a property  the company reviews the recoverability of the property s carrying value 
the review of recoverability is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the real estate investment s use and eventual disposition 
these cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the values of its investments in real estate  including indirect investments in real estate through entities which the company may not control and which it accounts for using the equity method of accounting 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income 
the company estimates the fair value of rental properties utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis that includes projections of future revenues  expenses and capital improvement costs  similar to the income approach that is commonly used by appraisers 
purchase accounting the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the fair value of assets and liabilities in connection with purchase accounting adjustments recorded related to rental properties and additional interests in real estate entities acquired by it 
these assessments include allocating the purchase price of real estate acquired to the fair value of the building  land  tenant improvements  in place leases and other intangibles 
the company allocates the components of real estate acquisitions using computed relative fair values based on its estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the amount of costs allocated between land  building  tenant improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment and certain intangible assets 
these allocations also impact depreciation expense and gains or losses recorded on sales of real estate 
the company also values in place operating leases carrying rents above or below market as of the date of the acquisition  it then amortizes such values over the lives of the related leases 
the company s determination of these values requires it to estimate market rents for each of the leases and make certain other assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the rental revenue  depreciation expense and amortization expense it recognizes for these leases and associated intangibles

all of our outstanding debt contains customary  affirmative covenants including financial reporting  standard lease requirements and certain negative covenants  all of which the company was in compliance with as of december  the company is also subject to cash management agreements with most of its mortgage lenders 
these agreements require that revenue generated by the subject property be deposited into a clearing account and then swept into a cash collateral account for the benefit of the lender from which cash is distributed only after funding of improvement  leasing and maintenance reserves and payment of debt service  insurance  taxes  capital expenditures and leasing costs 
derivative financial instruments the company uses interest rate protection  or cap agreements to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on its variable rate debt

disclosure of contractual obligations the following table summarizes known material contractual obligations associated with investing and financing activities as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter mortgage loans payable interest expense operating leases the company has mortgage debt of  maturing in november and anticipates refinancing this debt or repaying it with borrowings on its revolving credit facility 
in addition to these obligations  the company had tenant improvement cost obligations of million that the company expects to incur in on leases in place at december  the company had no other material contractual obligations as of december  funds from operations many investors and analysts following the real estate industry use funds from operations ffo as a supplemental performance measure 
while the company believes net income available to common shareholders as defined by gaap is the most appropriate measure  management considers ffo an appropriate supplemental measure given its wide use by and relevance to investors and analysts 
ffo  reflecting the assumption that real estate asset values rise or fall with market conditions  principally adjusts for the effects of gaap depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  which assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time 
as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit in its march white paper as amended in november and april  ffo represents net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains losses on sales of real estate  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company computes ffo in accordance with nareit s definition  which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo  or similarly titled measures  used by other companies and this may not be comparable to those presentations 
ffo should not be viewed as a substitute to net income as a measure of the company s operating performance since it does not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of the company s properties  which are significant economic costs that could materially impact the company s results of operations 
the following table presents a reconciliation of net income to ffo for the year ended december  the company has not presented ffo for since it does not consider full year operating results indicative of results subsequent to its initial public offering and therefore not a meaningful supplemental performance measure

risk factors investing in our company involves various risks  including the risk that you might lose your entire investment 
the following discussion concerns some of the risks associated with our business 
these risks are interrelated  and you should treat them as a whole 
the risks described below are not the only risks that may affect us 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or not identified below  may also materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
risks related to our business and properties we have recently experienced rapid growth and may not be able to adapt our management and operational systems without unanticipated disruption or expense 
we are currently experiencing a period of rapid growth 
as a result of our rapid growth  we cannot assure you that we will be able to adapt our management  administrative  accounting and operational systems  or hire and retain sufficient operational staff to integrate properties into our portfolio or manage any future acquisitions of properties without operating disruptions or unanticipated costs 
our acquisitions of properties will generate additional operating expenses that we will be required to pay 
our growth has required  and our growth will continue to require  increased investment in management personnel  professional fees  other personnel  financial and management systems and controls and facilities  which could cause our operating margins to decline from historical levels  especially in the absence of revenue growth 
as we acquire additional properties  we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties  including tenant retention and mortgage default 
our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions into our portfolio and manage our growth could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we are subject to the credit risk of our tenants  which may fail to make lease payments and thereby cause a significant decrease in our revenues 
we are subject to the credit risk of our tenants 
we cannot assure you that our tenants will not default on their leases and fail to make rental payments to us 
in particular  local economic conditions and factors affecting the industries in which our tenants operate may affect our tenants ability to make lease payments to us 
moreover  we may be unable to locate a replacement tenant in a timely manner or on comparable or better terms if a tenant defaults on its lease 
the loss of rental revenues from a number of our tenants and our inability to replace such tenants may adversely affect our profitability and our ability to meet our financial obligations 
a majority of our tenants hold leases covering less than  square feet 
many of these tenants are small companies with nominal net worth 
the loss of rental revenues from a number of our tenants may adversely affect our profitability and our ability to meet our financial obligations 
loss of the us government as a tenant could lead to a substantial decrease in our cash flow and an impairment of the value of our properties 
the us government accounts for more than of our annualized base rent as of december  the loss of the federal government as a tenant or the loss of a future significant tenant would have an adverse effect on our financial results and the value of our affected properties 
a reduction or elimination of rent from the us government or other significant tenants would reduce our cash flow and adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
our debt level may have a negative impact on our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pursue our business plan 
we have incurred indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of our properties  and we will incur new indebtedness in the future in connection with our acquisition  development and operating activities 
our use of debt financing creates risks  including that our cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest  that we will be unable to refinance some or all of our indebtedness or that any refinancing will not be on terms as favorable as those of the existing indebtedness  that required debt payments are not reduced if the economic performance of any property declines  that debt service obligations will reduce funds available for distribution to our shareholders and funds available for acquisitions  and that any default on our indebtedness could result in acceleration of those obligations and possible loss of property to foreclosure 
if the economic performance of any of our properties declines  our ability to make debt service payments would be adversely affected 
if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments  we may lose that property to lender foreclosure with a resulting loss of income and asset value 
we do not have a policy limiting the amount of debt that we may incur  although we have established to as the target range for our total debt to market capitalization 
accordingly  our management and board of trustees have discretion to increase the amount of our outstanding debt at any time 
our leverage levels may make it difficult to obtain additional financing based on our current portfolio or to refinance existing debt on favorable terms or at all 
in addition  the terms of our revolving credit facility limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur 
failure to obtain additional financing could impede our ability to grow and develop our business 
our leverage levels also may adversely affect the market price of our common shares if an investment in our company is perceived to be more risky than an investment in our peers 
our variable rate debt subjects us to interest rate risk 
we have a substantial amount of mortgage debt with interest rates that vary depending upon the market index 
in addition  we have a revolving credit facility with key bank and wells fargo that bears interest at a variable rate on any amounts drawn on the facility 
we may incur additional variable rate debt in the future 
increases in interest rates on variable rate debt would increase our interest expense  which would adversely affect net earnings and cash available for payment of our debt obligations and distributions to our shareholders 
we compete with other parties for tenants and property acquisitions and many of these parties have substantially greater resources than we have 
our business strategy contemplates expansion through acquisition 
the commercial real estate industry is highly competitive  and we compete with substantially larger companies  including substantially larger reits  for the acquisition  development and leasing of properties 
some of these companies are national or regional operators with far greater resources than we have 
as a result  we may not be able or have the opportunity to make suitable investments on favorable terms in the future 
competition in a particular area also could adversely affect our ability to lease our properties or to increase or maintain rental rates 
newly developed and acquired properties may not produce the cash flow that we expect  which could adversely affect our overall financial performance 
over the last few years  we have focused our efforts on the acquisition and redevelopment of industrial and flex properties 
we intend to continue to acquire  and may in the future develop  industrial and flex properties 
in deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property  we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property 
in particular  we estimate the return on our investment based on expected occupancy and rental rates 
if our estimated return on investment proves to be inaccurate  and the property is unable to achieve the expected occupancy and rental rates  it may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment 
when we acquire a property  we often plan to reposition or redevelop that property with the goal of increasing profitability 
our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate  which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals 
additionally  we may acquire new properties not fully leased  and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with that property until the property is more fully leased 
if one or more of these new properties do not perform as expected or we are unable to successfully integrate new properties into our existing operations  our financial performance may be adversely affected 
all of our properties are located in the southern mid atlantic region  making us vulnerable to changes in economic conditions in that region 
economic conditions in the southern mid atlantic region may significantly affect the occupancy and rental rates of our properties 
a decline in occupancy and rental rates  in turn  may significantly affect our profitability and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations 
the economic condition of the region may depend on one or more industries and  therefore  an economic downturn in one of these industry sectors may adversely affect our performance 
local real estate market conditions may include a large supply of competing space  and we compete for tenants based on rental rates  attractiveness and location of a property  and quality of maintenance and management services 
as a result of the geographic concentration of our properties  our performance  our ability to make cash distributions  and the value of our properties will depend upon economic conditions in the region  including local real estate conditions and competition 
there can be no assurance that these markets will continue to grow or that economic conditions will remain favorable 
if unfavorable economic conditions occur in the region  our ability to make distributions to our shareholders could be adversely affected 
in particular  we are directly affected by decreases in federal government spending 
development and construction risks could adversely affect our profitability 
we may develop new properties in the future 
our renovation  redevelopment  development and related construction activities may subject us to the following risks we may be unable to obtain  or suffer delays in obtaining  necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations  which could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects 
we may incur construction costs for a property which exceed our original estimates due to increased costs for materials or labor or other costs that we did not anticipate 
we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms  which may render us unable to proceed with our development activities 
we may be unable to complete construction and lease up of a property on schedule  which could result in increased debt service expense or construction costs 
additionally  the time frame required for development  construction and lease up of these properties means that we may have to wait years for a significant cash return 
because we are required to make cash distributions to our shareholders  if the cash flow from operations or refinancing is not sufficient  we may be forced to borrow additional money to fund such distributions 
failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth 
we may make selected acquisitions outside our current geographic market from time to time as appropriate opportunities arise 
our historical experience is in the southern mid atlantic region  and we may not be able to operate successfully in other market areas 
we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets 
these risks include a lack of market knowledge and understanding of the local economies  an inability to identify promising acquisition or development opportunities  an inability to obtain construction trades people  and an unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures 
any of these factors could adversely affect the profitability of projects outside our current markets and limit the success of our acquisition and development strategy 
if our acquisition and development strategy is negatively affected  the profitability  growth  and development of our business may be impeded 
we may be unable to renew expiring leases or re lease vacant space on a timely basis or on attractive terms  which could significantly decrease our cash flow 
current tenants may not renew their leases upon the expiration of their terms 
alternatively  current tenants may attempt to terminate their leases prior to the expiration of their current terms 
if non renewals or terminations occur  we may not be able to locate qualified replacement tenants and  as a result  we would lose a significant source of revenue while remaining responsible for the payment of our obligations 
moreover  the terms of a renewal or new lease may be less favorable than the current lease terms 
any of these factors could cause a decline in lease revenue  which would have a negative impact on our profitability 
under some of our leases  tenants have the right to terminate prior to the scheduled expiration of the lease 
some of our leases for our current properties provide tenants with the right to terminate prior to the scheduled expiration of the lease 
if a tenant terminates its lease with us prior to the expiration of the term  we may be unable to re lease that space on as favorable terms  or at all  which could adversely affect our cash flow 
property owned through joint ventures  or in limited liability companies and partnerships in which we are not the sole equity holder  may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interests 
we may make investments through partnerships  limited liability companies or joint ventures in the future 
partnership  limited liability company or joint venture investments may involve various risks  including the following our partners or joint venturers might become bankrupt in which event we and any other remaining general partners or joint venturers would generally remain liable for the liabilities of the partnership or joint venture  our partners  co members or joint venturers might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals  our partners  co members or joint venturers may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions  requests  policies  or objectives  including our current policy with respect to maintaining our qualification as a real estate investment trust  and agreements governing joint ventures  limited liability companies and partnerships often contain restrictions on the transfer of a joint venturer s  member s or partner s interest or buy sell or other provisions that may result in a purchase or sale of the interest at a disadvantageous time or on disadvantageous terms 
our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in partnerships  limited liability companies or joint ventures 
the occurrence of one or more of the events described above could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and ability to make distributions with respect to  and the market price of  our common shares 
risks related to our organization and structure our executive officers have agreements that provide them with benefits in the event of a change in control of our company or if their employment agreement is not renewed 
we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers  louis t 
donatelli  douglas j 
donatelli  nicholas r 
smith  barry h 
bass  james h 
dawson and joel f 
bonder that provide them with severance benefits if their employment ends under certain circumstances following a change in control of our company or if the executive officer resigns for good reason as defined in the employment agreements 
these benefits could increase the cost to a potential acquirer of our company and thereby prevent or deter a change in control of the company that might involve a premium price for our common shares or otherwise be in the interests of our shareholders 
we may experience conflicts of interest with several members of our board of trustees and our executive officers relating to their ownership of units of our operating partnership 
our trustees and executive officers may have conflicting duties because  in their capacities as our trustees and executive officers  they have a duty to our company  and in our capacity as general partner of our operating partnership  they have a fiduciary duty to the limited partners  and some of them are themselves limited partners 
these conflicts of interest could lead to decisions that are not in your best interest 
conflicts may arise when the interests of our shareholders and the limited partners of our operating partnership diverge  particularly in circumstances in which there may be an adverse tax consequence to the limited partners  such as upon the sale of assets or the repayment of indebtedness 
we depend on key personnel with long standing business relationships  the loss of whom could threaten our ability to operate our business successfully 
our future success depends  to a significant extent  upon the continued services of our senior management team  including douglas j 
donatelli  nicholas r 
smith and louis t 
donatelli 
in particular  the extent and nature of the relationships that messrs 
donatelli and mr 
smith and the other members of our senior management team have developed in the real estate community in our markets is critically important to the success of our business 
although we have employment agreements with messrs 
donatelli and mr 
smith and other key executive officers  there is no guarantee that messrs 
donatelli and mr 
smith or these other key executive officers will remain employed with us 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers 
the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team  particularly messrs 
donatelli and mr 
smith  would harm our business and prospects 
further  loss of a member of our senior management team could be negatively perceived in the capital markets  which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares 
the chairman of our board of trustees  louis t 
donatelli  has other business interests that may hinder his ability to allocate sufficient time to the management of our operations  which could jeopardize our ability to execute our business plan and he and certain other of our trustees may have conflicts of interest with our company 
our chairman  louis t 
donatelli  has other business interests that may hinder his ability to spend adequate time on our business 
mr 
donatelli is also chairman of donatelli klein  inc d k  a real estate investment firm that focuses on the washington  dc area 
mr 
donatelli s employment agreement permits him to continue to provide management and other services to d k 
the provision of those services may reduce the time mr 
donatelli is able to devote to our business 
in addition  the terms of mr 
donatelli s employment agreement permit him to compete against us outside of a specific geographic area and outside of the industrial or flex property market during the term of his employment agreement 
one of our trustees  terry l 
stevens  currently serves as vice president  chief financial officer and treasurer of highwoods properties  inc  a fully integrated  north carolina based reit that owns  leases  manages  develops  and constructs office  industrial and retail properties  some of which are located in our target markets 
as a result  conflicts may arise when our company and highwoods properties  inc compete in the same markets for properties  tenants  personnel and other services 
our rights and the rights of our shareholders to take action against our trustees and officers are limited  which could limit your recourse in the event of actions not in your best interests 
maryland law provides that a trustee has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith  in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances 
our amended and restated declaration of trust authorizes us to indemnify our trustees and officers for actions taken by them in those capacities to the extent permitted by maryland law 
in addition  our declaration of trust limits the liability of our trustees and officers for money damages  except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money  property or services  or a final judgment based upon a finding of active and deliberate dishonesty by the trustee or officer that was material to the cause of action adjudicated 
as a result  we and our shareholders may have more limited rights against our trustees and officers than might otherwise exist 
our amended and restated bylaws require us to indemnify each trustee or officer who has been successful  on the merits or otherwise  in the defense of any proceeding to which he or she is made a party by reason of his or her service to us 
in addition  we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our trustees and officers 
our board of trustees may approve the issuance of preferred shares with terms that may discourage a third party from acquiring us 
our declaration of trust permits our board of trustees initially to issue up to  preferred shares  issuable in one or more classes or series 
our board of trustees may increase the number of preferred shares authorized by our declaration of trust without shareholder approval 
our board of trustees may also classify or reclassify any unissued preferred shares and establish the preferences and rights including the right to vote  participate in earnings and to convert into securities of any such preferred shares  which rights may be superior to those of our common shares 
thus  our board of trustees could authorize the issuance of preferred shares with terms and conditions that could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which holders of some or a majority of the common shares might receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price of our common shares 
our ownership limitations may restrict business combination opportunities 
to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code  no more than of the value of our outstanding shares of beneficial interest may be owned  directly or under applicable attribution rules  by five or fewer individuals as defined to include certain entities during the last half of each taxable year other than our first reit taxable year 
to preserve our reit qualification  our declaration of trust generally prohibits direct or indirect ownership by any person of i more than of the number or value of our outstanding common shares or ii more than of the value of our outstanding shares of all classes 
generally  shares owned by affiliated owners will be aggregated for purposes of the ownership limitation 
our declaration of trust has created a special higher ownership limitation of no more than for the group comprised of louis t 
donatelli  douglas j 
donatelli and certain related persons 
unless the applicable ownership limitation is waived by our board of trustees prior to transfer  any transfer of our common shares that would violate the ownership limitation will be null and void  and the intended transferee will acquire no rights in such shares 
common shares that would otherwise be held in violation of the ownership limit will be designated as shares in trust and transferred automatically to a trust effective on the day before the purported transfer or other event giving rise to such excess ownership 
the beneficiary of the trust will be one or more charitable organizations named by us 
the ownership limitation could have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control or other transaction in which holders of common shares might receive a premium for their common shares over the then current market price or that such holders might believe to be otherwise in their best interests 
the ownership limitation provisions also may make our common shares an unsuitable investment vehicle for any person seeking to obtain  either alone or with others as a group  ownership of i more than of the number or value of our outstanding common shares or ii more than in value of our outstanding shares of all classes 
our board of trustees may change our investment and operational policies and practices without a vote of our common shareholders  which limits your control of our policies and practices 
our major policies  including our policies and practices with respect to investments  financing  growth  debt capitalization  reit qualification and distributions  are determined by our board of trustees 
although we have no present intention to do so  our board of trustees may amend or revise these and other policies from time to time without a vote of our shareholders 
accordingly  our shareholders will have limited control over changes in our policies 
our declaration of trust and bylaws do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we or our operating partnership may incur 
if we become highly leveraged  then the resulting increase in debt service could adversely affect our ability to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness and harm our financial condition 
our declaration of trust contains provisions that make removal of our trustees difficult  which could make it difficult for our shareholders to effect changes to our management 
our declaration of trust provides that a trustee may only be removed upon the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of our outstanding common shares 
vacancies may be filled by the board of trustees 
this requirement makes it more difficult to change our management by removing and replacing trustees 
our bylaws may only be amended by our board of trustees  which could limit your control of certain aspects of our corporate governance 
our board of trustees has the sole authority to amend our bylaws 
thus  the board is able to amend the bylaws in a way that may be detrimental to your interests 
maryland law may discourage a third party from acquiring us 
maryland law provides broad discretion to our board of trustees with respect to its fiduciary duties in considering a change in control of our company  including that our board is subject to no greater level of scrutiny in considering a change in control transaction than with respect to any other act by our board 
the maryland business combination act restricts mergers and other business combinations between our company and an interested shareholder 
an interested shareholder is defined as any person who is the beneficial owner of or more of the voting power of our common shares and also includes any of our affiliates or associates that  at any time within the two year period prior to the date of a proposed merger or other business combination  was the beneficial owner of or more of our voting power 
additionally  the control shares provisions of the maryland general corporation law  or mgcl  are applicable to us as if we were a corporation 
these provisions eliminate the voting rights of shares acquired in quantities so as to constitute control shares  as defined under the mgcl 
our amended and restated declaration of trust and or bylaws provide that we are not bound by the business combination act or the control share acquisition statute 
however  in the case of the control share acquisition statute  our board of trustees may opt to make this statute applicable to us at any time  and may do so on a retroactive basis 
finally  the unsolicited takeovers provisions of the mgcl permit our board of trustees  without shareholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our declaration of trust or bylaws  to implement takeover defenses that we do not yet have 
these provisions may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making an acquisition proposal for our company or of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common shares with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price or would otherwise be in the interests of our shareholders 
risks related to the real estate industry real estate investments are inherently risky  which could adversely affect our profitability and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
real estate investments are subject to varying degrees of risk 
if we acquire or develop properties and they do not generate sufficient operating cash flow to meet operating expenses  including debt service  capital expenditures and tenant improvements  our income and ability to make distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected 
income from properties may be adversely affected by decreases in rent and or occupancy rates due to competition or other factors  increases in operating costs such as real estate taxes  insurance premiums  site maintenance and utilities  changes in interest rates and the availability of financing  and changes in laws and governmental regulations  including those governing real estate usage  zoning and taxes 
general economic conditions may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
periods of economic slowdown or recession in the united states and in other countries  rising interest rates or declining demand for real estate  or the public perception that any of these events may occur  could result in a general decline in rents or an increased incidence of defaults by our tenants under existing leases  which could adversely affect our financial position  results of operations  cash flow  trading price of our common shares and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make distributions to our shareholders 
illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties and harm our financial condition 
because real estate investments are relatively illiquid  our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in our portfolio in response to adverse changes in the performance of such properties may be limited  thus harming our financial condition 
the real estate market is affected by many factors that are beyond our control  including adverse changes in national and local economic and market conditions  changes in interest rates and in the availability  cost and terms of debt financing  changes in governmental laws and regulations  fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and costs of compliance with laws and regulations  fiscal policies and ordinances  the ongoing need for capital improvements  particularly in older buildings  changes in operating expenses  and civil unrest  acts of war and natural disasters  including earthquakes and floods  which may result in uninsured and underinsured losses 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us  or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us 
we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property 
we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold 
we cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements 
in acquiring a property  we may agree to lock out provisions that materially restrict us from selling that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions  such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property 
we may also acquire properties that are subject to a mortgage loan that may limit our ability to sell the properties prior to the loan s maturity 
these factors and any others that would impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition  as well as our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
the costs of compliance with or liabilities under environmental laws may harm our operating results 
our operating expenses could be higher than anticipated due to the cost of complying with existing or future environmental laws and regulations 
an owner of real property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property 
we may face liability regardless of our knowledge of the contamination  the timing of the contamination  the cause of the contamination  or the party responsible for the contamination of the property 
there may be environmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware 
some of our properties contain  or may have contained in the past  underground tanks for the storage of petroleum based or waste products that could create a potential for release of hazardous substances 
if environmental contamination exists on our properties  we could become subject to strict  joint and several liability for the contamination by virtue of our ownership interest 
the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to sell the property and we may incur substantial remediation costs  thus harming our financial condition 
in addition  although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all applicable laws and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from a tenant s activities on the property  we could nonetheless be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest for environmental liabilities created by our tenants  and we cannot be sure that our tenants would satisfy their indemnification obligations under the applicable sales agreement or lease 
the discovery of material environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
our properties may contain or develop harmful mold  which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediating the problem 
when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials  mold growth may occur  particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time 
some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants 
concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing as exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms  including allergic or other reactions 
as a result  the presence of significant mold at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected property 
in addition  the presence of significant mold could expose us to liability from our tenants  employees of our tenants and others if property damage or health concerns arise 
compliance with the americans with disabilities act and fire  safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that adversely impact our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
all of our properties are required to comply with the americans with disabilities act  or the ada 
the ada has separate compliance requirements for public accommodations and commercial facilities  but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities 
compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and non compliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants  or both 
while the tenants to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions  and typically under our leases are obligated to cover costs associated with compliance  if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated  or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated  the ability of these tenants to cover costs could be adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ada  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and our ability to make distributions to shareholders 
in addition  we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations  building codes and other land use regulations  as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties 
we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policies on our properties could subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties 
under the terms and conditions of the leases currently in force on our properties  tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons  air  water  land or property  on or off the premises  due to activities conducted on the properties  except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents 
additionally  tenants are generally required  at the tenant s expense  to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease  liability and full replacement value property damage insurance policies 
our largest tenant  the federal government is not required to maintain property insurance at all 
we have obtained comprehensive liability  casualty  flood and rental loss insurance policies on our properties 
all of these policies may involve substantial deductibles and certain exclusions 
in addition  we cannot assure you that our tenants will properly maintain their insurance policies or have the ability to pay the deductibles 
should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above  or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy  we could lose all or part of our capital invested in  and anticipated revenue from  one or more of the properties  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition  as well as our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred in new york and washington  dc on september   and other acts of violence or war may affect any market on which our common shares trade  the markets in which we operate  our operations and our profitability 
terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations 
these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact the value of our properties through damage  destruction  loss or increased security costs 
the terrorism insurance that we obtain may not be sufficient to cover loss for damages to our properties as a result of terrorist attacks 
in addition  certain losses resulting from these types of events are uninsurable and others would not be covered by our current terrorism insurance 
additional terrorism insurance may not be available at a reasonable price or at all 
the united states may enter into armed conflicts in the future 
the consequences of any armed conflicts are unpredictable  and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our business 
any of these events could result in increased volatility in or damage to the united states and worldwide financial markets and economy 
they also could result in a continuation of the current economic uncertainty in the united states or abroad 
adverse economic conditions could affect the ability of our tenants to pay rent  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition  as well as our ability to make distributions to our shareholders  and may result in volatility in the market price for our common shares 
tax risks of our business and structure if we fail to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we will not be able to deduct our distributions  and our income will be subject to taxation 
we elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code commencing with our short taxable year ended december   which affords us significant tax advantages 
the requirements for qualification as a reit  however  are complex and our management has limited experience in operating a reit 
if we fail to meet these requirements and do not qualify for certain relief provisions  our distributions to our shareholders will not be deductible by us and we will be subject to a corporate level tax on our taxable income 
this would substantially reduce our cash available to make distributions to our shareholders 
in addition  incurring corporate income tax liability might cause us to borrow funds  liquidate some of our investments or take other steps that could negatively affect our operating results 
moreover  if our reit status is terminated because of our failure to meet a reit qualification requirement or if we voluntarily revoke our election  unless relief provisions applicable to certain reit qualification failures apply  we would be disqualified from electing treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which reit status is lost 
distribution requirements relating to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes limit our flexibility in executing our business plan 
our business plan contemplates growth through acquisitions 
to qualify and maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we generally are required to distribute to our shareholders at least of our reit taxable income each year 
reit taxable income is determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and by excluding net capital gains 
we are also required to pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than of our taxable income including net capital gains each year 
in addition  we are required to pay a nondeductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which certain distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of of our ordinary income for that calendar year  of our capital gain net income for the calendar year and any amount of our income that was not distributed in prior years 
we have distributed  and intend to distribute  to our shareholders all or substantially all of our taxable reit income each year in order to comply with the distribution requirements of the internal revenue code and to avoid federal income tax and the nondeductible excise tax 
our distribution requirements limit our ability to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures through retained earnings 
thus  our ability to grow through acquisitions will be limited if we are unable to obtain debt or equity financing 
in addition  differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses in arriving at reit taxable income and the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow funds to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a reit 
moreover  even if we maintain our status as a reit  the net income of the taxable reit subsidiaries owned by our operating partnership will be subject to federal  state and local income taxes at regular corporate rates 
our disposal of properties may have negative implications  including unfavorable tax consequences 
if we make a sale of a property directly or through an entity that is treated as a partnership or a disregarded entity  for federal income tax purposes  and it is deemed to be a sale of dealer property or inventory  the sale may be deemed to be a prohibited transaction under federal tax laws applicable to reits  in which case our gain  or our share of the gain  from the sale would be subject to a penalty tax 
if we believe that a sale of a property might be treated as a prohibited transaction  we may dispose of that property through a taxable reit subsidiary  in which case the gain from the sale would be subject to corporate income tax but not the prohibited transaction tax 
we cannot assure you  however  that the internal revenue service will not assert successfully that sales of properties that we make directly or through an entity that is treated as a partnership or a disregarded entity  for federal income tax purposes  rather than through a taxable reit subsidiary  are sales of dealer property or inventory  in which case the penalty tax would apply 
we may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could reduce the market price of our securities 
at any time  the federal income tax laws governing reits or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended 
any of those new laws or interpretations may take effect retroactively and could adversely affect us or the market price of our securities 
if we or our predecessor entity failed to qualify as an s corporation for any of our tax years prior to our initial public offering  we may fail to qualify as a reit 
to qualify as a reit  we may not have at the close of any year undistributed earnings and profits accumulated in any non reit year  including undistributed earnings and profits accumulated in any non reit year for which we or our predecessor  first potomac realty investment trust  inc  did not qualify as an s corporation 
although we believe that we and our predecessor corporation qualified as an s corporation for federal income tax purposes for all tax years prior to our initial public offering  if it is determined that we did not so qualify  we will not qualify as a reit 
any such failure to qualify may also prevent us from qualifying as a reit for any of the following four tax years 
risks related to an investment in our common shares our common shares trade in a limited market which could hinder your ability to sell our common shares 
our equity market capitalization places us at the low end of market capitalization among all reits 
because of our small market capitalization  many of our investors are individuals 
our common shares experience limited trading volume  and many investors may not be interested in owning our common shares because of the inability to acquire or sell a substantial block of our common shares at one time 
this illiquidity could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares 
in addition  a shareholder may not be able to borrow funds using our common shares as collateral because lenders may be unwilling to accept the pledge of common shares having such a limited market 
any substantial sale of our common shares could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common shares 
the market price and trading volume of our common shares may be volatile 
the market price of our common shares may become highly volatile and be subject to wide fluctuations 
in addition  the trading volume in our common shares may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur 
some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common shares include actual or anticipated declines in our quarterly operating results or distributions  reductions in our funds from operations  increases in market interest rates that lead purchasers of our securities to demand a higher dividend yield  changes in market valuations of similar companies  adverse market reaction to any increased indebtedness we incur in the future  additions or departures of key management personnel  actions by institutional shareholders  speculation in the press or investment community  and general market and economic conditions 
broad market fluctuations could negatively impact the market price of our common shares 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many companies that have been unrelated to these companies operating performances 
these broad market fluctuations could reduce the market price of our common shares 
furthermore  our operating results and prospects may be below the expectations of investors or may be lower than those of companies with comparable market capitalizations  which could lead to a material decline in the market price of our common shares 
an increase in market interest rates may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares 
one of the factors that investors may consider in deciding whether to buy or sell our common shares is our distribution rate as a percentage of our share price  relative to market interest rates 
if market interest rates increase  prospective investors may desire a higher distribution rate on our common shares or seek securities paying higher dividends or interest 
the market price of our common shares likely will be based primarily on the earnings that we derive from rental income with respect to our properties and our related distributions to shareholders  and not from the underlying appraised value of the properties themselves 
as a result  interest rate fluctuations and capital market conditions can affect the market price of our common shares 
for instance  if interest rates rise without an increase in our distribution rate  the market price of our common shares could decrease because potential investors may require a higher yield on our common shares as market rates on interest bearing securities  such as bonds  rise 
in addition  rising interest rates would result in increased interest expense on our variable rate debt  thereby adversely affecting cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and make distributions to our shareholders 
shares eligible for future sale may have adverse effects on our share price 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  of future sales of common shares  or the availability of shares for future sales  on the market price of our common shares 
sales of substantial amounts of common shares  including up to approximately  common shares issuable upon i the redemption of units of our operating partnership  and ii exercise of options  or the perception that these sales could occur  may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common shares and impede our ability to raise capital 
we also may issue from time to time additional common shares or preferred shares or units of our operating partnership in connection with the acquisition of properties  and we may grant demand or piggyback registration rights in connection with these issuances 
sales of substantial amounts of securities or the perception that these sales could occur may adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common shares 
in addition  the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital through a sale of additional equity securities
