item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
restatement of financial statements on february   the office of the chief accountant of the sec issued a letter to the american institute of certified public accountants the sec letter expressing its views regarding certain operating lease accounting issues and their application under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
following the release of the sec letter  many restaurant companies and retailers reviewed their previous interpretation of these lease accounting issues and announced that they would restate their results for previous periods 
on march   management and the audit committee of the board of directors concluded that certain of our historical methods of accounting for operating leases were not in accordance with gaap  and that we would restate certain of our previously issued consolidated financial statements 
with respect to rent holidays  the sec letter states that pursuant to the response in paragraph of financial accounting standards board fasb technical bulletin  accounting for operating leases with scheduled rent increases  rent holidays in an operating lease should be recognized by the lessee on a straight line basis over the lease term including any rent holiday period unless another systematic and rational allocation is more representative of the time pattern in which leased property is physically employed 
the period from when leased land is made available to us for the construction of a new restaurant and when the lease payments begin is a rent holiday 
since we did not previously recognize rent expense during the rent holiday period  we were understating rent expense during the construction period  and overstating rent during subsequent periods 
we have made restatement adjustments to recognize straight line rent expense beginning on the date that we took possession of the leased land or premises 
tenant improvement incentives are typically provided by landlords to pay a portion of the cost associated with constructing improvements on the leased premises 
we do not typically receive tenant improvement allowances on our leases 
however  we received a tenant improvement allowance on one lease during we recognized the allowance as a reduction in the capitalized amount of the leasehold improvements  thereby reducing the related depreciation 
the sec letter states that such allowances should be recorded as deferred rent and amortized as reductions to rent expense over the lease term 
we have made adjustments to our consolidated balance sheet to record the allowance as deferred rent 
these adjustments had no net impact on our consolidated statements of earnings 
these adjustments  because the tenant improvement allowance was received during  had no impact on our consolidated statement of cash flows 
prior to our fiscal year  we did not recognize rent expense on leases with escalating rental obligations using the required straight line rent method 
beginning with leases entered into in fiscal  we have recognized rent expense by applying the straight line rent method 
for leases on restaurants opened during our and fiscal years  we recognized depreciation expense for leasehold improvements using economic lives that were longer than the time periods used for calculating straight line rent expense on the underlying leases 
beginning with leases entered into in fiscal  we have recognized depreciation expense for leasehold improvements using a useful life that is consistent with the time period used for straight line rent calculations 
for purpose of straight line rent expense and depreciating leasehold improvements  we use the estimated lease term  inclusive of one renewal period 
we have made adjustments to the prior period consolidated financial statements to correct these errors 
we did not amend our previously filed annual reports on form k or quarterly reports on form q for the restatement  and the financial statements and related financial information contained in such reports should no longer be relied upon 
prior to the issuance of the sec letter  we issued a press release on february  setting forth our unaudited consolidated statement of earnings for the fiscal year ended december  the net earnings reported on the consolidated statement of earnings for the fiscal year ended december  contained in this annual report on form k is lower than the previously issued unaudited results by million  or per diluted share 
this change resulted from the change in accounting for operating leases  the correction of other errors as described in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  a subsequent event described in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  and the accrual of additional audit fees associated with the restatement 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations gives effect to the restatement and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
overview we are a leading casual dining restaurant company operating o charley s restaurants in states in the southeast and midwest  ninety nine restaurants in seven northeastern states  and six stoney river restaurants in the southeast and midwest 
we also have one restaurant in michigan operated by a franchisee and another restaurant located in louisiana operated by a joint venture franchisee in which we have a financial interest 
fiscal years end on the last sunday of the calendar year 
fiscal  and each consisted of weeks 
we have one reportable segment 
during the third quarter of  of our o charley s restaurants  or approximately of the chain  were affected by hurricane ivan 
we estimate that the combination of lost sales and required repairs after the storm adversely affected our earning in fiscal by approximately  before tax  or approximately per diluted share 
all of these stores have substantially recovered and are back to normal operating capacity 
following is an explanation of certain items in our consolidated statement of earnings revenues consist of restaurant sales and  to a lesser extent  commissary sales and franchise revenues 
restaurant sales include food and beverage sales and are net of applicable state and local sales taxes 
commissary sales represent sales to outside parties consisting primarily of sales of o charley s branded food items  primarily salad dressings  to retail grocery chains  mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs 
franchise revenue consists of development fees and royalties on sales of franchised units 
our development fees for franchisees in which we do not have an ownership interest are generally  for the first two stores and  for each additional store opened by the franchisee 
the 
table of contents development fees are recognized during the reporting period in which the developed store begins operation 
the royalties are recognized in revenue in the period corresponding to the franchisee s sales 
cost of food and beverage primarily consists of the costs of beef  poultry  seafood  produce and alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages 
the two most significant commodities that may affect our cost of food and beverage are beef and poultry  which account for approximately to and to  respectively  of our overall cost of food and beverage 
generally  temporary increases in these costs are not passed on to customers  however  we have  in the past  generally adjusted menu prices to compensate for increased costs of a more permanent nature 
payroll and benefits include payroll and related costs and expenses directly relating to restaurant level activities including restaurant management salaries and bonuses  hourly wages for restaurant level employees  payroll taxes  workers compensation  various health  life and dental insurance programs  vacation expense and sick pay 
we have an incentive bonus plan that compensates restaurant management for achieving and exceeding certain restaurant level financial targets and performance goals 
restaurant operating costs include occupancy and other expenses at the restaurant level  except property and equipment depreciation and amortization 
supplies  rent  supervisory salaries  bonuses and related expenses  management training salaries  general liability and property insurance  property taxes  utilities  repairs and maintenance  outside services and credit card fees account for the major expenses in this category 
advertising  general and administrative expenses include all advertising and home office administrative functions that support the existing restaurant base and provide the infrastructure for future growth 
advertising  executive management and support staff salaries  bonuses  stock based compensation and related expenses  data processing  legal and accounting expenses  and office expenses account for the major expenses in this category 
this category also includes all severance related expenses 
depreciation and amortization primarily includes depreciation on property and equipment calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets or the expected lease term for leasehold improvements  if shorter 
preopening costs represent costs incurred prior to a restaurant opening and are expensed as incurred 
these costs also include straight line rent related to leased properties from the period of time between when the leased property is physically employed and the date on which the restaurant opens 
the amount of preopening costs incurred in any one period includes costs incurred during the period for restaurants opened and under development 
our preopening costs may vary significantly from quarter to quarter primarily due to the timing of restaurant openings 

table of contents results of operations the following information should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
the following table reflects our operating results for fiscal years   and as a percentage of total revenues unless otherwise indicated

table of contents the following tables set forth certain unaudited financial and other restaurant data relating to company owned restaurants number of restaurants o charley s restaurants in operation  beginning of year restaurants opened restaurant closed in operation  end of year ninety nine restaurants in operation  beginning of year restaurants opened restaurants closed in operation  end of year stoney river restaurants in operation  beginning of year restaurants opened in operation  end of year average weekly sales per restaurant o charley s ninety nine stoney river change in same restaurant sales o charley s ninety nine stoney river change in customer visits o charley s ninety nine stoney river average check o charley s ninety nine stoney river when computing same restaurant sales and customer visits  restaurants open for at least weeks are compared from period to period 
change in customer visits is not available for ninety nine prior to as the o charley s methodology of counting customer visits was adopted subsequent to the completion of the acquisition and we are unable to recast customer visits using that same methodology 

table of contents fiscal year compared with fiscal year revenues during  total revenues increased million  or  to million from million in total revenues for included weeks of sales from the operations of ninety nine restaurants in the first fiscal quarter of compared to weeks of ninety nine results in the first fiscal quarter of we acquired ninety nine on january  o charley s restaurant sales increased million  or  to million during as a result of same restaurant sales increases of and the addition of restaurants during the past months 
the same restaurant sales increase was comprised of a increase in the number of customer visits partially offset by a decrease in our average check 
ninety nine restaurant sales increased million  or  during the year over year sales increase was primarily related to same restaurant sales increases of in and the addition of new restaurants over the past months 
the same restaurant sales increase was comprised of a check average increase partially offset by a decline in customer visits 
stoney river restaurant sales increased million  or  during due primarily to same restaurant sales increases of 
the same restaurant sales increase was comprised of a improvement in the average check coupled with a increase in customer counts 
cost of food and beverage during  we continued to experience higher food costs  a trend that began during the second quarter of we estimate that food cost inflation  as compared to the same prior year period  was approximately in  consisting primarily of higher poultry  pork and cheese costs 
commodity cost increases resulted in an increase in the cost of food and beverage of of restaurant sales compared to fiscal we estimate that commodity cost inflation adversely affected our diluted earnings per share by approximately in as compared to the prior year 
during and  poultry represented  on average  approximately to of our cost of food and beverage 
during  our price of purchasing poultry was approximately higher compared to the prior year 
historically  we have not entered into contracts to fix poultry prices and  accordingly  we were subject to weekly market price fluctuations during fiscal and payroll and benefits during  payroll and benefits increased basis points as a percentage of restaurant sales compared to the same prior year period 
higher store level bonus expense  payroll taxes and worker s compensation expenses were partially offset by lower hourly health insurance costs 
the higher store level bonus expenses  and the resulting increase in payroll taxes  are related to the improving sales trends and margins at our o charley s stores 
the increase in worker s compensation expenses related to more favorable cost trends late in the lower hourly insurance costs are related to better than expected claims experience compared to restaurant operating costs restaurant operating costs during decreased as a percentage of restaurant sales as compared to primarily due to decreased supervisory expenses partially offset by increased rent expense from sale and leaseback transactions 
during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of we completed sale and leaseback transactions pursuant to which we sold o charley s restaurant properties for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million 
the leases that we have entered into in connection with the million sale and leaseback transactions will require us to expense on a straight line basis approximately million annually  including the amortization of the million deferred gain over the year lease term 
the reduction in supervisory expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales was due to a reduction in the number of operational supervisory positions during the first quarter of 
table of contents advertising  general and administrative expenses during  advertising expenditures increased to million from million in and  as a percentage of total revenues  declined to from in the prior year 
the decrease in advertising expenditures as a percentage of total revenues is primarily due to economies of scale by having a higher concentration of stores in existing markets 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  and as a percentage of total revenues  increased to from in the prior year 
the increase in general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  is due primarily to increased incentive compensation expense 
during  we shifted the emphasis of our equity based compensation plans from stock options to restricted stock 
during  the expense associated with these equity based compensation plans reduced earnings by per diluted share compared to per diluted share during fiscal depreciation and amortization during  depreciation and amortization of property and equipment decreased as a percentage of total revenues 
the decrease was primarily attributable to approximately million of depreciation that was eliminated as a result of the sale and leaseback transactions completed during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of pre opening costs during  pre opening costs declined as a percentage of total revenues due primarily to fewer restaurant openings compared to the same prior year periods 
we estimate average pre opening costs of approximately  for each new o charley s restaurant  approximately  for each new stoney river restaurant and approximately  for each new ninety nine restaurant 
interest expense interest expense decreased during compared to the prior year as a result of the reduction of amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility with million of aggregate gross proceeds from the sale and leaseback of o charley s restaurant properties 
interest expense during reflects million of senior subordinated notes at a fixed rate of  approximately million outstanding on our million bank revolver accruing interest at one month libor plus  and other debt including capitalized lease obligations and prepaid financing costs that accounted for approximately million in interest expense during approximately million of the senior subordinated notes have been effectively converted through interest rate swap agreements into a variable interest rate obligation using the six month libor rate in arrears plus income taxes our effective income tax rate in fiscal was compared to in the reduction resulted primarily from an increase in the net benefit from the fica tip and other credits from million in to million in our tax rates in both years have been adjusted for the restatement associated with lease accounting  during which we also adjusted our tax accounts to correct prior year computation errors as well as to adjust our provision for revised state apportionment factors that we calculated as a part of the filing of our fiscal tax return during the fourth quarter of fiscal year compared with fiscal year revenues during  total revenues increased million  or  primarily related to the inclusion of million of sales from the operations of ninety nine restaurants since we acquired that concept on january  excluding the revenues of the ninety nine restaurants  revenues increased million  or 
o charley s restaurant sales increased million  or  as a result of the net addition of restaurants during  comprised of new restaurants opened and the closure of two restaurants 
same restaurant sales for the 
table of contents o charley s restaurants decreased in as compared to  due principally to a decline in the number of customer visits 
during the third fiscal quarter of  we implemented sales building initiatives that improved customer visits at the o charley s restaurants during the third and fourth quarters of but adversely affected operating margins 
sales at our o charley s restaurants were negatively affected in fiscal when customers and employees at one of our o charley s restaurants were exposed to the hepatitis a virus 
see item legal proceedings 
we believe that the hepatitis a incident adversely affected sales at our nine knoxville  tennessee area restaurants during the fourth quarter of by approximately as compared to the same prior year period and adversely affected o charley s same restaurant sales and customer visits for the fourth quarter by approximately 
ninety nine restaurant sales were million for the period since its acquisition on january  same restaurant sales for ninety nine restaurants were up for  compared with stoney river restaurant sales increased million  or  due primarily to full year effect of the three new restaurants opened in  same restaurant sales increases of in as compared to and higher sales volumes at new restaurants 
cost of food and beverage beginning in the second quarter of and continuing through the end of  cost of food and beverage increased as a percentage of restaurant sales compared to the same prior year period as commodity costs  primarily the cost of red meat  poultry and lettuce  increased as compared to the same prior year period 
in addition to the higher commodity costs  the sales building initiatives we implemented during the third fiscal quarter of at our o charley s restaurants included promotions of lower priced items  and a price reduction on certain menu items  both of which increased our food cost as a percentage of restaurant sales 
payroll and benefits during  we improved the insurance benefits offered to o charley s and stoney river hourly employees to enable us to attract and retain the most qualified candidates available 
these improvements resulted in a million  or basis point  increase in our payroll and benefits costs and expenses in in addition to the improved insurance benefits  payroll and benefit costs increased as a percentage of restaurant sales in as a result of the higher average wage rates for the ninety nine managers and hourly co workers  lower average weekly sales at o charley s  which increased the percentage of fixed payroll costs  and increased service levels we introduced with the sales building plan at o charley s 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in restaurant level bonus expense 
restaurant management compensation is based  in part  on restaurant sales and profitability  and since both were below our annual targets we paid less bonus compensation during restaurant operating costs restaurant operating costs increased in as compared to the same prior year period primarily due to the higher base of restaurants that are leased by ninety nine  and to higher utility costs  primarily natural gas from increased usage due to inclement winter weather in the first quarter of and rate increases through the year 
these increases were partially offset by lower supervisory bonus expense in compared to the same prior year period 
restaurant supervisor compensation is based  in part  on restaurant sales and profitability  and since both were below our annual targets we paid less bonus compensation during advertising  general and administrative expenses in  advertising expenditures increased to million from million in and  as a percentage of total revenues  declined to in from in the increase in advertising was primarily due to the acquisition of ninety nine and as part of the sales building initiatives at o charley s 
advertising expenditures were lower  as a percentage of revenues  as ninety nine has historically spent less on advertising as a percent of restaurant sales compared to o charley s restaurants 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  and as a percentage of total revenues decreased to in from in during the first fiscal quarter of  we adopted a deferred compensation plan for the senior management of ninety nine that increased general and administrative costs 
in addition  we incurred incremental costs  primarily in 
table of contents salaries and related expenses  associated with operating multiple concepts  which increased general and administrative expense 
these increases were offset primarily by a decrease in bonus expense 
executive and senior management compensation is based  in part  on company sales and profitability  and since both were below our annual targets we incurred less bonus compensation during fiscal than during fiscal depreciation and amortization the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of total revenues in was primarily attributable to the acquisition of ninety nine  which leases all of its restaurants 
preopening costs in  preopening costs declined as a percentage of total revenues due primarily to lower average cost for each new restaurant opening in as compared to interest expense interest expense increased in primarily due to increased borrowings incurred to finance the acquisition of ninety nine coupled with higher average interest rates under our credit facility 
income taxes our income tax rate in was which is lower than the income tax rate in prior year 
this income tax rate reduction occurred primarily because of higher income tax credits  primarily fica tip credits  relative to the lower than expected earnings 
the tax credits increased as expected in while pre tax earnings decreased in diluted weighted shares the increase in diluted weighted shares relates primarily to the shares issued and committed to be issued in connection with the acquisition of ninety nine 
we issued  shares at the closing of the acquisition   shares on the first anniversary  and  shares on the second anniversary and will issue an additional  shares on the third anniversary of the closing of the acquisition and  shares on each of the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the closing 
since the remaining shares to be issued are not contingent on any future event other than the passage of time  they are included in the weighted share calculations 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of capital have historically been cash provided by operations  borrowings under our credit facilities  capitalized lease obligations and sales of common stock 
our principal capital needs have historically arisen from property and equipment additions  acquisitions  and payments on long term debt and capitalized lease obligations 
in addition  we lease a substantial number of our restaurants under operating leases  as described below  and have substantial operating lease obligations 
our working capital historically has had current liabilities in excess of current assets due to cash reinvestments in long term assets  mostly property and equipment additions  which we do not believe indicates a lack of liquidity 
on january   we completed the acquisition of ninety nine restaurant and pub for million in cash and approximately million shares of our common stock  plus the assumption of certain liabilities of ninety nine 
of the stock portion of the purchase price  we delivered  shares at closing   shares on the first anniversary and  on the second anniversary and will deliver  on the third anniversary of the closing and  shares on each of the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the closing 
in conjunction with the acquisition of ninety nine  we entered into a million senior secured credit facility  comprised of a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan  to fund the cash portion of the purchase price of ninety nine  repay the previous revolving credit facility and provide capital for future growth 
this credit facility remained in place through the first four weeks of the fourth quarter of and was secured by all our 
table of contents tangible and intangible assets and the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
the revolving credit facility had outstanding borrowings of million at october   which accrued interest at a rate of libor plus 
the term loan balance at the end of the third quarter of was million  which accrued interest at a rate of libor plus 
the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under this credit facility at the end of the third quarter of was  compared to at the end of the same prior year period 
in the fourth quarter of  we amended and restated our credit facility and issued million aggregate principal amount of unsecured  senior subordinated notes due the proceeds from the note offering were used to repay the term loan and to repay a portion of the revolving credit loan under our bank credit facility 
interest on the notes accrues at a fixed rate of and is payable semi annually on may and november of each year commencing may  the notes mature on november  the notes are unsecured  senior subordinated obligations and rank junior in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior debt as defined in the indenture governing the notes 
at any time before november   we may redeem up to of the original aggregate principal amount of the notes at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest  with the cash proceeds of certain equity offerings 
we may also redeem all or a portion of the notes on or after november  at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the notes 
the notes are guaranteed on an unsecured  senior subordinated basis by certain of our subsidiaries 
our current bank credit facility consists of a revolving credit facility in a maximum principal amount of million 
the facility has a four year term maturing in  and bears interest  at our option  at either libor plus a specified margin ranging from to based on certain financial ratios or the base rate  which is the higher of the lender s prime rate and the federal funds rate plus  plus a specified margin from to based on certain financial ratios 
the credit facility imposes restrictions on us with respect to the incurrence of additional indebtedness  sales of assets  mergers  acquisitions  joint ventures  investments  repurchases of stock and the payment of dividends 
in addition  the credit facility requires us to comply with certain specified financial covenants  including covenants and ratios relating to our senior secured leverage  maximum adjusted leverage  minimum fixed charge coverage  minimum asset coverage and maximum capital expenditures 
the company was in compliance with or had received waivers of compliance with such covenants at december  the credit facility contains certain events of default  including an event of default resulting from certain changes in control 
all amounts owing under the facility are secured by of the equity interests we own of each of our existing and future subsidiaries and all of the tangible and intangible assets  other than real property acquired after the date of the credit facility and equipment  of us and substantially all of our subsidiaries 
the lenders may  under certain circumstances  also require that we pledge such real estate and equipment as collateral 
during the fourth quarter of  we also completed two sale and leaseback transactions 
the first transaction  completed on october   involved the sale of of our o charley s restaurant properties for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million 
the second transaction  completed on november   involved the sale of five of our o charley s restaurants for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million 
during the first quarter of  we completed a sale and leaseback transaction involving the sale of six of our o charley s restaurants for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million 
all of these sales were made to an unrelated entity who then leased the properties back to us 
the leases that we entered into in connection with these transactions require us to make additional future minimum lease payments aggregating approximately million over the year term of the leases  or an average of approximately million annually 
the leases also provide for the payment of additional rent beginning in the sixth year of the lease term based on increases in the consumer price index 
the net proceeds from these transactions were used to pay down indebtedness under our bank credit facility 
from time to time  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements with certain financial institutions 
these swap agreements may effectively convert some of our obligations that bear interest at variable rates into fixed rate obligations and may effectively convert some of our obligations that bear interest at fixed rates into variable rate obligations 
as of december   we had interest rate swap agreements with commercial banks  which effectively fixed the interest rate on million of our outstanding variable rate debt at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 
the corresponding floating rates of interest received on those notional amounts are based on one month libor rates and are typically reset on a monthly basis  which is intended to coincide with the pricing adjustments on our credit facility 
the swap agreement relating to the million of our indebtedness expires in january and is accounted for as a cash flow hedge 
during the first quarter of  we entered into additional interest rate swap agreements with a financial institution that effectively convert a portion of the fixed rate indebtedness related to the million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due into variable rate obligations 
the total notional amount of these swaps was 
table of contents million and is based on the six month libor rate in arrears plus a specified margin  the average of which is 
the terms and conditions of these swaps mirror the interest terms and conditions on our senior subordinated notes due and are accounted for as fair value hedges 
these swap agreements expire in november the company s weighted average interest rate for and was and  respectively 
in october  we announced an authorization to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
any repurchases will be made from time to time in open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions at our discretion 
to date  we have not repurchased any shares of our common stock under this authorization 
any repurchases will be funded with borrowings under our bank credit facility 
net cash flows used by investing activities included capital expenditures incurred principally for building new restaurants  improvements to existing restaurants and technological improvements at our home office 
capital expenditures were million in  excluding million of new restaurant equipment financed through capitalized lease obligations  compared to million in and million in during  we paid approximately million in debt issuance costs  which will be amortized over the matching term of the related debt instrument 
our capital budget includes approximately to million for capital expenditures  excluding new restaurant equipment financed through capitalized lease obligations 
these expenditures are for an estimated to additional o charley s restaurants  a similar number of new ninety nine restaurants  two additional stoney river restaurants  and improvements to existing restaurants and the commissary and home office additions 
there can be no assurance that actual capital expenditures for will not vary significantly from budgeted amounts based upon a number of factors  including the timing of additional purchases of restaurant sites and the opening of new restaurants

we have historically produced insufficient cash flow from operations to fund our working capital and capital expenditures and  accordingly  our ability to meet our anticipated capital needs is dependent on our ability to continue to access external financing  particularly borrowings under our credit facility

any acquisitions  joint ventures or other growth opportunities may require additional external financing 
there can be no assurances that such sources of financing will be available to us or that any such financing would not negatively impact our earnings

joint ventures and franchise financing arrangement in connection with our franchising initiative  we may from time to time enter into joint venture arrangements to develop and operate o charley s restaurants 
for any franchisee in which we have an ownership interest  we may make loans to the joint venture entity and or guarantee certain of its debt and obligations 
on november   we entered into a program agreement with ge capital franchise finance corporation 
under the terms of the program agreement  ge capital franchise finance corporation will provide financing to certain qualified franchisees of our o charley s restaurants typically those in which we have an ownership interest in a maximum aggregate amount of  such financing may be used to fund the acquisition  construction and installation of the land  building and equipment for new o charley s restaurants opened by such franchisees or to fund a franchisee s acquisition from us of the land  building and equipment for existing o charley s restaurants 
under the program  financing will be provided in the maximum amount of million per location or of the total acquisition and construction costs relating to each restaurant  whichever is less 
in consideration of the lender s agreement to make financing available under the program to certain of our franchisees  we have agreed  subject to limitations  to guarantee payment to the lender of any ultimate net losses it may suffer in connection with loans under the program 
our maximum liability under such ultimate net loss guarantee is equal to the lesser of of the sum of the original funded principal balances of all loans under the program and million 
in addition to the ultimate net loss guarantee  we have agreed to purchase any such loans that have been declared in default by the lender if the sum of the original funded principal balances of all loans under the program is less than million 
subject to certain exceptions  our guarantee of loans under the program shall remain in effect for as long as the loans are outstanding

critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows lease accounting equity based compensation property and equipment goodwill and trademarks impairment of long lived assets 
table of contents lease accounting on february   the office of the chief accountant of the sec issued a letter to the american institute of certified public accountants the sec letter expressing its views regarding certain accounting principles relating to three aspects of lease accounting the period of time used for the amortization of leasehold improvements  the recognition of rent expense when the lease term in an operating lease contains a period of free or reduced rents commonly referred to as a rent holiday  and accounting for landlord improvement incentives to tenants 
in light of this letter  we determined that our historical methods of accounting for rent holidays and tenant improvement allowances were not in accordance with gaap 
as a result  we restated prior period financial statements and changed our policy for accounting for operating leases 
our new policy for lease accounting involves recognizing rent on a straight line basis from the time we are committed to a leased property  which is when all contingencies associated with the delivery of the property by the landlord are taken care of  to the end of the lease term  inclusive of one renewal period 
the lease term  for purposes of straight line rent calculations and the useful life over which leasehold improvements are depreciated  is the shorter of the estimated useful life of the leased property or the base lease term  inclusive of one renewal period 
we also recognize tenant allowances as a deferred rent liability and amortize them over the lease term  inclusive of one renewal period 
equity based compensation on december   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
this standard requires expensing of stock options and other share based payments beginning in  and supersedes fasb s earlier rule the original sfas that had allowed companies to choose between expensing stock options or showing pro forma disclosure only 
we are continuing to evaluate the impact of this new standard on our earnings and currently expect that the impact on fiscal earnings of adopting this new standard in the third fiscal quarter of will be in the range of to per diluted share 
in addition to our stock option plans  we grant restricted stock and restricted stock units as part of our equity based compensation arrangements 
many of these restricted stock plans have performance based vesting features  where the number of shares that vest each year depends upon our achievement of certain financial targets 
in some plans  the shares that do not vest in any year are forfeited  while in other plans  the shares that do not vest in any year are available to vest in future years depending upon our cumulative achievement of multi year financial targets 
the accounting for these compensation arrangements is complicated and requires significant judgment on the part of management related to the ultimate number of shares that will vest  as well as overall impact of both on the basic and diluted weighted average share calculation 
the performance based awards require variable accounting under apb no 
and financial accounting standards board interpretation we believe that our accounting policy for equity based compensation provides for a reasonable and systematic means of recognizing the expense over the period of time that we derive the benefits of the employee service 
during  the expense associated with our equity based compensation plans reduced earnings by approximately per diluted share 
we anticipate the reduction of earnings in associated with the expense of equity based awards to be to per diluted share 
property and equipment as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  our property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over the following estimated useful lives building and improvements years  furniture  fixtures and equipment to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the asset s estimated useful life or the expected lease term  inclusive of one renewal period 
equipment under capital leases is amortized to its expected value at the end of the lease term 
gains or losses are recognized upon the disposal of property and equipment  and the asset and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts 
maintenance  repairs and betterments that do not enhance the value of or increase the life of the assets are expensed as incurred 
inherent in the policies regarding property and equipment are certain significant management judgments and estimates  including useful life  residual value to which the asset is depreciated  the expected value at the end of the lease term for equipment under capital leases  and the determination as to what constitutes enhancing the value of or increasing 
table of contents the life of assets 
these significant estimates and judgments  coupled with the fact that the ultimate useful life and economic value at the end of a lease are typically not known until the passage of time  through proper maintenance of the asset  or through continued development and maintenance of a given market in which a store operates can  under certain circumstances  produce distorted or inaccurate depreciation and amortization or  in some cases result in a write down of the value of the assets under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
see critical accounting policy impairment of long lived assets below 
we believe that our accounting policy for property and equipment provides a reasonably accurate means by which the costs associated with an asset are recognized in expense as the cash flows associated with the asset s use are realized 
goodwill and trademarks as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  as of december   we no longer amortize goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets 
beginning in fiscal  we adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangibles 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
at december   we have million in goodwill and million in indefinite life intangible assets shown in our consolidated balance sheets related to the acquisition of ninety nine restaurant and pub 
the determination of the estimated useful lives and whether these assets are impaired involves significant judgments based upon short and long term projections of future performance 
certain of these forecasts reflect assumptions regarding our ability to successfully integrate the ninety nine concept and to maintain the financial performance that this concept has experienced over its recent history 
we have relied on the judgments of outside valuation experts in evaluating the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets to the extent that the comparative information contained in our report is appropriate information to use in assessing whether these assets are impaired 
changes in strategy  new accounting pronouncements and or market conditions may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances 
for example  we incurred an after tax charge of million  or per diluted share  which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of the beginning of fiscal associated with the adoption of sfas no 
the charge was related to the goodwill associated with the stoney river acquisition 
on january   we acquired ninety nine restaurant and pub for million in cash and approximately million shares of our common stock 
we completed a valuation of the assets and liabilities of ninety nine and allocated the purchase price to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities  including million related to trademarks  with the remaining amount of million being allocated to goodwill 
we selected the first day of each new fiscal year as the date on which we will test the goodwill and trademarks for impairment 
we completed a valuation of the goodwill pursuant to sfas no 
as of december   the first day of fiscal and our valuation showed that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its net book value and no impairment charge was needed 
impairment of long lived assets as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the judgments made related to the ultimate expected useful life and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying value of an asset are affected by such issues as ongoing maintenance of the asset  continued development of a given market within which a store operates  including the presence of traffic generating businesses in the area  and our ability to operate the store efficiently and effectively 
we assess the projected cash flows 
table of contents and carrying values at the restaurant level  which is the level where identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the long lived assets associated with a restaurant may not be recoverable 
we believe that our accounting policy for impairment of long lived assets provides reasonable assurance that any assets that are impaired are written down to their fair value and a charge is taken in earnings on a timely basis 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs 
sfas no 
amends guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
sfas no 
requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead costs be based on the normal capacity of production facilities 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
in we are still evaluating the components of this new standard and do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
sfas no 
r will be effective for us beginning july  we are continuing to evaluate the effect of adoption on our consolidated financial statements and believe that the estimated impact in fiscal will be approximately to per diluted share 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for real estate time sharing transactions 
the fasb issued this statement as a result of the guidance provided in aicpa statement of position sop  accounting for real estate time sharing transactions 
sop applies to all real estate time sharing transactions 
among other items  the sop provides guidance on the recording of credit losses and the treatment of selling costs  but does not change the revenue recognition guidance in sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  for real estate time sharing transactions 
sfas no 
amends statement no 
to reference the guidance provided in sop sfas no 
also amends sfas no 
 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects  to state that sop provides the relevant guidance on accounting for incidental operations and costs related to the sale of real estate time sharing transactions 
sfas no 
is effective for years beginning after june   with restatements of previously issued financial statements prohibited 
this statement is not applicable to us 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment to opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
statement no 
eliminates certain differences in the guidance in opinion no 
as compared to the guidance contained in standards issued by the international accounting standards board 
the amendment to opinion no 
eliminates the fair value exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
such an exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in periods beginning after june  earlier application is permitted for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in periods beginning after december  we do not expect adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the cost of food  labor  equipment  land and construction costs could adversely affect our operations 
a majority of our employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws 
as a result of increased competition and the low unemployment rates in the markets in which our restaurants are located  we have continued to increase wages and benefits in order to attract and retain management personnel and hourly employees 
in addition  most of our leases require us to pay taxes  insurance  maintenance  repairs and utility costs  and these costs are subject to inflationary pressures 
commodity inflation has had a significant impact on our cost of food and beverage over the past months 
we attempt to offset the effect of inflation through periodic menu price increases  economies of scale in purchasing and cost controls and efficiencies at our restaurants 

table of contents outlook for our expectations for are for same restaurant sales increases of to for o charley s and to for ninety nine 
we expect to open between and new company owned o charley s restaurants  a similar number of ninety nine restaurants  and two new stoney river legendary steaks restaurants during the new stoney river restaurants will be the first additions to the chain since the restarting of stoney river restaurant development will require preopening  training  and other expenses of approximately million in fiscal we also expect continued improvement in operating margins  an effective tax rate of between and for the fiscal year  and a moderation of commodity cost increases in we have already purchased or contracted for approximately of our estimated beef requirements  approximately of our estimated poultry requirements  and approximately of our estimated pork requirements for while we have not provided earnings guidance for the full fiscal year  we have provided estimates of the impact of our equity based compensation plans on full year results 
we expect that expenses relating to our restricted stock plans will reduce fiscal net income by between and per diluted share 
while we continue to finalize our estimates of the impact of implementing sfas no 
r  we currently expect that the impact of beginning to expense stock options in the third quarter will be in the range of to per diluted share for fiscal there can be no assurance that actual performance for the first quarter or full year will not vary significantly from our expectations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing  investing  and cash management activities 
we utilize a balanced mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposures to changes in interest rates 
our fixed rate debt consists primarily of capitalized lease obligations and senior subordinated notes and our variable rate debt consists primarily of our revolving credit facility 
as an additional method of managing our interest rate exposure on our credit facility  at certain times we enter into interest rate swap agreements whereby we agree to pay over the life of the swaps a fixed interest rate payment on a notional amount and in exchange we receive a floating rate payment calculated on the same amount over the same time period 
the fixed interest rates are dependent upon market levels at the time the swaps are consummated 
the floating interest rates are generally based on the monthly libor rate and rates are typically reset on a monthly basis  which is intended to coincide with the pricing adjustments on our revolving credit facility 
at december   we had interest rate swap agreements with a financial institution that effectively converted a portion of the fixed rate indebtedness related to our million senior subordinated notes due into variable rate obligations 
the total notional amount of these swaps is million and is based on six month libor rates in arrears plus a specified margin  the average of which is 
the terms and conditions of these swaps mirror the interest terms and conditions on the notes 
these swap agreements expire in november also at december  and december   we had interest rate swap agreements with a financial institution that effectively converts a portion of the variable rate revolving line of credit into a fixed rate obligation 
the notional amount of these swaps is million and is based on one month libor plus a specified margin ranging from to 
the interest terms of these swaps mirror the interest terms on the debt 
these swap agreements expire in
